<h1 id="the-last-flight">the-last-flight</h1>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep! Shep, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Can’t make it, Cary. Can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Here, give me your arm! I’ll get you out of
here! Hang on there, Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella.</p>
<p><strong>a temperature chart</strong>: for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a
patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. Shep’s temperature
readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by a line on a
graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle
continues to RUMBLE.</p>
<p><strong>another chart</strong>: swings into view. This one is for
Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd
are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line continues and improves
considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked
NORMAL.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: The battle sounds are now
joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of energy or emotion,
Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform. Shep wears
dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He glances off.
We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital to a
wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost
eleven A. M. The battle’s RUMBLE drones on.</p>
<p><strong>shep and cary</strong>: stare up at the clock. Behind his
dark glasses, Shep’s left eye twitches.</p>
<p><strong>the clock</strong>: slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE
MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane
crashing, explosions. The final image is of a plane parked on the
ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we DISSOLVE
BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined up exactly with
the center of the propeller – the slowing propeller blades are replaced
by the clock’s hands – as if to symbolically suggest that the war has
ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING
of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 –
Armistice Day.</p>
<p><strong>shep and cary</strong>: sit motionless side-by-side on the
cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, the old guerre is finie.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What are ya gonna do now, Shep?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Get tight.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Stay tight.</p>
<p><strong>int. doctor’s office - not long after</strong>: A nurse opens
a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. Cary
carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have
passed through close behind them.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. You two
leaving us, eh? In a way, I’m sorry to release you two. I have no choice
in the matter.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What am I going to do, Major, about my– oh,
this rotten business?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under
the eye, eh, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Mm hm.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What the French call a tic. T-I-C, tic.
Little bothersome, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m afraid time’ll have to take care of
that. Time and normal living.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You two are returning to the United States,
I presume?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Ah, we haven’t decided.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’d take the first boat home. Well, here you
go.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I’d
undertake a systematic course of finger exercises – to, uh, stretch them
and loosen them up. In time, you’ll regain their full use.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Bye, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, there they go. Out to face life. And
their whole training was in preparation for death.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hospital - moments later</strong>: Shep and Cary exit
the building but pause outside the doorway. They’ve seen something
coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of its
path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter
through some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without
acknowledgment, and head into the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ext. doctor’s office - perhaps simultaneous</strong>: The
office window opens. The doctor – no longer in white but wearing his
uniform – and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a
little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and
Cary.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Why can’t they go on with flying? You know,
the air mails or something?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m afraid they’re unfit for further service
in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They fell, you know – six thousand meters.
Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement. Shattered both of
them. Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Spent bullets.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Spent bullets. That’s it. They’re like
projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy. They’ve described a
beautiful, high-arching trajectory. And now they’ve fallen back to
earth. Spent. Cooled off. Useless.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Oh, well, if they take care of themselves,
they’ll pull through all right.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Even if they do take care of themselves,
what good are they? What can you expect of them? I hate to think what
may become of them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hospital - not long after</strong>: Two uniformed men
with familiar faces – exuberant pilot Bill and reserved gunner Francis –
arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. Bill, with
his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs and
wave.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hello, Cary!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hi, Cary!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hello, Bill! Francis!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, I see you got yours.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yup. We crashed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Paris!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: See you in Paris!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the eiffel tower - night</strong>: A superimposed text
reads:</p>
<p><strong>ext. paris sidewalk - night</strong>: Strolling down the
sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our heroes – Bill,
Shep, Francis and Cary – in smart hats and dinner clothes.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: How ’bout a cocktail?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Not a bad idea at that.</p>
<p><strong>a glowing sign</strong>: made of light bulbs, outside the
building. It spells out CLARIDGE’S – a popular Parisian drinking
establishment for Anglo-Americans.</p>
<p><strong>int. claridge’s - night</strong>: Numerous shelves holding
numerous bottles of liquor. Employees in white jackets hurriedly rush in
and pull down a few bottles.</p>
<p><strong>int. claridge’s bar - lengthy panning shot</strong>: The
place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with
men smoking, drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover
our heroes entering, greeted by an employee who takes their hats.</p>
<p><strong>another view - near the bar</strong>: An attractive young
woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall opposite the bar
holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and she seems
to be in a world all to herself.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: still wearing a blank expression, clutches
the glass in two hands.</p>
<p><strong>the glass</strong>: in her hands. Between her fingers, we
glimpse its contents – a complete set of men’s false teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I beg your pardon. But, if I’m not too
inquisitive, would you mind telling me what IS that you’re drinking?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Teeth?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey, it’s teeth!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Teeth!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yup. It’s a full set – upper and lower.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: It’s a nice expression.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hey, how come you’re with those teeth?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I was just standing here. And a nice
gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding
his teeth for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth
for?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Said he wanted to biff somebody.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Just around to the right.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on, men! We’re liable to see a fight.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Would you like to come along?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind the
man’s teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, of course.</p>
<p><strong>flash cut - a man’s face</strong>: as it takes a combination
one-two punch from a pair of fists.</p>
<p><strong>flash cut - the man’s body</strong>: dropping unconscious to
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>our four heroes</strong>: enter a hallway just in time to see
two Claridge’s employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body.
Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and Bill are delighted anyway.
Bill brushes his hands with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the
punches himself:</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well. THAT’S all fixed.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Let’s go back.</p>
<p><strong>the bar</strong>: Nikki, no longer standing against the wall,
sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette
and holding an empty champagne glass. Our heroes enter and, glancing at
the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of searching, Cary spots her
at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, there she is.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, we missed it.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did something happen?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, they carried a guy out. Say! What’s
become of the teeth?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, the man came and got his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: He said thank you for holding his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I think he fell in an airplane in the war –
and got his teeth knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, why do you think he was in the war?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in
his buttonhole.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What makes you think he was a flyer?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: His eyes.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: His eyes? You can tell a flyer better by his
ears.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, what do you say we have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Sure, here’s some space.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hello, Jean!</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert. Qu’est-ce que
voulez-vous</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Martiniiii!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Could I have a champagne cocktail?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Certainment, Mademoiselle. Quatre Martinis
pour messieurs! Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Nikki?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nikki?!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki?!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Can you imagine that, fellas? Her name is
Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Her name is Nikki. She holds men’s teeth. She
sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boys, she’s gonna be a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, my, my!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Poor sweet! She can’t even hold her glass!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, well, HE can’t either. Besides, he has to
use two hands.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Course he can’t hold his glass. His hands are
burned.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Burned?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You have no right to spill YOUR drinks. He
can’t help himself.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Burned? How burned?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: He brought a plane down on fire.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: An airplane? In the war?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: He held the stick. But his hands began to
slip. Then he held it inside his arms. He was trying to bring his rear
gunner down alive.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did he bring him down safe?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Brought him down.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, so that’s why–?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yes! That’s why he can’t hold a glass.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, I’m so ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Now, Cary’s had a pretty thin time. His nerves
are tricky. You should never call attention to his hands.</p>
<p><strong>at a table</strong>: Cary sits with a fresh drink and is
trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless American
journalist – the unspeakable FRINK – enters and greets him casually.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hi, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, hello, Frink.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hello, Francis. Bill.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Shep. Drunk again?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Say, don’t you know any OTHER opening remarks?
It’s about all we’ve heard from you for a year.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hi! Jean!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Un sidecar.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Sidecar …</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Say, why don’t you fellows go home and go to
work?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Work? What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Oh, anything useful.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What could we do? Sell washing machines? Drive
a milk wagon? Mend old furniture or somethin’? Heh!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Go back to flying. Fly the air mails.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Aw, we couldn’t fly a kite.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Maybe a small kite.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Well, there must be something you can do.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: We’ve got to tend to our drinking. We don’t
get much opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Lots of things going on outside. Sun shining,
trees growing, people walking around.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say! Is that STILL going on?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sounds pretty pre-war to me.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hey. Don’t I rate an introduction? Who’s your
swell friend?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found scattered
around.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes away.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: who sits at his table, staring into space,
holding his unread menu in his lap.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: is pleased to see Cary.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh! He didn’t go.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, I’m so sorry. Your hands…</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor
hands.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: If you aren’t the WORST! First, you insult his
hands and make him mad. Then you cry over them and make him
self-conscious. Come on back here. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>the bar</strong>: Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep
guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them. Shep sits next to her as
she continues to sob. She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained
face.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, that’s torn it. He’ll never come back
now.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Then we’ll have to find him.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: To explain how sorry I am.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: We-ell. You don’t have to get so emotional
about it.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who’s getting emotional?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You are. You’re coming all apart. Here. Take a
drink of this. Make you laugh and play.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say, what’s she crying about?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: She’s crying on account of they didn’t wash
her strawberries this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Didn’t they wash your strawberries this
morning? Well, there ain’t a whole hell of a lot that we can do about
that now.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>another view</strong>: Frink watches suspiciously as Shep
pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! Where’re you goin’?!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Oh, out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Out where?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t you suppose you could arrange that
here?!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go
somewheres else to get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenue des champs �lys�es - later that night</strong>: A
taxi cab – filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink – pulls up
to a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a
sidewalk table.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! There he is!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>the sidewalk table</strong>: where Cary sits reading a
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say, what are you tryin’ to do, disown us?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hello. Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure we’ll sit down. What’d ya think we’d do?
Stand around?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hello, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have
to drink?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Martini!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Quatre Martinis?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Uh, could I have champagne, please?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Champagne? Oui.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boys, she’s goin’ to be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s what I started on. It upsets me if I
change over to anything else.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: There’s a lot of things wrong with this one.
What were you doing at the bar at Claridge’s anyway?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yes. Don’t you know you’re not supposed to be
there?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: There’s a sign on the wall says ladies must
sit at the back.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Can’t read signs.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, we’ll just have to take care of her,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Do you think she’s good-lookin’ enough?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, I know I’m not very good- looking
but–</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: But when I was a little girl, my mother
always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Then there’s her drinking.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What’s the matter with my drinking?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re a sissy drinker.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, maybe I can improve.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Then there’s her teeth. Why, one of ’em is
turned sideways.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You mean this one?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Why don’t you have it turned around?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I don’t have it turned around on account of
it’s a kind of help.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, in what respect does it kind of
help?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too
hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too
hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don’t let anyone kiss me
– hard.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, we’ll let that pass.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Where’s he gone?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep went off to sharpen his skates.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now, about your nose.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What about my nose?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It isn’t straight. It kind of turns up at the
end.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped
by a swing.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: How’d you happen to get bumped?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I just walked through the gate. I was only
seven.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, poor dear. Didn’t you see it?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I can’t see very far.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Did it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: It made me dizzy all day.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, I guess we can’t hold that against
her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We all make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right. Michelangelo painted Adam with a
navel.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: All the same, he’d look funny the other way –
even in a painting.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Where’s he gone?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He went off to shave a horse.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Have you got a husband or anything?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No husband.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: A mother?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Mother, yes. But we haven’t met in quite a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Why not in a long time?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, on account of my mother’s name was
Beulah. Now, you can’t have a mother named Beulah. So I changed it to
Jane. And that’s how it all began.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his
chair. He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his
jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The chiming ends and he rises without
a word and exits.</p>
<p><strong>at the table</strong>: Nikki watches Francis’ exit curiously.
Bill waves her off before she can ask:</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s goin’ off to tame an alligator.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who is he, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Francis used to fly with us in the 94th. The
best shot in the squadron. Brought down twelve planes. Used to call him
“Sudden Death.” He lost interest after his teammate got killed. He’s
lonesome is all.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I like him.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: He carries a chiming watch on account of he’s
always falling asleep in the daytime.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What kind of chimes?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and
Whittington.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll take vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think he’s a washout.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, just because you’re a big bombardier and
an All-American–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: All-American what?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Halfback.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or
Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn’t you never read
about Bill? Bronko Bill – the Alabama Flash?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I think it’s a forgery.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say! What do you want me to do? Tackle a
horse?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right, all right, I’ll tackle a horse.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Here comes one now.</p>
<p><strong>a horse-drawn cab</strong>: rolling down the street in their
direction.</p>
<p><strong>at the table</strong>: Everyone watches as Bill rises and
suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look out, horse!</p>
<p><strong>the horse-drawn cab</strong>: rolling along as Bill runs in
and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal’s front
legs to trip up the poor creature.</p>
<p><strong>on the sidewalk</strong>: Cary, horrified, stands and
yells:</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>at the horse-drawn cab</strong>: Cary rushes up to the
startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey! What’s the idea – runnin’ down my friend
like that? Here!</p>
<p><strong>wider view</strong>: of the fallen horse as the driver
descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to
its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Never mind. Look where you’re going in the
future now. You just watch out where you’re going!</p>
<p><strong>another view</strong>: Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and
tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and
shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. Bill hangs on and tries to
calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the
driver gather around. Bill is more interested in petting the horse which
understandably shies away from him.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Now listen, come on out here, you old fool.
Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nice horsie.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of
yourself. You old fool! You know what you’ll do? You’ll kill yourself
one of these days. Now, come on, get out of here. Now, listen–</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You all right now, brother?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: All right. Now, you just keep your horse, see?
You got your money.</p>
<p><strong>back at the sidewalk table</strong>: The waiter sets out a
fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily dusts off the
sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his seat.
They all sit down under the following:</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey, listen, Bill, you’re All- American, see?
You’re TWO All- Americans! The lady’s convinced you’re the whole team.
You don’t have to tackle any more horses. How ’bout that? Drink your
drink.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ahhh. Wasn’t that a great spill?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hey! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Would you all excuse me for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: To take a Chinese singing lesson.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: walks proudly into the restaurant as the men
cheer. A smiling maitre d’ directs her to the ladies’ room.</p>
<p><strong>back at the table</strong>: Frink watches Nikki disappear
from view and, after a glance at the others, rises and follows her.
Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and drinking. Bill
turns to Cary with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey. What kind of a girl do you think Nikki
is?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I think she’s the kind that sits down on
phonograph records.</p>
<p><strong>inside the restaurant</strong>: As Nikki returns from her
Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a wall, blocking her
way.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Say, Nikki, let’s ditch these drunks and go
off somewhere by ourselves. These crazy fools are liable to do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Since the war, they don’t care what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And do you?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I’ll say so. I’ve got more important things
to think of.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What more important things?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Well, my work.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I’m the foreign correspondent for a New York
newspaper syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: How nice for you!</p>
<p><strong>back at the sidewalk table</strong>: The men rise briefly as
Nikki rejoins them and sits.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that sits
down on phonograph records?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: People shouldn’t leave their records lying
about.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Take me dancing?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What place you wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What places you got?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, we got Maxim’s, only it’s too early.
We’ve got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal
Tabarin.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll take vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Somebody pay for the drinks!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’re off in a “billizzard” of
horse-radish!</p>
<p><strong>int. bal tabarin ball room - later that night</strong>: A
festive Parisian night spot. Dance MUSIC plays while a floor show, lit
by moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is
ringed with crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top
hat, whirls exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus
girls.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: My, my! Isn’t this nice?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now, listen, men. I’ll tell ya something
funny.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I was only four years old once.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Said he was only four years old once.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Said his aunt had on a very low-neck
dress.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And she sat right across the table in front of
me. And I said, “Auntie – I can see your knees!”</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I wonder what’s doing in Portugal tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe I’d better do my match trick.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: If you do match tricks, I’ll recite.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Recite what?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Poetry.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Whose poetry?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: My poetry.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You write poetry?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll send you a photograph of my poetry.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, I wonder if there’s anything intoxicating
in that.</p>
<p><strong>int. bal tabarin ball room - still later that night</strong>:
By now, a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - frink’s hand</strong>: strays to Nikki’s legs
and up her dress.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Nikki rises indignantly and turns on
Frink.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Just what ARE your plans?</p>
<p><strong>wider still</strong>: The other men seated at the table
understand instantly what’s going on and stare darkly at Frink.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You’ll have to watch that lad, Nikki. He’s a
member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good
time.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical,
indelicate and lousy. Have I made myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: All right. My mistake. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You’ll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He’s
just a licentious old man.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: It’s getting pretty late, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Do you want to go home, Nikki? I’ll take you
home. Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hotel Carlton.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll take her home, too.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: So will I!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: We’ll match to see who takes her home!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nothin’ doing! We’ll ALL take her home.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I saw her first.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It makes no difference. She belongs to us all
now!</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel carlton - lobby - later that night</strong>: The
group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says,
“Wheeee!” Others say, “Ssshhh!” They cross to the front desk.</p>
<p><strong>at the front desk</strong>: The clerk is fast asleep, his
head down on the desk. Nikki is about to wake him when Bill bounds
forward.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sh! Let him sleep. What’s your number?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Eighty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>in the hotel elevator</strong>: Amused, the group piles into
the “ascenseur”. Last one in is Bill who shuts the door and the metal
safety gate behind him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here we are. Goin’ up!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Who’s gonna pilot this craft?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll take her off. Where’s the throttle?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Got your safety belts buckled?</p>
<p><strong>shep &amp; others</strong>: Mm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here it is. Contact?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Contact!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’re off!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Shut her off!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hold her nose! She’s headed for the
hangar!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hey, stop it, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: We’ve gone an’ passed my floor.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Gone an’ passed your floor? I’ll fix that.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Put her tail down!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Bail out, boys! She’s gonna crash!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Wheeeee!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: We’ve gone an’ passed my floor again.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say! How do you stop this thing?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: That’s right, laugh.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: We should’ve brought our parachutes!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get a good hold, Millie. We’re off again.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nothing doing! Let Cary take the controls.
You’ll run us through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: All set?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hurray!</p>
<p><strong>shep &amp; francis</strong>: Hurray!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: There we are.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel hallway - fifth floor - minutes later - long
traveling shot</strong>: The elevator door opens. Cary leads the way as
everyone else spills out happily into the hall. Shep puts a
congratulatory arm around Cary.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Say! That’s a pilot for ya.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You deserve a medal.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right, come on, men.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I need a rest, I need a rest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s hotel suite - sitting room -
continuous</strong>: Laughing, the group files into the darkened room
and spreads out.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Wheeeee!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, for–! Well, I’ll be a–! Look! Nikki’s
got a whole apartment!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: And a gramophone!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Yeah! And chairs and tables and floors and
ceilings and everything.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: So THIS is where Nikki lives!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes, this is where Nikki lives.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: And she’s got a book!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Got all the comforts of home.</p>
<p><strong>perfume bottles</strong>: on Nikki’s glass-topped dressing
table – dozens of them.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! Look at all the bottles!</p>
<p><strong>nikki’s bedroom</strong>: as the other four men respond to
Bill’s enthusiastic summons and enter.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki’s
bottles!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ylang! Ylang!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey, don’t be handlin’ her things. Put ’em
down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Chichi!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Leave ’em alone.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale! Jinko!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hey, you big bombardier–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Chiki chiki!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Say, I never saw so many shoes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She never winds her clock! It says eleven and
I’ve never been anywheres at eleven.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What time are you anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Two o’clock. It’s always two o’clock in my
life. Hey, listen. Besides never having any matches and always spilling
her drinks, she never winds her clock! Think I’ll go in the bathroom and
see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is it all right?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hello, yourself.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Turtles?</p>
<p><strong>high angle shot - two turtles</strong>: swimming in shallow
water at the bottom of a bathtub. A couple of decorative lily pads lie
next to the drain. The turtles’ shells are inlayed with brilliants.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom</strong>: Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep,
Francis and Cary join him. Bill points out his discovery to the
others.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Turtles!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Turtles?!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: It IS turtles!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hey! Look, Cary! It’s turtles!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nice work, boys. It’s turtles.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom doorway</strong>: Nikki enters and addresses the
men.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And now do you suppose you could all excuse
me?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: On account of I’d like to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Sure we’ll excuse you. I’ll clear everybody
out of here. Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>at the bathtub</strong>: The other men, still lined up at the
tub enjoying the turtles, are disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Awww! Bed?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yup, all right.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So long, turtles.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good night, turtles.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Night, turtles.</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot - through the suite</strong>: The entire group
exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into the
sitting room.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Mm hm.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, good night.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nighty-night, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Good night, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>sitting room</strong>: Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and
tosses it across the room. He proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa,
fall on his back with his feet in the air, then stretch his legs out
across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>at the bedroom door</strong>: Nikki and Cary stand close,
exchanging warm goodnights.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Good night, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Good night, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>low angle shot - sitting room</strong>: Four men, happily
situated, settling in for a night’s sleep: Bill and Shep on the sofa,
Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table.
Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs
and yawning as only a narcoleptic can.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say! I like this place.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Say, I like this place, too.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I think it’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: peers at them skeptically, hands on his
hips.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You fellas think you’re gonna PARK here?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a
bottle of eau de Cologne and some towels.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Will somebody please scrub my back?</p>
<p><strong>low angle shot - sitting room</strong>: Excited again, Bill
jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Will somebody scrub your back?! Look out,
boys!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: holds the bottle in her hand. The men’s hands
reach for it but Bill is quicker than the others and commandeers it with
authority.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I got it, I got it, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: now seated, watches this coolly as he takes
out a cigarette and lights it.</p>
<p><strong>bill and nikki</strong>: Bill examines Nikki’s back with
delight.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mmmmmm mm!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Scrub hard.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did anyone ever see such a back in their
life?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did anyone ever HEAR of such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>shep, frink and francis</strong>: watch all this with envy
and interest.</p>
<p><strong>bill and nikki</strong>: Bill keeps scrubbing, adopting the
air of a professional back scrubber.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Harder.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My, my!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I could go on doin’ this a long time.</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot - sitting room</strong>: We start on Cary, who
sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching Bill and Nikki with
amusement. After a pause:</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki? Are you rich?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, practically. Beulah is rich.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, just how rich IS your mother?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Leave a lady a few secrets, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Thank you, William. That was EVER so cool and
nice. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>the men</strong>: Good night, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on, fellas!</p>
<p><strong>sitting room - another view</strong>: Bill and Shep carry the
sofa over and place it directly in front of Nikki’s closed bedroom door.
Francis brings his rug and pillow.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: watches them, amused, from the front door.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You’re gonna stay here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sitting room - another view</strong>: The men settle in for
the night.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s right! She might need some more
help!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front
door and exits the darkened room, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>int. carlton bar - next morning</strong>: The drinking hole
in Nikki’s hotel. A French woman noisily arranges dirty drinking glasses
as Bill, Francis and Shep enter – horribly hungover, moaning and yawning
– and line up at the bar. A bartender greets them to take their
order.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Messieurs.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Um, prairie oyster.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Prairie oyster.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Prairie oyster.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Prairie oyster for three.</p>
<p><strong>carlton bar - another view</strong>: We start on a CLOSE SHOT
of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one.
Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy. We
PAN OVER to the three men:</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Say, we’d better get back to our hotel.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: There’s no Nikki at our hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: And the bar doesn’t open so early.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say! Why don’t we move in here?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Sure. Let’s stay here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But - what about Cary?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What about Cary?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What ABOUT Cary?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We can move him in, too.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Not a bad idea!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, come on, men. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s suite - later that day</strong>: Phonograph
music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel’s specialist in Chinois
Pedicure, paints Nikki’s toenails. We PAN UP to discover Nikki wearing a
robe, sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and
checking on the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Entrez!</p>
<p><strong>the front door</strong>: opens and Bill, looking dapper,
enters.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hi, Nik!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hello, Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Good morning, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Morning, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I didn’t expect to see you all so early.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We camped on your doorsteps last night. And
this morning we all moved in.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Despite your practically innumerable faults,
we adore you. We’ve decided to adopt you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, for heaven’s sakes! Look at Nikki! What
are you having done to yourself, gal?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Whatcha having your toes painted for,
Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I don’t know. Seemed like a good idea at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why, look at Nikki’s legs, would you? That
there is practically the loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in all my
born days.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Like my legs?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Look at those legs, Cary. My, they nearly
match.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Did you ever see such a swell set of legs?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, what do you want me to do about it?
Burst into tears?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to
burst into tears?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: On account of my legs? Oh! I think that would
be sweet.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Here, Nikki, drink this.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Make you laugh and play.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s what I want to do, laugh and play.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here’s to Nikki’s dainty legs. As smooth and
hairless as an egg.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Wheee!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hurray!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: ’Ray!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well! Here comes that licentious old man. Who
invited him?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Still drinking?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Morning, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, it’s you. Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Say, I don’t think Nikki likes you.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Oh, no?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: No. What do you wanna hang around for?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Well, what do YOU hang around for?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some posies.
I’ll bet you didn’t bring Nikki any posies.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I– Well–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Cure the shakes.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I haven’t got the shakes.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Let’s see. Hold out your hands.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No, turn them over.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, that’s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Let’s see if you can hold this.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Steady as a rock!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, I guess that’ll keep his hands out of
mischief for a while.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hey. Take these off.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Now, let’s see. Where were we before we were
so rudely interrupted?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We were talkin’ about Nikki’s legs.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right. We were talkin’ about Nikki’s
legs. And havin’ a fine time, too.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Finis.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let’s inspect the job.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, my poor toes. Don’t look too close.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, what’s the matter with your toes?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well… when I was a little girl…</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: … my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. …
And they were WAY too short. …</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: … And I had to walk all the way to Sunday
school and back. … Down the road. … And it was hot and dusty.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, take her away! She’s breakin’ my
heart!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And when I got home … my toes were
spoiled.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, dear, oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s such a sad story. Let’s all have a
drink, quick!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And now would you all excuse me? On account
of I’m gonna put on a dress.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, why not?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: My, my. What’s HE getting so excited
about?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: You guys think you’re so darn smart.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, cheerio, fellas. I’m off.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, on account of it’s raining and
everything, we thought we’d go over to the Cluny and play billiards and
drink beer.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Went to get his hat and coat. He’s going to
P�re Lachaise.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: A cemetery. How ’bout you coming with us?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You’ve been invited?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Do you think Cary might object?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, I have an idea he’d like to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why alone?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, Cary likes to be alone. He’s as brittle
as a breadstick. One silly crack from you and he might break up in
sections.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, then, I don’t think he should be left
alone. Tell me, what’s Cary doing in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What are we all doing in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I know. But why doesn’t he go home?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, he’s not ready to go home. What could he
do if he went home? Have people cry over his hands?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this.
He’s such a sweet soul.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: One of the best.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Isn’t he just sort of wasting himself?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: On the contrary. He’s trying awfully hard to
get hold of himself.</p>
<p><strong>the front door</strong>: Shep stops Nikki from leaving. She’s
a little downcast as he admonishes her:</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Now, listen. If you tag along, for heaven’s
sake, be careful what you say. Don’t start getting sorry for him and
don’t cry over him. And, above all, don’t make any unfortunate remarks,
hear?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, I won’t. Why, who ever heard of such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>the hallway</strong>: where Cary – carrying coat, hat and
cane – emerges from a suite across the hall from Nikki’s and heads for
the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki calling to him. She runs to
join him.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cary?! Cary? I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oooh! Ooh, wait for Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>the front door</strong>: of her suite where Shep still
stands. He watches with surprise as Nikki runs in.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Wait for Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>her bedroom closet</strong>: Nikki draws the curtain to
reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes. Shep, drink in
hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches
Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair
of red ones.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What are you changing your shoes for?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: On account of I can walk faster in red
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenue casimir-perier - later that day</strong>:
Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a
sidewalk caf� – LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the
little iron tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as
Nikki hurries under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the
driver , looks at the rain.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Perhaps we’d better stay here a while till it
clears up.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Could we sit down here, do you suppose?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I think so. Would you like something to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What should I drink now, do you suppose?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Deux picon citrons.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Picon citrons?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Very refreshing. Make you laugh and play.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s what you always promise. Cary, why
does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Don’t we all?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Not like Shep.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you
know. Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: But isn’t there some kind of treatment or
something?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep could never stand a long course of
treatment. Drinking’s the only corrective so far as he’s concerned. He’s
found out the tic doesn’t work when he’s tight. So he stays tight.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Seems such a pity. How did he get the
tic?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: In the war.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I know. But how?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, it’s not very romantic.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, don’t tell me if you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Lice under his bandages.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: He had the devil of a time. He nearly lost his
mind. So you’ll have to excuse him a little.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’m so sorry for Shep.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, don’t let him know it.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, isn’t he going home? Not ever?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Not ever. Not in his dark glasses anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Can’t something be done for him?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: He’ll have to be - reborn.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: How’s he going to end?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, how are you going to end? How am I going
to end? How is ANYONE going to end? How’s your picon citron go?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: It goes fine. But doesn’t ANYTHING make any
difference to you?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Not now. A long time ago, perhaps, when I was
a little boy.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tell me, where were you little?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: In Minnesota. On a farm.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Were you happy then, Cary?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tell me, what WAS there to be happy about on
a farm in Minnesota?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom. The smell
of burning leaves in the fall. The sound of horses’ hoofs on the road.
Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field
mice? Or explore old trunks in an attic? Listen to the moaning of the
telephone wires in the winter wind? See a gypsy caravan?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: So THAT’S why you were happy. On account of
apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and
old trunks and things?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: But aren’t you going back? Not ever?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Would you like another picon citron before you
go? The rain is lifting.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No. I’m ready now.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cemetery - late that afternoon</strong>: Cary and Nikki
stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around. The rain has stopped.
They are the only living people in the ancient cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who all is buried here?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, poets, painters, philosophers–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cocoanut?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No cocoanut. Poets, painters, philosophers,
musicians.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: There’s Chopin.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, I practiced him.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And there’s Balzac. And there’s H�lo�se and
Ab�lard.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, tell me about Ab�lise and �loard.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No, Nikki. Not Ab�lise and �loard. H�lo�se and
Ab�lard.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’m sorry. I really didn’t do it on purpose.
It was on account of the picon citron. Tell me about H�lo�se and
Ab�lard.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, they’re buried here in the same
sepulchre side by side.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why are they buried side by side?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: They were the world’s most famous lovers.
There’s the tomb.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tell me about the world’s most famous
lovers.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, Ab�lard was a scholastic
philosopher–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Whatever that is.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Whatever that is. He gained a footing in a
certain household as tutor to a maiden called H�lo�se. And employed his
unlimited opportunities for the purpose of– Well, betrayal. Not,
however, unmixed with real love. He carried her off to Brittany.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, her uncle was furious. He blamed Ab�lard
for the whole thing. He conceived a terrible revenge.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’m afraid for Ab�lard.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: He broke into Ab�lard’s apartment one night
and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: The lovers were forced to live their lives
apart. But when they died, they were buried here side by side. There’s a
story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the
tomb.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Heart-shaped stones?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And lovers come and find them and exchange
them with each other. And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb
of H�lo�se and Ab�lard, no harm can come to your true love.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: How perfectly beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Isn’t that a quaint legend?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Do you think I might find a heart- shaped
stone? You help me, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: All right, Nikki. Only we have to leave soon.
They close up the place.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Just as soon as we find our stones.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I found one! Where’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>nikki and cary’s hands</strong>: as the couple sits near the
tomb. They show each other the stones in their upturned hands. Nikki
takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it in Cary’s
stiff, weathered hand. Then she transfers his stone to her hand.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And, now, you take mine. And I’ll take
yours.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Isn’t that the way the story goes?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And, now, no harm can come to our true
love.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And, now, we’ll have to go.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You were so nice to let me come with you. I
spoiled your whole day. You were going to do something else, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you come
here today?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: To pay my respects to an old comrade.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I’m sorry.
Oh, I’m so sorry. Don’t pay any attention to me, Cary. I can’t help it.
You MAKE me cry.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, don’t look so troubled, Cary. I’m all
right. I just want to cry for a minute. On account of you’re so nice.
You’re so clean, Cary. And your teeth are so white. You’re so civilized.
You don’t care about anything any more, nor anybody. Nothing makes any
difference to you. Nothing can touch you. Why, you’re lost. You’re ALL
lost. You and Shep and the rest of you. Oh, I want to do something for
you. I want to help you. Let me wash your bracelet, Cary. Why, see? The
silver’s all tarnished. The silver’s all tarnished. I’ll take it with me
and scrub it when I get home. I’ll polish it with my nail-brush.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: It’s getting dark.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well … Anyway, we found a name for my
turtles!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: H�lo�se and Ab�lard? A name for your turtles?
So that’s what you were looking for. I might have known how it would
end.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s bedroom - that night</strong>: Nikki sits,
soberly polishing Cary’s bracelet with her nail brush. Shep enters,
drink in hand.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hi, Nik.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Cary’s in a state. Says he’s going away. Can’t
stand it any longer and all that sort of thing. What happened between
you two, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cary seemed so sad and everything – on
account of I’d taken up his whole afternoon. So little Nikki said, all
merry and bright, “Well, anyway, we’d found a name for my turtles.”</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: A name for the turtles?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s funny!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Name for the turtles! That’s so funny, all
right!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Why do you always HAVE to be funny at the
wrong time? Didn’t I tell you Cary was brittle? How did he respond to
THAT line?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Pulled down the iron curtain.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did he say he was going away?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yup. Gotta get away from it all.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Then, you’ve got to go to him right now!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And explain that I didn’t mean it! Tell him
how it was and everything!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No, go on. You go right now before it’s too
late!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: But Nikki–!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You go right straight to Cary.</p>
<p><strong>int. cary’s room - later</strong>: Cary removes clothes from
a rack as a now serious Shep, drink in hand, stands nearby trying to
reason with him.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Now, listen, Cary, you don’t have to behave
like an old Easter egg. You’re breaking Nikki’s heart. She doesn’t know
any better.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: She doesn’t know any better? Well, whether she
does or not, I’m going a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki and her
turtles.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Whew! You sure are in an uproar. What YOU need
is a drink!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I need more than a drink. I need a lot of
geography between me and that girl.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Where do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Anywheres. So long as it’s a long way from
Nikki. You know – that girl does things to me. I’ve got to get away.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, I wonder what’s happening in Portugal
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say … I wonder what IS happening in Portugal
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s suite - late that night</strong>: Bill and Shep
set a large steamer trunk upright.</p>
<p><strong>bill and shep</strong>: Heave ho!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ah! There you go.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: If Cary’s going to Portugal, why can’t we go
to Portugal, too? Ain’t we got any rights?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure we got rights!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Cary better not think he can screw up in
Portugal and leave old Shep behind.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Say, when’s he leaving?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud Express.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Don’t we have to have passports and
things?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sure we gotta have passports!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What kind passports you like?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What kind passports you got?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry
passports.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll take vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Good night, Nikki. I’ll see you on the
train.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You’re goin’, too?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Why not? I might, uh, pick up a couple of
features for my paper - in Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nikki, do you want –?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did you put all my shoes in?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You bet. There they are–</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I don’t know how you’re going to get all these
dresses in, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s suite - next morning</strong>: A mountain of
trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down near Shep
who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Don’t we have to go like anything? The train
leaves in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Are you SURE you have everything?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I - I think so.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hardly seems enough.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, my turtles! My turtles!</p>
<p><strong>the turtles</strong>: are plucked from the tub and placed in
…</p>
<p><strong>… a basket</strong>: by Nikki’s little Asian maid. The fancy
beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather
improbable turtle carrier. Bill secures a wire mesh covering over the
basket and carries it out of the bathroom, handing it grandly to
Francis.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here you are, Francis! You’re the custodian of
the turtles! Now don’t fall down on the job.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hey! I never tended turtles before.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Now, all you have to do -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: - is to sprinkle ’em now and then, like
this.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Oh, yeah. I see.</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: Five bellhops march in and, under
the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed to carry off the luggage,
chattering in French.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, we’re off. Be careful of that one.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, come on, Francis! Take those turtles!</p>
<p><strong>ext. train station - later that morning</strong>: A whistle
BLOWS. Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill walk
down the platform, parallel to the train. Bill claps his hands
exuberantly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There she is, boys! The Sud Express!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Can you imagine Cary tryin’ to run away and
leave us behind?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Do you suppose he’s really gonna be here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure he’ll be here. He’s never missed a train
in his life.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Say, do you suppose the turtles’ll be all
right with that porter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Aw, sure they’ll be all right. All you got to
do is - - sprinkle ’em!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>farther down the platform</strong>: Cary buys a paper from a
newsboy and steps onto his train.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hello, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, hello. What are you all doing down
here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We just came down to see you off is all.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, that’s darn decent of you.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Ya got a nice seat?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Yeah, right by a window.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, how nice for you!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on! Show us your seat by the window!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE that seat by
the window.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Come on, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>int. cary’s compartment - a moment later</strong>: The group
crowds into the small compartment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My, my, what a swell train.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say, I wonder if a
chap can get a drink on this train.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure! I don’t see why not. Push the
button.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, I’m afraid you won’t have time for a
drink. We’re gonna start in a minute. You’ll have to get off.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this train!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: This is a Train de Luxe.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yes, we like trains de luxe, don’t we,
Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey! He’s blowing the whistle. Hey, we’re
gonna start.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, let her start.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Let ’er go Gallagher. Who cares?!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Who cares?!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Who cares?!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who cares?!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Hello, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And you, too?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right. Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Goodbye! Goodbye! Don’t forget to write!</p>
<p><strong>the train’s wheels</strong>: racing down the track.</p>
<p><strong>int. cary’s compartment - in the heat of the
evening</strong>: The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing.
Bill – drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off – appears in
the doorway, coming from the train’s corridor.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hi, men! Look what I found.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Ah, thank you, no, not I.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: I - I say, are you all going to
Portugal?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Yup. We’re going down there to investigate
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Investigate conditions?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Drinking conditions, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: By the way, what ARE conditions?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Don’t you know what conditions are?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: No. Never saw one in my life.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The drinking conditions are pretty bad right
here.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Ahh, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My beer’s full of cinders.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki? The man says your compartment’s
ready.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’m glad – on account of it’s been so hot and
I’m so tired and I want to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Going to bed? Who ever heard of such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can we help you undress?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No, thank you, William.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Take off your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Undo your hair?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Scrub your back or something?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No, I can manage quite well by myself. Good
night, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Good night, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop?
She wouldn’t let them help her undress.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Can’t understand it at all.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You know, she’s not very pretty. But when she
was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest
hair-ribbons.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Indeed?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: She got one tooth turned around, she can’t see
very far, and she’s ALWAYS speaking out of turn. Otherwise, she’s a
mighty fine piece of architecture.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Mm, seems to need a few repairs.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: She’s got eyes like an Assyrian Queen’s got
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You ain’t never seen no Assyrian Queen! You’re
just a-makin’ that up outta yore own head!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: In whose green hat?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: In the Metropolitan Museum’s green hat, that’s
whose green hat.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hold on there! Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. You’re on a
train.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You go back to your turtles, hear? You’ve been
neglecting your assignment.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Sprinkle the turtles?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Cool ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Turtles get feverish on trains.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Ahh! Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>nikki’s voice</strong>: Cary!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki!</p>
<p><strong>nikki’s voice</strong>: Cary! Bill! Shep!</p>
<p><strong>int. nikki’s compartment - a moment later</strong>: Frink
grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she
struggles to free herself from his grasp.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cary!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Say!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, what’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: What’s the idea? Well, what business is that
of yours?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki, you all right? What is this tough
trying to do to you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, I was just going to bed and he came in
and flang himself all over me.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Frink, you’d better get out of here right away
before something happens to you.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: What right have you to tell me to get out of
here? This isn’t your compartment, is it?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it. If you
don’t clear out of here right now, you’re liable to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: All right. Suppose you put me out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Put him out? I’ll snap his spine and throw him
off the train!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hold everything, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like
this?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I’m not gonna let these silly drunks tell ME
where to get off.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Silly drunks?!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Silly drunks, did you say?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Yes. And that goes for the whole bunch of
you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Let me have him.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: You will, eh?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Socko!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, dear!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mm! Now, ain’t that nice? Have you ever seen
anything so cute?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Will you be all right now, Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Grab hold of that fella and drag him out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come to papa.</p>
<p><strong>int. cary’s compartment - a moment later</strong>: Francis
sits by the window, rubbing his head. Cary arrives and sits down next to
him. Cary takes Francis’ water bottle and hands it to him.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Here, Francis. Do your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Frink, don’t you know better than to try a
stunt like that?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Oh, I - I lost my head over the girl is all.
I’m sorry. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, you apologize to Nikki in the morning.
And don’t you ever get out of line again. The next time, it might be
different.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lisbon, portugal - day</strong>: Crowded city street. A
superimposed title reads: LISBON</p>
<p><strong>lisbon night montage</strong>: Cocktail shaker in the hands
of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as appropriate Latin MUSIC
begins. This DISSOLVES TO a kaleidoscopic VIEW of our protagonists
enjoying the night life: Nikki’s image dominates at the center,
surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. Everyone drinks,
except Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike,
presumably at Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>int. cary and shep’s hotel room - day</strong>: Cary, wearing
a robe, sees Shep still asleep in bed. Cary puts on a party hat, sits on
the edge of his own bed opposite Shep’s, picks up a party horn and blows
into it, hard. The horn SQUEALS horribly. Shep wakes with a start and
sits up in bed, completely unnerved. Cary laughs at him and, with his
clenched hands, picks up a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Wake up, ya big sissy. Here, drink this. It’ll
make you laugh and play like any old thing.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Say, Cary, what day is this?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: It’s Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Wednesday? Wednesday what?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: The twentieth.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What month, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You mean to say you don’t know what month this
is?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I knew once but I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, it’s June. The merry month of June.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: June? Say, maybe I better get up.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What town are we in?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You’re in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Lisbon. That’s where I thought it was. I just
wanted to check up is all.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, what’s the matter with you, Shep? Don’t
you really know where you are or what day it is?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I kind of lose track of things.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Say, this is getting serious.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Serious? Is anything serious any more?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, it’s serious when you don’t know where
you’re at. What’s gonna become of you?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Oh, I’ll be all right when I’ve had a couple
of drinks. Say, what town did you say this was?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, now, pull
yourself together, Shep. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Bull-fight? Are we going to a bull-fight?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Is that guy Frink coming along?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: ’Fraid so.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Gee, isn’t there any way we can get rid of
that guy?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Somebody’ll have to shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Not a bad idea at that.</p>
<p><strong>ext. arena - day</strong>: A bugler blows his own horn,
grandly, while standing before colorful bull- fight posters that read:
CORRIDA DE TOUROS</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Praca de Touros!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I wonder if there’s a bar inside or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Sure, there IS a bar.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let’s find the bar. We gotta get organized for
the bull-fight.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>int. the bar - minutes later</strong>: Led by their guide,
Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, extremely
drunken old man is the only other customer.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya? Isn’t that
a beautiful thing?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What are you all gonna have?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Beer is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Cinco cervejas.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Cinco cervejas.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I don’t like beer.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Make you leap like a tuna.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Don’t wanna leap like a tuna.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Make you bark like a fox.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Don’t wanna bark like a fox.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Make you laugh and play.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s what I wanna do! Laugh and play!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey! Vermouth!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, men, fire and fall back!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey! What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I hope I don’t catch a cold in my left
ear.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Hey, drink your drinks! We’ll miss the
parade!</p>
<p><strong>ext. arena - minutes later</strong>: The crowd CHEERS and the
band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters
the ring.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well! My old pal!</p>
<p><strong>in the ring</strong>: The parade ends. A matador throws his
montera into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>in the front row</strong>: Cary catches the hat, much to the
group’s delight – they shout “Hooray!” Immediately, a cape is hurled at
Bill who drapes it over the railing before them. Cary offers the hat to
Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Nikki, here’s a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, a hat!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Oh, se�or, no, no, no – you must not keep the
hat. You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador
after the fight.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What kind of present?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Well, eh - a little jewelry. Something you
have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or
the cuff links or - or the–</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Vanilla?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Yes! Vanilla!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look! Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>in the ring</strong>: A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter
and bull face off. The bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each
time.</p>
<p><strong>in the front row</strong>: Bill sits next to Pedro.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Nice work! Good work.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s so good about it?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: He works close to the bull.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is that so dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Sure, it’s dangerous. Bull-fighting is very
dangerous. It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Is it true the bull is blind when he
charges?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: He sees only the cape – perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>in the ring</strong>: Bull-fighter and bull continue their
duel. Finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to
distract the bull.</p>
<p><strong>in the front row</strong>: Bill is unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. You
know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: You should have started at twelve years of
old.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I bet I could start right now.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Sit still and behave yourself.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Bull-fighting is not for Americans.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You think we haven’t got the nerve or
something?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Why, listen, bull-fighting is just for us,
the Latins.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He thinks we’re a-scared!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: He tackled a horse once.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Tackle a horse?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Is not the same!</p>
<p><strong>in the ring</strong>: the bull knocks down the matador.
Others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild, out of control.</p>
<p><strong>in the front row</strong>: Frink nudges Francis awake and
points out the carnage in the ring. Francis glances at the spectacle
briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a look and nudges
him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>wild bull montage</strong>: The toreros try to control the
bull but it refuses to cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!</p>
<p><strong>cary’s voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Bill! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Take it easy! Take it easy!</p>
<p><strong>int. arena infirmary - minutes later</strong>: A group of
toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to
reveal Cary standing over a bloodied Bill and holding his hand as
medical personnel prepare to operate. Bill lies flat on a table and
smiles, amused with himself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Cary? I slipped.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Too bad. You were doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wasn’t I, though? Heh. It’s a cinch.
Bull-fighting? Just as easy–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know why I slipped, Cary?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No, Bill. Why?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: On account of that beer in my shoe.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Doc!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Cary, that bull certainly was hostile.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You hurt, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You all right, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure. I’m all right. I was a big success.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: He wants that we should go right away.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m sure glad that I - I wore my new blue
shorts. I’ll be a big success in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll send you my turtles, Bill. And THEN
you’ll be a big success.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So long, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Goodbye, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: See ya later - Cary.</p>
<p><strong>ext. arena - moments later</strong>: Cary emerges and joins
the group who are gathered glumly on some steps.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: They’ve just put him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Why, thank you, Nikki. There’s nothing you can
do. You’d better go back to the hotel. Put Nikki in a taxi. We’ll wait
here.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Se�or, the reporters want to know why your
friend descend into the bull ring.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Tell them – that it seemed like a good idea -
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. carnival - night</strong>: The amusement park at Port
Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with appropriate MUSIC.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Sounds like old times.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let’s go and shoot.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Not a bad idea. What say, Annie Oakley? Like
to fire off a gun at something?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No objection.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: We’ll be right back. Hold everything.</p>
<p><strong>the shooting gallery</strong>: where an assortment of rifles
and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep escort Nikki to the
arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An attendant joins
them to collect their money and ready their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: First one to miss pays for the drinks.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What’ll we shoot at?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Shoot one of those pussycats and see what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: All right. Look out, pussycat.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Well, that’s what I was aiming at, a clay
pipe. Whole thing’s been misrepresented to me.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cary, let’s see you shoot something.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Look out, ball!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What’d YOU aim at?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Well, let’s see you shoot something.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: How do you hold it still?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Listen, Nikki, on your right shoulder. Now,
put your hand out there and hold up– No, don’t cover up the site. No,
no, no, that’s right. Now just hold it evenly–</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: You can do better than that. Show him up.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: What are you waving at, Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Look out! Why, you fool. Don’t you know better
than that?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Take your hands off me.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Put down that gun!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Let go of my wrist!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Put down that gun!</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Listen, you keep your hands off me! I’ve had
enough from you! You try any more of your rough stuff on me–!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, so that’s how it is. I thought we taught
you how to behave.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: You taught ME how to behave?! Listen, you’d
better behave now or you’ll get hurt!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: I don’t think so. I’ll give you three to put
down that gun. It’ll be just too bad if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Too bad for who?!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: One …</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: Keep away from me! I’ll shoot, I tell ya!
I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Two …</p>
<p><strong>frink</strong>: I’ll shoot! I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>cary’s voice</strong>: Francis?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Francis?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Goodbye, Cary.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Shep. Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here. Come on, Shep.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>behind the carnival buildings</strong>: on a dark, deserted
street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. Under the
light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls
casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope,
pausing to glance backward. He sees …</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s the last of Francis, I’m afraid. We’ll
never see him again.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did you notice his eyes? That’s the first
time I ever saw Francis really happy. What’ll happen to him, do you
suppose?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Don’t worry about, Francis. He’ll take care of
himself. Let’s get out of here. Let’s walk.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: No. Don’t want to walk. Let’s take a cab.</p>
<p><strong>the back seat of the taxi cab - moments later</strong>: As
the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the
crowded carnival, the MUSIC continues. Cary and Shep sit on either side
of Nikki. Cary is as edgy as Shep is subdued.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Did you see the way Francis poured lead into
that fellow?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Fast work.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Fast? Chain lightning!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nice shooting.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Those slugs went right past my ear. If I’d’ve
moved an inch, I would’ve caught one of them myself.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: “Sudden Death,” all right.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What’s the matter with you, Shep? I’ve never
known you so quiet before.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s right. I am kind of quiet.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Not smoking?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Your lighter working?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Good ol’, Nikki – never has any matches.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sure you want a light?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s what I want, a light.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Shep. Shep!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Shep’s hurt!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: It’s a forgery.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Do something for him, Cary! Oh, Shepard!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: He’s been shot!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What can we do, Cary?! What can we do?!</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep, why didn’t you say you were hurt?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may not
believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Oh, Shep, Shep, don’t say that. You’ll be all
right. We’ll get you to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: No, no, Cary. Don’t rush me anywheres. Let’s
sit here for a while. The– Hurts, the jolting.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s better. You know, Cary, I feel - just
like we’re falling – long time ago. Do you remember? Spinning … spinning
… spinning. Only you brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good old Cary. Best
flyer in the service.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: We’re gonna make a safe landing again,
Shep.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Not this time, Cary. Ol’ Shep’s gonna crash.
Say, but we’re spinning fast. Level off. Cary, level off.</p>
<p><strong>nikki’s voice</strong>: Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!</p>
<p><strong>ext. train wheels</strong>: ROAR down a railroad track.</p>
<p><strong>int. train compartment - night</strong>: Nikki cranks her
portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record –
Toselli’s “Serenade,” that strange, sad composition that haunted Europe
at the close of the Great War.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What are you writing, Cary?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: A letter. A letter to Shep’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Mind if I read it?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why, Cary. Cary, that’s the most beautiful
letter I’ve ever read.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Please forgive me for crying, Cary. I can’t
help it. You don’t mind if I cry just a minute, do you?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Can’t you cry, Cary?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: But you have cried sometime in your life,
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Long, long time ago. Before the war.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And you can’t cry now? Not even for Shep?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Shep Lambert spent his life in the war. He had
nothing more to give. He had died once. And he was ready to die
again.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: This time he was played out with music. That
was the way he wanted it.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: And Bill Talbot was a big success in the
hospital in his new blue shorts. Maybe he’ll tackle the angel Gabriel
and - be a big success again.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And Francis?</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming
watch one day and go on sleeping. Till the end. It doesn’t matter now.
Without them, nothing matters. We only had each other. Comradeship was
all we had left. And now that’s gone, too.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And you, Cary? You? You’re alone now.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: That’s right. I’m alone now.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I don’t want you to be alone, Cary. Let me
stay with you. Let me be with you.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Why, Nikki. You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>cary</strong>: Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn’t
forget.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No harm can come to our true love.</p>

<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, I’ve always wanted a pair of Spanish
earrings.</p>
