<p><strong>reverend larry</strong>: Occasionally we get a letter from a
viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your
television set is because he wants your money. And do you know what?
They’re right! I do want your money. Because god wants your money. So I
want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me
your money. You don’t need that car.</p>
<p><strong>otto mom</strong>: Put it on a plate son you’ll enjoy it
more.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I couldn’t enjoy it any more mom MMM MMM MMM
This is swell.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Dad? Hey Dad?</p>
<p><strong>otto dad</strong>: What is it son?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Do you remember that you once told me along
time ago. Well not too long ago but ummm. That you told me that you’d
give me a thousand dollars to go to Europe if I finish school. Well you
know something? You were right. About finishing school that’s ah that’s
what I’d like to do. But umm I want to know if I could have the money
first. Like now.</p>
<p><strong>otto dad</strong>: I don’t have it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What?]</p>
<p><strong>otto mom</strong>: You father gave all our extra money to the
Reverend’s telethon, Otto.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well what about me?</p>
<p><strong>otto dad</strong>: You’re on the honor roll of the chariots
of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a gift. From all of us jointly.</p>
<p><strong>otto mom</strong>: We’re sending bibles to El Salvador.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a
car.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Paid? You don’t get paid. Are you kidding, you
work on commission, that’s better than getting paid.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Most cars you rip are worth two or three
hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche might make ya five
grand.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It helps if you dress like a detective, too.
Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They’re
going to think you’re packing something. They don’t fuck with you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Am I what?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Packin’ something.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ha. Only an asshole gets killed for a car. Guys
who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at
three A.M. get up at four. That’s why there ain’t a repo man I know that
don’t take speed.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Speed huh?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’ll call you back! Flippin general
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p>**[bud snorting a line**: Jesus Christ.]</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car.
Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle
nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle
or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That’s what I call the
repo code kid. Don’t forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people
got a code to live by anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes
over there.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ordinary people I hate ’em.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What do you know? See an ordinary person spend
his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into
tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of
them a day and it don’t mean shit anymore. I mean I seen men stabbed and
it didn’t mean shit . I’ve seen guns. Guns too they don’t mean shit but
that’s when you got to watch your self. Here I’ll handle it pal. Uh
settle down.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it
doesn’t mean shit .</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Wasn’t that Otto?</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: Otto who?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You gotta watch yourself. Have a nice day . .
. night.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer
don’t have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be
sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it
away. Once you’ve got this baby on the hooks, she’s all ours.</p>
<p><strong>pakman</strong>: Oh no you don’t. I’m nipping this in the bud
right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There
is absolutely no way you’re going to take it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?</p>
<p><strong>pakman</strong>: Obviously not. I’m Arthur Pakman. Luann is
my daughter. Now you’re going to have to take this matter up with
her.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well don’t think I haven’t tried, sir, but she
hasn’t had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I’ve skipped trace
this car all over town.</p>
<p><strong>pakman</strong>: Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car
isn’t working anyway, and I know, I know that’s why she hasn’t paid
you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, she could have called us? Look, all
you’ve go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he
says.</p>
<p><strong>pakman reading card</strong>: I. G. Farben. . . What do you
take me for, a moron? If I go in there, you’re going to take this car
away.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What, and lose my job? The law requires that I
stay right here until you call my branch manager.</p>
<p><strong>pakman</strong>: That’s the law?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>pakman</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: There’s going to be some bad shit coming down
one of these days kid.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Oh yeah? Where you going to be? On the
moon?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ung Uh, I’m going to be right here heading
north at a hundred and ten per.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: In this junker?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Cool car.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Uh Oh! The Rodriguez brothers.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Motherfucker just flipped you off.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Roll the window down.] Roll the window
down.</p>
<p><strong>lagarto</strong>: A donde vas, pendejo?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: A chingas tu esposa!</p>
<p><strong>a brother</strong>: Hey Bud, hey Bud, who’s your new
girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Watch it mother fucker.</p>
<p><strong>lagarto</strong>: Hey fuck you pussy punk.</p>
<p>**[otto**: Holy shit.]</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Want me to take them?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Wo! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: God damn dipshit Rodriguez gypsy dildo punks.
I’ll get your ass!</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: HAHAHA WOW! That was intense.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Repo man’s always intense. Come on let’s go get
a drink.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Gee bud. You never told me it was going to be
like this man. Cops and robbers. Hahahahah. Real live car chases.
Hahahahah.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Shit ! Debbi!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If you say our names we’ll have to kill all
these people Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: They all ran away.</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: Come on you douche bags.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Awful quiet in here. It’s too quiet.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: So who are these Rodriguez boys.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Rodriguez brothers. Lagarto and Napoleon. Two
notorious delinquents currently responsible for at least thirty vehicles
in the field.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Scumbags</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: They ain’t scumbags. They car thieves just
like use.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: There’s Miss Magruder. You want to go for
it?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Good gag, you pull this one a lot?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Only on the women. It never fails.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Excuse me? Miss Magruder? I have something
here for you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. magruder</strong>: Uhm how utterly charming.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Ow! Ow! Ow! Motherfucker! Ow! Ow! Ow! Christ!
I’m blind man. Lite? Lite, where are you man?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ruthside Peason brokerage consultant. Fucking
millionaire six payments behind. I’ve never understood it.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The fucking millionaires. They never pay their
bills. See you at the yard.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Let me get this one.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No. I’ll handle this one. Mister Peason is
carrying a permit for a pistol.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Don’t underestimate me ace.</p>
<p><strong>ruthside peason</strong>: And also, naturally, I’d like them
to be right next to each other. In addition I’d like them to be as close
to the window as possible so I can sit in my car and watch my things. So
all you have to do is take your clothes out of here like this and put
them into a machine over there like that.</p>
<p><strong>ruthside peason</strong>: Oh my god ! Oh! Oh my god !

<p><strong>otto</strong>: Hey! Hey! You want a ride? Hey babe need a

<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Pick it up! Look at you. You pick it up.
You know yourself you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well what were they doing out in the middle of

<p><strong>old lady</strong>: They weren’t in the middle of the street.
That not the middle of the street that’s the corner.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Go on you pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: You pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Haha, no way. You still want a ride or

<p><strong>old lady</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: My name is Otto.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Leila. Is this your car?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah it’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Heh, one of them? You think you’re pretty
slick don’t ya? I bet you’re a used car salesman.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I am not.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: You dress like one.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I’m a repo man.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: It�s a repossesser. I take back cars from
dildos who don’t pay their bills. Cool huh?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Those men in the car next to us don’t look at
them. Don’t look at them! If they see me they’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Really why?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Ow! What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What’s this? It looks like sausage.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: It isn’t sausage Otto. That’s a picture of
four dead aliens.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Laugh away fuckface that picture is going to
be on the cover of ever major newspaper in two days time.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Part of a secret network. A scientist who is
also in our secret sect smuggled the corpses off of this air force base.
Now he’s got them in the truck of his car. It’s a Chevy Malibu. We’ve
got to find him.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What are you going to do with them, put them
on Johnny Carson?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Yes! We’re going to have a press conference
and tell the world.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Ehw. What’s that? I don’t know dear. But it
is alive. It seems friendly though. Aw look it’s curled up. How cute oh
no. Maybe we can take it home it doesn’t seem to have any. Oh yes let’s.
But no! No matter how appealing do not let strange creature in you
house. We all know strange creatures are on the increase. Many of them
do seem furry and adorable, but beware we don’t know from whence they
came. Be safe. Be safe. Report strange incidences today.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: United fruitcake outlet.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: My door doesn’t open.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Sure Ummm I don’t know. what do you think? Ah
want to go out with me again sometime?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: I don’t know. I’m going to be kind of busy
with work, the Malibu and everything.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Hey great. Terrific. Here’s your shit .</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: What’s your problem? I mean girls might like
you if you lightened up a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Fuck . Girls pay to go out with me. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: You wanna get back in the car?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What, here?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy Malibu?</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Who’s double X finance?</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Store front operation, but the money is in
escrow.</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Want me to notify the boys?</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Uh, naw. They’re always bitching about their
case load. I think I’ll go out for a while.</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Why? We out of beer?</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Somebody has to work around here. Keep making
me money kid.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Man we’ve been looking for this little red
devil for a long time. Just act natural. Nobody knows if it�s your car
or somebody elses car.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Now you work with that. You give it a try. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Let me give you a hand we don�t have a whole
year to find it boy.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Lets get out of here. Put your seat belt
on.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Put your seat belt on boy! I don’t ride with
anybody unless they wear their seatbelt. It’s one of my rules.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Put that damn gun down boy. It ain’t no
toy.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: I walk into someone’s place of work. They shit
scared. They know I’m not a cop. They think I’ve come to kill ’em and I
would. I’d kill anybody who crosses me. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Do you like music?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: In that case you’re going love this.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: I was into these dudes before anybody. Partied
with them all the time. Asked me to be their manager. I called bullshit
on that. Managing a pop group hey that ain’t no job for no man.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You read that book I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What book?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Unh uhg</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You’d better read it and quick. That book will
change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: A lot of people don’t realize what’s really
going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and
things. They don’t realize that there’s this like lattice of coincidence
that lays on top of everything. I’ll Give you an example, show you what
I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody
will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no
explanation. No point in looking for one either. It’s all part of a
cosmic unconsciousness.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the
hippie days?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I’ll give you another instance. You know the
way everybody’s into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets
about Bermuda triangles, UFO’s, how the Mayans invented television. That
kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I don’t read them books.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Well the way I see it it’s exactly the same.
There ain’t no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine.
People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole
thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of
people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like
disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize
something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Well where did all these people come from?
hmmm? I’ll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people
disappear to? hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: The past?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: That’s right and how did they get there?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: How the fuck do I know?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you
got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my
best thinking on the bus. That how come I don’t drive, see?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: You don’t even know how to drive.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I don’t want to know how. I don’t want to
learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You know I think I saw one of those things
once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of
scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and
lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Bud.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Do you think all repo men follow the code?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked
up cars come in but…99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked
them up. Assholes .</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m offering a thousands dollars for his
Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon? It’s a bribe.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who the
fuck are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s a grand if you show me where his car is
Napoleon.</p>
<p>**[napoleon**: Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hello? Prick .</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Waiting!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: We could buy ten of them for that,
Marlene.</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Think you can find it now?</p>
<p><strong>bud in the street</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Now how come this junk is worth so much?
What’s in it? Drugs?</p>
<p><strong>bud in the street</strong>: Got all night amigo!</p>
<p><strong>lagarto</strong>: Los Hermanos Rodriguez don’t approve of
drugs.</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Neither do I, but it’s my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>bud in the street</strong>: I’m going to get your .</p>
<p>**[marlene**: That motherfucker’s still down there.]</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t care how long it takes, dildos . Repo
man’s got all night every night.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: twenty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto. The
guy who gave you a ride and stuff. I heard something about that car.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something
to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Otto? Otto!</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: What did you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Oh! Take off your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: I’m at work, Otto!</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Oh yeah? Me too.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Your work is different than mine.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: What are you doing.? Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>[otto</strong>: Well the least you could do is give me a blow
job.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Heh, I guess that means no.]</p>
<p><strong>deadra</strong>: Leila? We have a cell meeting in two minutes
time.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Thanks Deadra. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: See that motherfucker only thinks I don’t know
what’s going on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy I’m going indy. I’m
going to buy myself a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and run a yard.
Sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while .</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: No way you can do that on twenty grand
man.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The hell I can as long as you have good credit
and my credit is spotless.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: If I find the Malibu, you won’t see me for
dust, I’m going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of
tomato plants.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Credit is a sacred trust. It’s what our free
society is founded on. You think they give a damn about their bills in
Russia? I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in
Russia?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: They don’t pay bills in Russia. It’s all
free.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All free? Free my ass, what are you a fucking
commie? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: No I ain’t no commie.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well you’d better not be I don’t want any
commies in my car. No Christians either.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll deal with you later. I’ve got a customer
to attend to. You too.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hi! I’m Kevin. Vacuum sir?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Need a vacuum sir?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Have you any machines?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You don’t want to eat from a machine. Look,
there’s a nice Del Taco across the street. They’ve got enchurritos and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: But I do want to eat from a
machine. Vended food contains all the necessary nutrients for survival.
Taste damn good too, by golly. And plus, on any given evening, the
machine that last night gave you cheetos might dispense instead…
Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos . Or Lorna Doones.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk? Scuze
me.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hi! I’m Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don’t
you remember me? I was here yesterday. Heh. Listen I think I left a book
of matches over in your office over there. You want to go and check for
me huh?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Hey thanks a lot buddy.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Any thing for you babes.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: All right, you’re beautiful. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: It’s really very simple Mrs. Parks. You don’t
want me to take your car and I don’t want to take your car. Now I said
to the boss I said ah Look! I do not want to repossess this lady�s
car.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: Well I’ve been in the hospital you
see.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really on
the line over this one. I could lose it right away.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: I’ll see if I can borrow some money from
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: That’s terrific. Really terrific.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: Oh how was the rehearsal son?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks’ son</strong>: It was O.K. Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: Oh this is Mr. Otto. He’s from the
finance company. He’s been telling me that he isn’t going to take the
car this time, even though he could.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well, uh, gotta get going here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: Did you like the tea?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: The tea?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah, it was terrific.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Thank you</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Uh excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parks</strong>: I gave you the money last week to pay it
and you didn’t do it. What did you do with it? I’m so tired of giving
you money and you squandering it. I know what you done you all went out
dancing some where. That’s what you did. Next time I give you some money
I want you to put it in the car ya hear. You’re working. How come you
didn’t do it huh? I don’t know what’s happened to you.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Hey it’s cool. It’s cool. I like music too
man, hey</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: Some people aren’t cut out to be repo
men. Why don’t you smarten up kid?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Fuck you Plettschner! OWW! OWW!</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: Don’t you say fuck you to me. Don’t you
know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah you’re Plettschner.</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: You’re fucking right I’m Plettschner.
Otto Plettschner. Three times decorated in two world wars. I was killing
people while you were still swimming around in your father’s balls . You

<p><strong>otto</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: So what? So never say fuck you to me.

<p><strong>lite</strong>: Hey kid I need a contract driver.</p>

going to melt. I think we better take a look, all right?</p>
<p><strong>lagarto</strong>: Go get us two sodas.</p>

<p><strong>lagarto</strong>: We’re just the mules, comprende? …</p>

<p><strong>leila</strong>: To find out what I know. I’d torture someone
in a second if it was up to me.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Huh? Why are you looking for the Malibu?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: Because of the trunk. The aliens inside.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Illegal aliens?</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: No, Silly, Extraterrestrials.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Ahhh, heh. Did you ever think about joining

<p><strong>otto</strong>: Ow you bastards !</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey take it easy. Take it easy. The guys head
is hurt.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: This is too personal sonny. The thing is a repo
man got beat up in the line of duty. Now it doesn’t matter that that man
was you. What really matters is that the guy that did it has got to pay
the price. Now stop being selfish and tell us his name.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Come on.</p>

<p><strong>bud</strong>: . Makes you wonder how much they owe. Most of
them are on the run. Don’t even use their fucking social security
numbers. If there was just some way to find out how much the
motherfuckers owe and making them pay.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Jesus Christ bud. They’re winos, they don’t
have any money. You think they’d be bums if they did?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You want out? Do ya?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s a matter with you? Don’t you like your
job anymore? Not too happy in your job? I mean I feel like were not

you something share something with you for Christ’s sake. Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I’m picking up the dead. I’m putting my hands
around this dead body. I’m, I’m carrying his limp torso to the truck.
And he feels like like he has only been dead a little while but…</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: J. Frank Parnell.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: ott, ott…</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: What line of work you in?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: re, re, re..</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Rock’n’roller, eh!? I used to be a
musician myself, college days. Of course it was folk songs and protest
songs back then. We shall overcome, we shall overcome…</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Did you ever feel as if your mind
had started to erode?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Ever been to Utah?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Nuh-uh</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: I go to Utah every year. Friend of
mine, was a designer of the MX missile race track basing mode. A hundred
thousand miles of railroad track on a big loop through Utah, Arizona,
and Nevada. Bombs were going to hide in locomotive sheds. That way the
red team would never know exactly where they were. I still go out to
Utah, just to think about the way things might have been.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance
Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Radiation, yes indeed! You hear
the most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked goggle-boxed do-gooders
telling everybody it�s bad for you. Pernicious nonsense! Everybody could
stand a hundred chest X-rays a year. They ought to have ’em too. When
they canceled the project it almost did me in. One day my mind was
literally a-burst. The next day nothing. Swept away… But I showed them.
I had a lobotomy in the end.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Lobotomy? Isn’t that for loonies?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Not at all. A friend of mine had
one. Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear of the neutron bomb?
Destroys people. Leaves buildings standing. It fits in a suit case. It’s
so small no one knows it’s there until blammo. Eyes melt skin explodes
everybody dead. It’s so immoral working on the thing can drive you mad.
That’s what happened to this friend of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now
he’s well again.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What kind of car does your… does your friend
drive?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Chevy Malibu.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: And you do the same type of work?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Didn’t I tell you? I can’t tell
you what I do. I’m classified.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: This is really a nice old car. Why don’t you
let me drive?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well I don’t know. I mean…uh! Don’t you feel
funny.?</p>
<p><strong>j. frank parnell</strong>: Why should I feel funny? The two
hemispheres are fundamentally at odds. Hemisphere, Hemisphere. You know
it’s strange. I do feel funny…</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: By the way kid, sign this.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What is this?</p>

you in case we get sued. . . Don’t read the damn thing, kid, just sign
it.</p>
<p><strong>repo wife 1</strong>: Here’s the young new-waver we’ve all
heard so much about.</p>

met him. He was in the service then.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: He signed it over to me. But he didn�t
realize-</p>
<p><strong>repo wife 2</strong>: My old man was such a monster. I used
to have to tell him no.</p>
<p><strong>repo wife 1</strong>: My old man was exactly the same way
until we got married.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Hey Oly. You’re wife’s hanging all over
Otto.</p>
<p><strong>oly</strong>: Yeah. Like flies on shit .</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Um. Have you see uh bud anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>repo wife 1</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: …another wonderful Christian opportunity. The
Reverend Larry…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey there hero. Get the money yet?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Not yet. Oly’s going to get it for me though.
I just signed the papers.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Whu, what do you mean, what papers?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Beats me, just some, uh, contract or
something.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Didn’t you read it?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well, no, just, uh, standard practice, uh,
contract…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Melonfarmer Oly! …oooh, shoot.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What, is that not a happening deal?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey ace. Wait up.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: So you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Talk about what kid?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Why you’re so damn mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m not mad at you. damn. I’m not. I’m not mad
at you.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: All right O.K.</p>

Get a little house. I want you to have my baby.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well I don’t know. Every body does it. And it
just seems like the thing to do and…</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: Asshole.]</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Let’s go do the job.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Duke! Debbie! What what are you guys doing

<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’s it look like ace?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Up against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m going to kill him. I’m going to kill him.
I’m going to kill everybody. ha-ha-ha</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Drop it motherfucker .</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oww shit .</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Debbie Ah. Ah Do You, uh, do you think it’s
too late uh for us to get romantically involved?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I think a little.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Wait! Wait! Stick with me. I’ll make you a
repo wife.</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: Bollocks. Here.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Otto?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Yeah I’m here man.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The lights are growing dim. I know a life of
crime led me to this sorry fate. And yet I I blame society. Society made
me what I am.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: That’s bullshit . You’re a white suburban
punk, just like me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But it still hurts.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: You’re going to be all right man</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Yep he’s dead all right.</p>

<p><strong>agent</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Booth’s setting him on fire</p>
<p><strong>reverend larry on tv</strong>: …fail to register for
patriotic chores. So, please call this toll free number. Praise the
lord. There is no redemption for the unredeemed, no escape for the fair
weather patriots. No salvation from the boiling blistering fires of
eternal damnation. Now these are the end times. Because in these days
there shall be hell in time. Man shall be lovers of their own self
rather than lovers of God.</p>
<p><strong>otto’s dad</strong>: Haven’t seen you in a while, Son.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: No escape…</p>
<p><strong>otto’s mom</strong>: Some men were just here looking for you,
Otto.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: No salvation from the blistering files of
eternal damnation. For in these days there shall be hell in time, there
shall be war and more war, and earthquakes in diverse places…</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: What kind of men?</p>
<p><strong>otto’s mom</strong>: Very nice young men. They wore
sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Well, what did you tell them? Did you tell
them I was sick?</p>
<p><strong>otto’s dad</strong>: We told them the truth, son. Gave them
your address at work.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: Money shall run out and the people will line up
at the banks and there won’t be anything . . . these prophecies are in
your bible. The same one that you have in your home. Now I want you to
get up off of your sofa and put that beer down and go wherever it is in
your house pick up that book and turn with me…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Where’s the car baby? That Chevy Malibu baby.

<p><strong>otto</strong>: Jeeze.</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: You got to stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: It’s none of your business. You want to

<p><strong>otto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: A chicken man. Did you ever see a
farmer’s wife? Huh?</p>

<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Come and get me. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>plettschner</strong>: I’ve been wanting to do that one for a
long time honey.</p>
<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Come on. Come on. Come on if you think your
man enough.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Hey Fletch. Coffee break.</p>
<p><strong>agent rogersz</strong>: Good evening Otto. This is agent
Rogersz. I’m going to ask you a few questions. And since time is short
and you may lie, I’m going to have to torture you. But I want you to
know it isn’t personal.</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: Look Ah this isn’t really necessary. I’ll tell
you anything you want to know.</p>
<p><strong>agent rogersz</strong>: Good! Where is the Malibu?</p>
<p><strong>otto</strong>: I don’t know. Somebody ripped it from the
yard.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: I don’t think he knows.</p>
<p><strong>agent rogersz</strong>: Increase the voltage.</p>
<p><strong>leila</strong>: But what if he’s innocent?</p>
<p><strong>agent rogersz</strong>: No one is innocent. Proceed.</p>

hair nets, those ridiculous trench coats. They’re pathetic.</p>

<p><strong>marlene</strong>: Bye, Bye.</p>
<p><strong>voice from the radio</strong>: Here’s another weird one.
