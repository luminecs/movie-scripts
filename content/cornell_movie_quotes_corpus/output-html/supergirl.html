<p><strong>alexander salkind</strong>: presents</p>
<p><strong>cantharus productions n.v.</strong>: All Rights Reserved</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: And now, who can give me the electron wave
functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: The cube root of the wavelength over the
natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Well, maybe that was a bit too easy…</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: What are you making:</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It’s going to be a tree, I think.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: What’s a tree?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It’s something they have on Earth. You know,
where your cousin went.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Where is Earth?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Didn’t you study six-dimensional geometry in
school?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yes, I know the equations—I just can’t see it
in my head.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Even I have trouble with that sometimes.
Earth is in outer space. And we’re in inner space.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Wait till you’re older. Here – watch
this.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar.</strong>: This is one of the four Power Sources of
the City. I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I can do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: You see, a tree is a living thing.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Can you create life?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real thing. But it is lovely, the
way the light plays over the surface. . .</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Kara. Kara.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’m here, mother.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: Kara, you shouldn’t be so near the Edge
without a grown-up.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’m sorry, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I was keeping an eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the
rules.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: You and your husband have been kind to me,
Alura. I have something to tell you: I’m going away. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But where?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Put your fingers there, Kara. And press
hard.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Good. Now, go make something pretty.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I’ve discovered a new way into the Phantom
Zone.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But the phantom Zone is for criminals.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It’s big. And empty. I’m tired of limiting
myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I’m starting to repeat
myself here with this airy, glittery stuff….</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But Zaltar—you founded the city! It’s yours.
We were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered us together and
brought us here, to the inner dimension. You can’t abandon us now. You
have a responsibility to us!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I’m an artist, Alura. My work comes first.
Other people come second.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: How can you create beauty…with a selfish
heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the
little girl’s head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear.
She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin
membrane that encloses the city.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Kara—the Power Source!</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’m sorry… I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It was my fault. You aren’t old enough to
use the wand. I shouldn’t have given it to you.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But the Power Source, Zaltar.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It couldn’t be helped. The city will have to
make do with three.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But what will happen?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: The Guardians will be angry. They may even
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn’t really have permission to
borrow it. I must go explain to them…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Over here George. It’s the perfect spot.
Nice view.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that
looks too pretty to eat.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Better eat it quick. It won’t look too
pretty when it’s all covered with ants.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Selena, I’ve been thinking. It’s time I
settled down—and I don’t know a nicer lady to settle down with than
you.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Why George, are you proposing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn’t
bring in much now, but…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: George—I thought you’d never ask.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the heck is that?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: A squirrel Frisbee?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: That’s funny. I’d swear I know just what
this is, but I’ve never seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, where you going?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I’ve got things to do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about my proposal?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Call me next week. Maybe we can have
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey! My truck!</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But Kara, you are too young to go.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I am almost an adult. This is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to
Earth. The journey is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: It was my fault we lost the Power Source.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole
it.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I allowed it to escape the City.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: Ever since we told you how your cousin
Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was
visit this place.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our
scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth. It could
destroy everything unless someone brings it back.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: Superman will return it.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Why haven’t you been able to contact him? He
should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be
dead.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: But what can you, a mere girl-</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’ll have super powers there. Like him. We
can’t wait. Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a child
the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: What do your teachers think?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: It would be sad to lose one of our finest
young ones to the dimension barrier– but the City cannot last much
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she’s fighting for,
Zor-El.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: Very well, let it be done.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Don’t worry, Mother, I’ll be all right. I’ve
studied the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.</p>
<p><strong>alura</strong>: But they are such strange, unstable
people.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Then I will learn to act strange like
them.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I have made clothing and copies of their
money, I will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>zor-el</strong>: Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: As brave as my father. As wise.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Be careful. Nigel is going to try
something.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Don’t worry about old Nigel, I can take care
of him. He’s just a sore loser.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: I don’t want much, Selena. I have
simple tastes.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Western Europe.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I’m sorry, but I already promised Bianca she
could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: No problem. She can have it. I hate
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Cheer up, Nigel. It’s not the end of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: It may well be. I know how you won that
election Selena. You can’t fool me.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I have plans Nigel. You could come with me…
I’m going places.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. Except back to
nowheresville. You’re too impatient, Selena. Look around you–all these
people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their
families have been in the Craft for generations. You can’t join and take
over our whole organization in a few months.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I just did. Because I have the Power.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You’re going to pay a terrible price. The
power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Bianca’s taught me all! need to know. I’ll
be safe, as long as I don’t go too far.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Nigel, get out of here. And don’t come
slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You need me, Selena. I’m the only one who can
save you from a terrible fate.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower.
Now burn rubber.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Make me.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Balefire on you, Selena!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You Scorpios can never take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You think you are on top now. Well there is
someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Throw him out.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You won’t last a year, Selena. The cards
don’t lie!</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Let’s not let one rotten apple spoil the
party. I give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the
Circle: Selena!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Thank you, sisters and brothers of the
Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed – you will learn that we
are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was
our leader.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother–the
spirit of Nature — to bless all our endeavors in the coming year…</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Is this Nigel’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It’s a warning, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Maybe it was just an accident.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: There’s no such thing as an accident.
Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Then what does it mean???</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Don’t ask me. I can’t read the signs worth
spit.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Geeze, another barfy new student. They’re
really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Don’t you believe in knocking?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I
forgot.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m Linda Lee.</p>
<p><strong>mr . danvers</strong>: Cousin? Wrote me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The letter’s in your files. Under K, for
Kent.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I mean, it would probably be there, if you
received it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Here it is. Oh…of course. You’re the
orphan. I’m so sorry about your parents. We’ll try to make you happy
here.</p>
<p><strong>mr danvers</strong>: …since your school records were lost in
the fire, we’11 start you out easy first. You’ll have English, Latin,
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology and Computing. Later on,
you can add some electives. I think we’ll put you in “G” dorm.</p>
<p><strong>student monitor</strong>: Man on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Lucy, your roommate still home with
anorexia?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It wasn’t anorexia. It was the food.</p>
<p><strong>mr danvers</strong>: Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room
with her. Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her cousin, MR., uh,
Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of enthusiasm. She grabs Linda’s suitcase
and leads her into the room chattering away excitedly.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Wow, you’re Clark’s cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark’s
a hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one get away. You’ll
love it here, we have a great dorm, some really insane characters, I
mean radical craziness…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No sweat. When’s the rest of your stuff
arriving?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: This is all your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I have money to buy more, but I haven’t had a
chance since…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house
or something?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’d rather not talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re not…an orphan are you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: My cousin Clark is my only relative on
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh wow, I should’ve known. Me and my big
mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thank you. You’re very kind.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m real sorry, Linda, I should’ve known it
was something tragic if you show up without a wardrobe. Here, try on
this. And this.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: She did that deliberately.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: She’s a beast.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Must’ve been a defective puck.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She’s out to get
you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But what for?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: She just hates anybody who isn’t afraid of
her.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Are they in?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold
water.</p>
<p><strong>muffy</strong>: But, Myra, why don’t you shut off the hot
water and give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, could
scald them.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: So they lose a little skin. Serve ’em
right.</p>
<p><strong>mr danvers</strong>: Now, this is the kind of problem that
used to take weeks before the computer. It still takes a long time
without certain algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Linda? Are you with us?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The answer is 5,271,009,010.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: You may go, Linda. But try not to clown
around in the future.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Stop the car!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I said stop, I didn’t say run into a brick
wall.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must
be near .</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous
about a baseball game?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Softball.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It must be the girls. One of the girls.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: But which one?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Drive on. We have already attracted enough
attention.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: We’ll bide our time and keep watch. Young
girls just can’t keep a secret. If one of them’s up to something–we’ll
find out.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: And then, like great cats—we pounce! And
destroy!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when
you’re at the wheel. OK?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Sorry, mistress.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Hey, Linda, you in there?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How much longer you gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re a maniac! Let me do it for you. You’ll
look awful.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I can manage, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the
only thing was to go totally punk!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Your hair looks the same.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It was just a trim.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from
home.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: A hair dryer that makes popcorn!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No thanks. You go on.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mother! Is it you? Where are you???</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mother, this world is so big. I don’t know
where to begin to look.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But why? I have super powers. Nothing can
hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>mr . danvers</strong>: Five billion, two hundred and
seventy-one million, nine thousand, and ten.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: No plans for the weekend, Linda?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, MR. Danvers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Can’t have you moping around the
campus. Why don’t you come home with us for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Is he your entertainment for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: He will be. In about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Finished your estimate?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, there’s several ways to go .</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Come in, have a drink, we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You must be very popular in the
neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I have a lot of repeat business. People seem
to like my service.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I bet they do.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What’s that big black scar on the ground?
Like a fire.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Oh, you know how parties are. Always some
damage.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Now we could put in rhododendrons or
lilacs…depending on how alkaline your soil is.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I just love plants and growing things. It
must be wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Uh, no thanks, I don’t drink during the
day.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: But look, it’s almost sundown!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Really, I’m not thirsty. Now I could put in
some honeysuckle there and there…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Just take a sip or .I’ll be hurt. It’s an
old family recipe, I’m famous for them.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: A passionfruit smoothee.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, just one.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: To us. And to the seeds we’ll plant
together.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hmmm. Delicious!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Now, about my fee…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my
eyes and be all mine.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: If that’s the Jehovah’s Witnesses again…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Don’t go away, gorgeous. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Nigel, get lost.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You’re wasting your breath.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You used to listen to me. When you asked me
to teach you something of the Craft.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I could teach you a thing or two now.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: …trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the
Great Mother to protect us… Why. are you staring at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I was just thinking, if I had your skin
problems, I’d use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Nothing’s wrong with my skin.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Such a shame. You ought to take better care
of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Nasty bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Ethan. Come back. You’ll spoil
everything!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. danvers</strong>: I think you’d better be getting back
to the dorm, Linda. The housemother’ll expect you to sign in by
eight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thank you both so much. It was a lovely
lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you’re a terrific chess
player MR. Danvers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: What? Me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sure. Mate in five moves.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: …and there goes my king. Got to hand it to
you, I didn’t see it coming. Well, bye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs . danvers</strong>: What a lovely child. Such nice
manners. We must have her back, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Show me Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: The silly fool!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Hey, Linda! It’s my roommate. You’ll love her.
She’s really off the wall!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Linda babes! There’s this all-night party at
Eddie’s… his folks are away…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I’m not signed out for an
overnight.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom
window. McCloskey’s always zonked out: she’ll never hear you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It doesn’t seem right.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Please, as a favour to me? So I won’t be the
only girl?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Look at that guy!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What a space cadet. Hey, you dingleberry! Get
outta the street!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why is he acting so strangely?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I dunno, but he’s gonna get creamed.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Power of Shadows…bring him to me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Omigod, it’s a runaway!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Lucy; come back!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Somebody’s gotta do something!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My baby!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My baby.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Everything’s going to be all right. She’s
just unconscious. No broken bones.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: God…you’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: That was meant for me!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Thank you. I’m going to close this up
again.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Wait…don’t leave me in here…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s for your own protection.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I’m taking you to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let me out. I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where’s the casualties? You can’t tell me
there’s no casualties.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I came as quickly as I could. What is the
danger?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It’s what we were warned about.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: A Storm Dragon?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: No, a super girl.</p>
<p><strong>first intern</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>second intern</strong>: Maybe we better take a look.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: When can I see, you again ?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a
bad dream. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>first intern</strong>: Did we use the laughing gas
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>second intern</strong>: That was last night.</p>
<p><strong>first intern</strong>: Then this is really happening.</p>
<p><strong>second intern</strong>: Hey fella, can you talk???</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like
this before. I love her. My angel.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Where is she? I love her, don’t you
understand? I’ll die if I can’t have her.</p>
<p><strong>first intern</strong>: She’s right here fella.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried
us through the air:. She can fly. She’s an angel.</p>
<p><strong>second intern</strong>: This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got a
412. Send down the boys from psycho.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No! She’s real ! I saw her !</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Why did she have to show up now?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Eliminate her.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: That’s easy for you to say, Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You can do it. You’re the most powerful
woman on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Am I? Still?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing
can withstand its power.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I’ve been saving it. For the right
moment.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: That moment is now! What good is a sword
unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again.
No one.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Not even Nigel.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What do I do? I don’t know her name.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just
concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever
she be. Find her and destroy her.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Next time, remind me to do this out in the
yard.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I think I’d better keep it.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Yes. Whatever I say. From now on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. danvers</strong>: The housemother still doesn’t
answer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Probably drunk again. I’m sure Linda
got back all right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. danvers</strong>: We should have driven her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: I’ll just drop by the school and. make
sure she’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey, that’s my roommate’s car!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Leave this place and do no harm.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: A Supergirl… Linda…is it Linda?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I didn’t want anyone to know… but I was
so tired…forgot…</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Just need rest, that’s all. Sorry about
all the damage outside. I had to fight some terrible thing…</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: An evil force. Trying to destroy me.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You won’t tell anybody, will you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: Not even my wife. And, if there’s
anything I can do to help—I’d be honoured.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Danvers.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: …come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they
won’t let me have anything, but make sure it’s Jamocha Almond Fudge . .
Listen, I got to run, my roommate just walked in. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Hey, Linda-babes! I’ve got so much to tell
you, I don’t know where to begin! Oh – this is Jimmy Olsen, he works
with Clark and my sister at the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nice to meet you. Lucy’s told me all about
you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper
business.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m afraid I have some bad news about your
car.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Mr. Danvers called. I’ll get a new one with
the insurance money. B.F.D.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you have any theories about last
night?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Theories?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital.
And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak
tornado. I’d like to interview you for the Daily- -</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, Jimmy, can’t you forget about your career
for one second?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: – Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you
think it was natural, or like some people are claiming,
supernatural?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I believe there’s a rational explanation for
everything. But I don’t know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I quote you?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers
in water before they die?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Listen, I know I’ve been saying you ought
party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He’s private
property. I’ve been waiting years for him to develop.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Nice? He’s cute enough to melt lead!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s off doing a top secret uh,
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I knew it ! He’s working on a hot scoop !</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: This won’t take long. Keep the motor
running.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh no, not you again.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What an adorable hat.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They think I have a concussion.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: And you think you’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: This “love” of yours will soon wear off. I
gave you a temporary love potion.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why should I believe you?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It’s the truth. In twenty-four hours you’ll
forget all about that girl.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Then I’m not the only one who saw her. You
did too!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could
you be interested in that puny little girl?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: But she is real, it wasn’t just a
concussion.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Forget her, you’re mine. I saw you
first.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Here. Drink this. It’s an antidote to the
love drug I gave you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nurse! Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You can’t escape from me that easily. I’m
afraid you don’t know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Don’t think I’m weak, just because I’m a
woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what
I want.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Nurse! Help !</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Would you stop screaming. There are sick
people trying to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Get her away from me. She’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Are you family? Visiting hours are over.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: They’re over for you sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Now you see who you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: This is your problem, right here. This
girl’s driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t want your help.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Come back to my house. My car’s outside.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I never met a man I couldn’t have–and you’re
no different from the rest!</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Okay, what’s going on in h–</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Power of Shadow—seize him.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Doctor, I think you’ re going to have a gas
problem.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I shouldn’t have had the cabbage at
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Omigod.</p>
<p><strong>delivery boy</strong>: Where you want this?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Over by the window. It must be from my sister.
Give him a tip, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, Lucy, it’s nice to see you’re feeling
better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re not gonna stay for the ice cream?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I have to get back. I’m having dinner with
the Danvers.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Again? You’re getting real tight with them.
You’re gonna be a straight-A student—just kidding, thanks for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I give you a lift?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s no trouble. I’d like to ask you some
more questions.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Give up?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What goes up must come down.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I probably would’ve got a ticket without this
press pass on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I wouldn’t know. Look. Up in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: An escaped wacko! What a picture!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Come down from there, you foo1…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: …before you get blown off and kill
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Someone’s chasing him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Say—you think that’s the same guy who was in
the accident with Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The scoop of the year!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It’ll be dark soon. And cold. Come down
while you’ve got the chance.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No. She’ll come for me. Like she did the last
time. My angel.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: She’s not coming for you. I killed her.
She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No. I don’t believe you. It’s not true. She’s
alive somewhere. My angel. My love–</p>
<p><strong>selena’s voice</strong>: You idiot!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There goes my Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Darn!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey lady, did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The girl—dressed like Superman–caught that
guy in mid-air.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Really? Maybe you should check into the
hospital and have your head examined.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re alive! She didn’t kill you!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Who didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That woman who’s after me. She hates you.
Because she knows I love you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You love me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: My angel. My goddess. I feel I’ve always
loved you all my life. I’ll die if I can’t spend the rest of my life
just looking at you, holding you in my arms…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: We have to have a long talk about all
this.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I know just the place. Hang a left at the
Amalgamated Tower.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Home?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: No way. I’m not going to let that little
hussy make a monkey out of me.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Is it her that’s bothering you–or your
gardener?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I use men, but I’m not addicted to them. I
can quit whenever I want.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This is my favourite place in the city.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Are you sure it’s all right for us to be
here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They don’t care, they’re tearing it down for
a shopping centre.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Like it?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Yes. It reminds me of home.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Where Superman’s from? Krypton?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock
that was part of Krypton once—but we moved it to inner space.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s not important. The important thing
is I’m here to find something and I think you can he1p me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Come on, let’s ride.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I used to work here summers when I was a
kid.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan, tell me more about this woman
who’s after you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let’s talk about us, not her.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Tell me where I can find her.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t want you to go near her. She’s bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: But be reasonable. If I don’t do
something to stop her she’ll try again. And maybe hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll be safe with you. We can stay together
the rest of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: We can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why not ?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: We’re from different worlds.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Just give me a chance to show how much I love
you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: All this talk about love, it’s silly.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You don’t like me? You hate me?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Of Course I don’t hate you. I don’t hate
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What do you feel about me?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I…I don’t know. This is all so
sudden.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: There’s one sure way to find out how you
feel.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let me kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re not afraid are you?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Of course not, but…there are things we
don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If we wait until we understand everything
we’ll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years
in school.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Well…I guess one is all right.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Is this how?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What a touching scene!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Who are you ?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you’ll
both be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I don’t scare that easily.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can’t have
him, nobody can.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: That ought to keep you out of my hair for
a while.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: A cheap trick.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Cheap but effective.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Supergirl’?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Yookoohoo! No, that’s not it. Sis-o-reb!
Nope. Ka-ma-hoochie!</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Sure glad you didn’t let make a monkey of
you.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Why don’t you use the Coffer of Shadow?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I don’t feel like it right now.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: She didn’t take it from you, did she?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some
tools.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: There’s no need. I learned the Craft from my
grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Sycoraka f’kah s’koo…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Good. Now bring the car. We must call a
meeting of the seven.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Yes, mistress.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: There you are. Come to mama.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I thought I’d show you one of my
favourite places.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s paradise . We could be very happy
here.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: But I have to go back. I brought you here
so you’d be safe. From her.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You can’t just abandon me. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I’ll stay for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Great! I’II build a house– right over there,
with a veranda looking out to sea. And I’ll plant a garden! Papayas,
pineapples, bananas, mangoes— anything’ll grow here. And I’II fish in
the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and—</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan—when I said ‘a while’ I meant a
couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Well, maybe a little longer than
that.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>eld erl y man</strong>: The President was giving a speech. I
couldn’t just walk out.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You’re more afraid of the President than
me???</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Let us begin. I invoke the rule of
seven.</p>
<p><strong>others in unison</strong>: The Circle is complete.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You better have a pretty good explanation for
this, Selena.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: We are in great danger. A being has come to
Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.</p>
<p><strong>indian woman</strong>: But Superman has been away.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: It is not Superman I speak of, but his
cousin Kara. She knows we exist..</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Then she must be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: How did she find out about us?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: That is unimportant. Now that she
knows, she will become curious and learn more. When she learns we plan
to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries
of persecution—she will try to stop us.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: We must destroy her first.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: But how can we destroy her?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person
must volunteer to take on the combined power of us all.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You! You want to take our power for
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Nige1, you know the one who takes on
Ultimate Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Which of you is willing to make that
sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: You would! You revealed our existence so you
could have all of our power.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Maybe you’d like to get rid of this
Supergirl yourself, Nigel?</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Why get rid of her at al1? You’ve used the
Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Enough quibbling. Let us vote.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I invoke the rule of seven. Do you
agree?</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan, what IS wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She said it wouldn’t last.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: What wouldn’t last? What’s the matter
with you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t love you any more.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Like turning off a light.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All
that mushy talk.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Away. From you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Because you remind me of all the dumb things
I said.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I sort of like what you said.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That makes it worse.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: But I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Of course you don’t. We’re from two different
worlds, remember?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: At last. Ultimate Power.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: And the first thing we do is get rid of
Supergirl!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What do you mean we?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Hello. Are you still mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m not mad at you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It seemed that way to me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I know I was acting funny—I’m sorry. It’s
just…I miss it.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Miss what?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What I had before. What’s not there now. It’s
like I woke up and found part of me wasn’t there any more: something
that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the
first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly—you and me
and the world around us–like we were a wonderful song…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: And now…the guitars are out of tune, and the
words don’t make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Well…I don It know much about these
things, but maybe if you had that feeling once…it can, come back.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I don’t see why not.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: But what if—it wasn’t real?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Feelings are real. Once you’ve had them,
they’re yours forever.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe
we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe
something might. happen again. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Are you asking me for a “date”?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why not? You’re a good-looking girl. And I’m—
available.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting about Selena?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She’ll forget about us eventually.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: There’s something very dangerous about
her. Something evil…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I know what it is. She has this lead
container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there’s a silvery ring…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: That’s the Power Source that was lost
from Argo City! That’s what I came: to find! Where does she live?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: In this big old house on Orchard Avenue—but
you better stay away from there.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I can see through walls. I could surprise
her. The only thing I can’t see through is lead, that’s why I didn’t see
the Power Source at the amusement park.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Wait. Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You’ll be safe here. I’ll come back as
soon as I have the Power Source.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Before you go…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Just one kiss. For old times’ sake.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: And you can see how you feel about me,
right?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Hey take it easy. I won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared
me. But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. Nigel warned us. Wouldn’t
listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: What are you talking about? Where’s
Selena?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: No. Don’t want to know. She’s bad. Don’t go
near her. Hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I have to find her. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Supergirl! She’s waiting for you. On Taliesen
Mountain. Stop her before it’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m wise to your tricks, lady.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I could force you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If that worked, you would’ve done it already.
No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you,
sweetheart, it’ll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one
again.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Go on, talk big! I’ll soon have you purring
like a kitten.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You’ve been without water for a whole day.
Let’s see how thirsty you get in a week.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You vicious–</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Careful, don’t make me angry. I start fires
when I’m angry.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I told you I’d win.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It’s
forever.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Ethan! Don’t let her do this!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: No. No. It isn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>alura’s voice</strong>: Kara, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Mother? I can hardly hear you.</p>
<p><strong>alura. s voice</strong>: Kara! You’re alive. We were so
worried. You disappeared from the scanners…</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I’m lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can’t
fly anymore. And I’m weak.</p>
<p><strong>alura’s voice</strong>: Kara, you must not give up. We must
retrieve the Power Source. The City is dying.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Then send someone else. I failed.</p>
<p><strong>alura’s voice</strong>: We can’t. The’ dimension barrier is
stronger. We no longer have the power to push through.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: But Mother, I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>alura’ s voice</strong>: You must try. . . it’s cold. And
dark. . .</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Mother—I tried. I really tried.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of
a new age!</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I bring you a return to the ancient true
worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you
myself as her representative here on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: From this moment forth, all science,
religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I
will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You are talking about the end of
Civilisation as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: And it’s about time too.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I do not know who you are, or what evil
force you represent, but it will take more than a few threats from you
to make mankind turn back the clock and abandon thousands of years of
progress.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Threats? I don’t need threats to destroy
civilisation. I have something better.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Zaltar.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Kara? Is it you?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you
come here from Argo City?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I was on Earth…</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Yes. I went there to find the lost Power
Source…</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Shouldnt’ve done that.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: …but the person who has it. tricked me,
and sent me to the Phantom Zone.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It’s dangerous to use a Power Source on
Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces—</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into
my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I
expect you won’t want to mix with the others– not our type of
people.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Others?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Criminals.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid
them. And you should too.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: …mid pleasures and palaces though I may
roam…”</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: What? Palace? Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of
Argo City…</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Yes. Can’t seem to get away from that style.
Must try something new.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s lovely. . .</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: No, no. Not lovely. ‘Perfect’. Did
everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that
around. Please yourself. That’s the secret of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Are you happy, Zaltar?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: What kind of a question is that? Of course:
I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: But what about other people? Don’t you
miss them?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I look at them all the time. Every planet in
the galaxy. It’s quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that
bruise.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You look at them? How?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If
you have the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: There you see? What could be more boring
than that?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Wait. Could…could I see the place I just
came from?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: It’ll only make you sad.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: This goes closer. This moves it around. And
this begins.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: No more audiences today. Go home. All of
you.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: They want me. Doesn’t it make you proud?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Coming?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Smile, lunk-head. You’re not a gardener any
more, you’re Prince Ethan now.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: That horrible woman!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Told you. Wouldn’t listen to me. Knew it
would make you sad.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: No. I have to see this.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The
Danvers have been arrested!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I saw them dragged out of the Administration
Building.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did anybody notice you?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I can’t help it if men notice me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for
treason!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Just kidding. Nobody saw me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn’t
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I wish they’d tell us what they’re going to do
with us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I heard stories. I don’t think you wanna
know.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Hey! Ethan!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Remember me? We were in a disaster
together.</p>
<p><strong>ethan .</strong>: Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the
other stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Right! Say, do you swing any weight around
here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Can you get us out? It’s all a
misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that
place.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll mention it upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The blonde girl who saved your life—where is
she now?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She’s gone. No one will ever see her
again.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Zaltar, please help me.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Of course, my dear. What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Help me to get back to Earth. Where my
friends are. They need me.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: There’s no way out of the Zone. No one’s
ever escaped. That’s why they send the criminals here.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: If there’s a way in, there must be a way
out.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: No, that’s not true—there’s well…no–</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: There is a way.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: But it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: No, it wouldn’t work, you couldn’t, it’s
too— if it didn’t work you’d be swept into a singularity— no, you’d
never make it. Forget I mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I could do it.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Then teach me how.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: No, it’s no good—you can’t practice— you
only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don’t want a sip of
this? It’s delicious, I think.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Tell me how. to do it. If you could do
it, I can.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Takes a long time, you know, learning the
wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life–can
also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can’t let you take
my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I’d be helpless. It’s out
of the question.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Then come with me.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Leave the zone? What would I do on
Earth?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You could do anything. You could sculpt
mountain ranges…draw with rainbows! You’d have superpowers.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble,
didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Please. I have to get back to Earth. My
friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo
City will die.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You’re going to take me back?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Going to try. Didn’t say I could.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I heard my mother ask you once “how could
a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?” She was wrong, Zaltar,
you have a generous heart.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Not doing this for you. Just sick of this
place, that’s all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you.
Boring!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well thanks a pile, fella.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Guess! Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t know. You seem afraid.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You’re a regular Einstein, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Supergirl?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Quit staring so hard. You’ll strain your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re not going to hurt her, are you?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You can’t put her out of your mind, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well…I guess I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I’m ready for her. I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever,
the serpents will drop them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why the empty cage?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: That one was for you. But I thought I’d wait
and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I’d hate to lose you,
Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: You don’t get this far without paying…a
certain price.</p>
<p><strong>mr. danvers</strong>: If only I hadn’t made that speech
denouncing her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs . danvers</strong>: I’m not afraid to die. I’m proud of
you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ve been in love with you for years.
Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your
fingerprints on my lens.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Remember? I was trying desperately to get
you’re attention.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You were? You mean we could’ve been…
you-know-what… all this time?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You bet your ass.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re supposed to guess.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Why are you stopping?</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn’t
do.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Oh dear!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: The wand. Use it.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Good girl! That’s the way!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: You can use the wand.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Better than when I was a child.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: I remember you then. Cute thing you were.
Like your mother.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: What’s that? Never saw anything like
that.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Don’t stop. Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Yes, mustn’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s Selena. I’m getting so I can
recognise her work.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Zaltar. Use the wand!</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Too late. Too late. Save yourself.</p>
<p><strong>zaltar</strong>: Goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Zaltar!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You’re not going to win, Selena. I won’t
let you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish
heart.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank ’you.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You’ve had your fun, Selena, the game is
over.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She has hostages.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: The Danvers. And two of your little
friends.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s just one more crime you’ll have to
pay for.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, what gives?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: All right, Supergirl. The game’s not over
till the last card’s dealt.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: You’ve run out of things to throw,
Selena.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s her shadow-self! Her dark side!</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: How do I fight it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Turn it against her.</p>
<p><strong>real selena</strong>: Power of Shadow, kill her!!</p>
<p><strong>second selena</strong>: No. I am your mistress. Do not harm
me.</p>
<p><strong>real selena</strong>: Don’t listen to her! Kill her! She’s
lying.</p>
<p><strong>second selena</strong>: You are my shadow, you must obey
me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ve got it! The Power Source!</p>
<p><strong>real selena</strong>: No! Stop! Please!</p>
<p><strong>second selena</strong>: Thank you. I’ll take this back to
Argo City.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It is you, then, really?</p>
<p><strong>second selena</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s you all right.</p>
<p><strong>second selena</strong>: I’ll make it easy for you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I couldn’t help what I did, before. She
drugged me.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I never doubted you for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>real selena</strong>: Supergirl. Please! Help! I’m dying…</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: I’m free. I can never thank you enough.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Ever since I found that thing I’ve been like
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to
be mean all the time.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Your nightmares are over. I’m taking this
back to Argo City where it won’t be misused. You could come too. It
might be safer for you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No thanks. I have friends in the resistance.
They’ll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my
memoirs.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: I’ll come back as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What about me? They’ll make, hash out of me
around here.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: She’s right. They’ll string her up.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Do you want to come to Argo City?</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: What’s it like?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s the most beautiful place in the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Sounds O.K. to me. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: Grab hold of this. It forms a force field
for the journey through inner space.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Where is inner space?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: It’s everywhere. But water is always the
door.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Will they be angry with me for stealing the
Power Source?</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: They’ll be grateful. If you hadn’t found
it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>selena</strong>: Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.</p>
<p><strong>supergirl</strong>: That’s home.</p>
