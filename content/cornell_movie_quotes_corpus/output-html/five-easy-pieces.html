<p><strong>1st photo</strong>: A man stands in front of the raised
sounding board of a piano, playing the viola. Seated on the piano bench,
accompanying him, is a woman in a maternity dress:</p>
<p><strong>2nd photo</strong>: A boy of 11, wearing conductor’s tails
and holding a raised baton in his right hand as if about to gesture a
downbeat:</p>
<p><strong>3rd photo</strong>: Another boy of approximately 9, in the
act of playing the violin:</p>
<p><strong>4th photo</strong>: The two boys are now poised behind the
piano. Seated on its bench is a girl of 6, her hands resting on the
keyboard. Written beneath:</p>
<p><strong>5th photo</strong>: The above family group, seated on the
porch of the Dupea home. All eyes but Isabelle’s are faced toward the
camera. She beams upon a 3 year-old asleep in her arms, his head resting
against her bosom. His figure is encircled by the pen’s marking and
preceding his name is the configuration of a small heart:</p>
<p><strong>wynette</strong>: “And if you love him/Oh be proud of him/For
after all, he’s just a man…”</p>
<p><strong>wynette</strong>: “Stand by your man/And show the world you
love him/Keep giving all the love you can/Stand by your man.”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m gonna play it again…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re not going to play it again.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, lemme play the other side then.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Now quit, Bobby. You said you’re goin’ a
help me pick a song.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You said.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, lemme sing the one I picked an’ see
what you think… “When there’s a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound
the alarm…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Oh, you prick…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: How ’bout if I just cut off your damn
water?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m too moved by your gentility to speak.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don’t
you? I’m just tryin’ to get you to take an interest in my kind a things,
an’ what I’m tryin’ to do with myself… You know, there id’n anything in
the world I wouldn’t do for you, baby. I started livin’ the day I found
you, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re playing the other side.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cerveza.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Serveza yourself!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now, now.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: No, dammit, I would easy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But you heal fast.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You can play the piano, an’ your whole damn
family can play on some type a musical instrument. An’ all I’m askin’ is
for you to listen to my singing for one single little second…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: But you think you would? No, you’re too
damn selfish…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why’nt you take ‘at sign off your tit, Ray,
an’ let’s go on out.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know, I’ll holler up Elton an’
Stoney…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’ll go out with you, or I’ll stay here,
and do anything you’d like for me to do… if you’ll just do one thing. If
you’ll tell me that you love me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You can sing the song.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You know what, you are never satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s right, hand.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Oh, now, baby…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Your ball, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Is this suppose to be fun?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Go on, get up there…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: … and stay relaxed this time.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now don’t loft it, just release it like I
told you.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: The ball’s too heavy for me, honey…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s not the damn ball.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m tryin’, baby, so don’t start gettin’
mad now.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I’m not mad at you, hand. It’ll be all
right. Just spot and follow through…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nice ball, El.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Id’n he somethin’ to see?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Is it my turn again?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Right. Now show me a little somethin’ this
time, okay? Give me some form…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I can’t help it, honey, the ball just keeps
goin’ cocky wobbly on me…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will you just do what the hell I tell
you…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I did, didn’ I, El?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You got another ball comin’.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Atta boy, Ray!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: That was damn good, wad’n it? I finally did
it…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, great. Why don’t you throw Z’s for 19
frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a
losing game? Just wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wasn’t it, ladies?</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: Are you talking to us?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m gonna go wait in the car.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, why don’t you do that.</p>
<p><strong>stoney</strong>: Wait an I’ll I go with you, honey…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: We gotta get on home an’ relieve the sitter.
Why’nt you an’ Ray come on over.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay. Go ahead. I’ll settle up for the beers…
An’ walk Rayette over with you, will you.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Can I get you anything else?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No. How much do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Five’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: We been wantin’ to ask you something. Are
you the guy on YV?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Am I on TV?</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: She says you’re the one that sells all the
cars on TV.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I don’t claim to have sold ’em all.
They still have some left, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: See, I told you it was him… Your name’s
Donnie something, right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I leave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty,
and her name’s Twinky.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Twinky?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, ’cause she’s so “twinky”…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice
talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s a wig you wear, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: A wig?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you’re
wearing a wig, ’cause on TV you’re mostly bald in the front.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Your little friend’s real sharp there… Yeah,
I don’t like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million
people watching you, you’ve gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it
when I’m out slippin’ around bowling alleys an’ things like that. I
think it gives me a little more class, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: Oh, definitely…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, but I can see a little bitty of the net
up there, that’s what give it away.</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: It’s so weird to see you in person, but
that’s who she says you are.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It is him, he said it’s him. Aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, you could say it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: I’m gonna give you our number, Donnie, just
in case… We’re both professionals, if you didn’t guess.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, you seem very professional…</p>
<p><strong>twinky</strong>: I always tell everyone the same thing. I got
rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it’s two for one,
an’ I work strictly in tandem with Betty…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I can see how she’d come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on. We’re goin’ over to Elton’s.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You just going to sit there?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay. Hope no one hits on you.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I hope they do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: See you later, then…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No one would want to hit on you, you look too
pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good
time.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You’re the pathetic one, not me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m going on over there…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m not some piece a crap.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You treat me like I was.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You go slippin’ around in front a my face,
an’ in front a Elton an’ Stoney. What do you imagine they think a
someone you treat that way…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now, hand…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you.
An’ they’re just goin’ to think I’m not too nice a guy, which I’m not,
an’ that you’re a hell of a person puttin’ up with me, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You’re goin’ a find me dead one time.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sssh, come on now… Be a good girl.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: If you really want a get up an’ leave me,
you can read about it in the newsprint.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not going to get up an’ leave you. Now
let’s go over to El’s an’ have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Do you love me, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well now, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: God, id’n she the cutest damn thing in your
life!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can you believe this shit?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goddamned freeway… Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Give ’em the horn, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look at these assholes! What the hell are
they doing?!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t take this shit anymore.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, get off my car!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Where the hell’s he goin’?</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Hey, Bob! Come on! Quit foolin’ around!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Shit, what’s he doin’?</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: You better get your butt off there, Bob! Come
on, now!!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I was with Elton last night, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Rayette…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: I swore to God I’d never hire on to this type
a work again. Christ, I don’t know how the hell I let you talk me into
it…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Give me a swig, hon’.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: You didn’ know I was a derrickman once, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Down in the southern fields, an’ man, did I
hate it. An’ Stoney’s brother was a well-puller, wad’n he, honey? The
one with three fingers?</p>
<p><strong>stoney</strong>: My brother Cruser, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: I once hung suspendered 90 feet up on a tour,
like a damn circus artist…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Honey, took at this little bugger.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Near broke my damn neck…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Id’n he the cutest little guy?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Very cute… Put it down, an’ let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: You know, you oughta get you one them things,
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah… An’ I oughta live in a trailer park
with my front teeth poked out…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Well, what if she was, Bob? I can’t see
nothin’ so bad in it…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: What if I was to let you in on the little
fact that she is.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: That’s right. She told me. An’ she’s all tore
up about it, which I hate a see.</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Hell, id’n it just somethin’ to face up to?
I’ll tell you, somewhere along the line, you even get to likin’ the
whole idea…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: I recall when Stoney first give me the news,
I could a shit…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Well, id’n that nice.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s ridiculous! I’m sitting here, listening
to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just keep telling me about the good life,
Elton, if you want a see me puke my lunch!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: If you’re sayin’ you’re somethin’ better’n
what I am, that’s one thing. But I can’t say much a someone who’d run
off an’ leave a woman in a situation like this an’ feel easy about it.
An’ that’s all I gotta say.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I hope that’s all you gotta say, El, ‘cause
I’m about as tired of your mouth as I am workin’ this stinkin’ hole!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Shit ass!!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, Longcipher! I’m quitting!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Longcipher! I’m talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Did you hear me?! I said I’m quitting!</p>
<p><strong>driller</strong>: I don’t give a shit what you do. You ben
more trouble than you’re worth, an’ I’m damn glad to be rid of both a
you assholes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey! What’s goin’ on?!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Don’t do that, Bob!! It’s the Law!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: It’s the Law, Bob, don’t mix in!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Look out behind!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Hey, don’t do that. Don’t you think you could
just leave him…</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: Sure as hell he wouldn’ a done that if he’d
known who you was… Would you, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Christ Almighty, what’s happening here?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Okay, let him go.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tell me what in the hell’s going on,
Elton!</p>
<p><strong>elton</strong>: I got accused a robbin’ a fillin’station down

<p><strong>second man</strong>: Come on.</p>

<p><strong>elton</strong>: Tell Stoney for me, will you?! Tell her to

<p><strong>twinky</strong>: Donnie, oh Donnie…</p>
<p><strong>first engineer</strong>: There she goes again.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: My 1-year-old can carry a tune
better than that.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: Miss Dupea.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: Miss Dupea.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: I’d like to remind you again, this
isn’t an opera or a musical comedy.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh… I’m sorry. Was I singing again?</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: If you want to call it that.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Well, you have to simply tell me, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: That’s exactly what I am doing,
again.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Do you have to let me get halfway through the
movement first? This is tiring me.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: I have a suggestion. Why don’t we
take a break.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh, for pity’s sake…</p>
<p><strong>first engineer</strong>: Is she going to cry again?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I don’t want to take a break.</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: What would you like in your
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Tea.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Would you tell her Bobby’s here?</p>
<p><strong>second engineer</strong>: Miss Dupea, Bobby’s here.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh my goodness… Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi, Tita.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Robert Eroica…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now don’t…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: No, I’m not… I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I just can’t look at you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t, then.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: You always do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I don’t mean to. Here’s your tea,
Tita.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Thank you… Oh no, don’t put it on there…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: This is a very special, very old CB 275…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: You know who it once belonged to?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: It has absolutely no objectionable
idiosyncrasies…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Robert…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I have to talk seriously with you…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Everybody still up on the Island?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Well, Herbert’s mostly on the mainland because
of the orchestra, so at the moment, there’s just Daddy, Carl and myself…
and Van Oost.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s Van Oost?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Catherine – she’s a pianist. She’s working
with Carl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Carl’s a fiddler. What’s he doing coaching
piano?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on
his way to the post office in La Roche… and he ran into a Jeep and
sprained his neck…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sprained his neck?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: It’s not funny. He permanently sprained his
neck, and since then it’s been extremely difficult for him to tuck the
violin.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.
That’s Carl…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Robert, I have to tell you something…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Daddy’s very ill.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, well, what, what’s he…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: He’s had two strokes.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: He’s not… They feel he… maybe he might not
recover, and that he’ll either…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t tell me about this…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: But don’t you think it’s right, though, that
you should see him, at least once…</p>
<p><strong>second engineer’s voice</strong>: We’re ready Miss Dupea.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Just a minute, please! Robert, don’t you think
it’s right that you should see him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah… I guess so…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I’m going back up tonight. Will you go with
me?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’d rather drive up myself and… maybe go into
Canada after… And I can’t stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the
most.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well… I better let you…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I’ll walk out with you…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I’ll be back in two minutes!</p>
<p><strong>second engineer’s voice</strong>: Cut that in half, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: They hate me, I feel.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe you better stay, then.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: No, I need to talk to you, about so many
things…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I’ll be seeing you in a couple of days,
won’t I?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh God, I’m so glad, Robert, that you’re
coming…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, me, too…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: It’ll be so good for you, and for Daddy,
because you know, you’ve never really…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tita, I’ve got to go…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You have the day off?!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You heard about Elton, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay, I get your point.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hope you didn’t strain yourself, getting in
here and into your pose before I hit the door.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have to go home. My father’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, it’s very funny.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll be gone two or three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You’ll be gone, period.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll try and call you from up there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on, DiPesto. I never told you it would
work out to anything. Did</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll send you some money, that’s all I can
do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And… I’ll call you, like I said… Bye,
Ray.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Do you want to go with me, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “There’s been hot spells/An’ cold spells
ever since we met/I’ve seen your small fires/Your big fires/But I won’t
give up yet/Oh someday you’ll yearn/’Cause your heart’s gonna burn/For
that old familiar glow/You’ll be burned…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “You’ll be burned out/Or smoked out/An’
come back to me, I know…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Every trail that you blaze/Makes me…”</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Is it an accident?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey! What’s going on, what’s the
trouble?!</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Rotate, mack!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: What’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought
it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on
me!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re lucky no one was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I’d
like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a
lift?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Come on, Terry, we got a ride!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Jesus, what a rude person…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Palm Apodaca.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: An’ what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Terry Grouse.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’ll tell you… … l-a-t-e-r.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: How far are you going to?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Washington.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: We’ll get off in Washington and hook another
ride.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Alaska? Are you on vacation?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She wants to live there, because she thinks
it’s cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cleaner than what?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: You don’t have to tell everybody about it.
Pretty soon they’ll all go there and it won’t be so clean.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How do you know it’s clean?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean.
It appeared to look very white to me… Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. That’s before the big thaw.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Before the what?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: I had to leave this place. I got depressed,
seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they’re making more crap, you
know? They’ve got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I
can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Who? People, that’s who! Pretty soon there
won’t be room for anyone. They’re selling more crap that people go and
buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a
big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: There’d never be a hole big enough. Now
took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I
had so much garbage collectin’ onto me every day, I was thinkin’ about
gettin a dispose all…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: A dispose-all, what’s that but more crap? I’ve
never seen such crap. Oofh, I don’t know how people get up in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Mass production is what does it.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: What do you mean “mass”… I have to come out
and tell you, you’re not that clean, either.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wait a minute. I’m not that neat, maybe, but
I am clean.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Well, you’re not that bad, but some people… I
mean, people’s homes, just filth. I’ve been in people’s homes…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: In my personal observation, I think that more
people are neat than are clean…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: In my personal thing, I don’t see that. I’m
seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no,
once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And
uh… can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and
they had a pot outside, with…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, it could be adorable…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn’t be
filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: … they oughta be erased! All those signs,
selling crap, and more crap, and, I don’t know, it’s disgusting, I don’t
even want to talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: It’s just filthy. People are dirty. I think
that’s the biggest thing that’s wrong with people. I think they wouldn’t
be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn’t have
anybody to pick on… Oofh… Dirt…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Not dirt. See, dirt isn’t bad. It’s filth.
Filth is bad. That’s what starts maggots and riots…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Hey, follow that truck. They know the best
places to stop.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: That’s an old maid’s tale.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating
places on the road.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you’d
ever waitressed, honey, you’d know.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Don’t call me “honey,” mack.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Don’t call me “mack,” honey.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: I wouldn’t be a waitress. They’re nasty and
full of crap.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You better hold onto your tongue!</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Hold onto this.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Just one minute, you! Don’t you ever talk
to me like that!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shut up! All of you!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll have an omelette, no potatoes. Give me
tomatoes instead, and wheat toast instead of rolls.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No substitutions.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What does that mean? You don’t have any
tomatoes?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No. We have tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: But I can’t have any. Is that what you
mean?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Only what’s on the menu… A Number Two:
Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I know what it comes with, but that’s not
what I want.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’ll come back when you’ve made up your
mind…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wait, I’ve made up my mind. I want a plain
omelette, forget the tomatoes, don’t put potatoes on the plate, and give
me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’m sorry, we don’t have side orders of
toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you mean, you don’t have side orders
of toast? You make sandwiches, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Would you like to talk to the manager?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Hey, mack!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shut up. You have bread, don’t you, and a
toaster of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay, I’ll make it as easy for you as I can.
Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast
– no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce – and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: One Number Two, and a chicken sal san –
hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce – and a cup of coffee… Anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Now all you have to do is hold the chicken,
bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven’t broken
any rules.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You want me to hold the chicken.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. I want you to hold it between your
knees.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You see that sign, sir?!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You’ll all have to leave, I’m not taking
any more of your smartness and your sarcasm!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You see this sign?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Fantastic! That you could figure all that out,
and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your
toast.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I didn’t get it, did I?</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: No, but it was very clever… I would of just
punched her out.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: People… Oofh… Animals are not like that…
They’re always cleaning themselves. Did you ever see… What are they
called? Pigeons!</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: He’s always picking on himself and his
friends. They’re always picking bugs out of their hair…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Monkeys, too.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Except monkeys do things out in the open that
I don’t go for.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: I was in this place once, this store, with
snakes, monkeys, everything you could imagine. I walked in, I had to run
out. It stunk! They didn’t even have an incense going…</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: And you know, I read where they invented this
car that runs on… that runs on… when you boil water…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Steam.</p>
<p><strong>palm</strong>: Right, steam. A car you could ride around in
and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have
it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote
them a note once, and told them to clean it… I mean, don’t you see that?
It’s just filthy! I mean, I’ve seen filth you wouldn’t believe! Oofh,
what a stink! I don’t even want to talk about it…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Are you depressed about your daddy,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I ’magine it’s me then, id’n it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is what you?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You’re depressed that I come along.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who said I was depressed?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, is that a happy face I see?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: ’Cause if it was me, I could just catch a
Greyhound back.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, you’re not going to kill yourself this
time. I wish I’d known…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to sleep
or not.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Hint, hint.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I guess I’ll just have to count the sheep.
One-two-three-four…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Seven… eight… Look at this old cold
shoulder, what am I gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If you just wouldn’t open your mouth,
everything would be fine.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Tick a lock.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Why can’t I go out to your folks’ house?
Give me one good reason.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have to see how things are first. My
father’s sick, you understand? They wouldn’t be prepared for me bringing
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: So how long am I supposed to sit an’
twiddle my thumbs in this place?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: If you can’t do what I ask, Ray, use that
money to go back home, then.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Bobby, don’t talk like that…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: It’ll be all right, I’ll get a hold a some
magazines an’ things like that. An’ maybe find a beauty salon an’ get my
hair fixed, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay, Ray…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Or maybe sit out by the pool an’ get myself
nice an’ tan for you. Would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: It brings out my eyes…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bye, honey, I’ll call you in a couple of
days.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Bye, baby…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: He doesn’t even know who the hell I am.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Remember, Bobby, what mother used to say
when…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: How long have you been… Oh, excuse
me…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: No, it’s all right, you go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I was just going to ask Robert how long
he’s been away from here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Four or five years.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, the last time was three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh no, it’s been much more than that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense
of time at all.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I don’t think that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It is true.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Besides being very rude.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What have you been doing since then?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What have I been doing? Different things,
different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: And you no longer play at all?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You know, just after I came back off tour with
the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit
conference about you…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh, my, “a summit conference.” I wonder where
I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know where you were, penis envy.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I hope I didn’t hear that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private
detective to ferret you out, and I said, “What for?” Whatever the hell
he’s doing, even if it’s a completely wasteful escapade, it’s entirely
his business. Simple as that…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I don’t think you should infer Daddy was wrong
in front of him…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Don’t force him like that, Spicer.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: How long have you been staying here?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: A couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s still nearly impossible for me to turn my
neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I’d first have
to twist the whole base of my body around… … like this…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wouldn’t mind doing a little work, if
you’re finished, and not too tired…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, I’m finished… Satiety is my father and
mother.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: She’s tremendously gifted, this girl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is she?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Excuse me, I don’t want to hear this…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I hope you feel at home, Robert. I’m really
glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thanks, Carl…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can
tell when he’s expressing approval or disapproval, just from his
eyes…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Uhm hmm. Some range.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: It’s not that bad.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes, it is. I can’t take seeing him, sitting
there like a stone.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: A week or two isn’t going to ruin your life,
for Godsakes.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I mean, you think I’m that happy?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I don’t. You should’ve left a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: We can’t all get up and leave, can we? I mean,
there are certain needs you have to respond to…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: And anyway, I want you to stay, so I can spend
some time with you, and ask you some questions…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What questions?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Well, do you – I mean, have you enjoyed all
these… strange things you’ve been doing?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or
something?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: No, no, I don’t think that, I’m just curious
about it… Do you think I’m a freak?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh no… Why? What is it? The way I look?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I don’t really think you’re a freak.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I probably am, but I don’t care. I mean, I
wasn’t that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to
make any improvements…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just
coaching her, or what?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up
before the birds, I can’t get in any practice time for myself…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Uhm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Actually, it’s very admirable, the way she
works. She’ll probably be enormously successful, because she’s
attractive as well, not that that’s so important in music, but…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re attractive, Tita. If you just did a
little more with yourself…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, if you just maybe did something with
your hair, or…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh, let’s not talk about my hair, it does what
it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: There’s nothing to say, Tita…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Well, you’re not going to run out on me right
away, are you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh God, don’t sneak up on me like that!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I guess you fell in the water.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes, intentionally.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s dangerous, you know.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Swimming?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Playing piano all day and then jumping into
cold water. You could get a cramp.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I love to swim, and I don’t mind the cold
at all. It’s invigorating.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t want to get too invigorated
myself.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What would I do with it? Run amok?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Besides piano and swimming, what else do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Well, there’s fishing and boating.
There’s concerts on the mainland and… but I feel silly telling you. This
is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to
do.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Nothing? Then it must be very boring for
you here.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s right. Have you anything to
suggest?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t know. Let me give it some
thought.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’re you doing right now…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Right now I’m going to run a hot tub and
soak myself.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Then after that?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: After that, I plan to read some music and
rest for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tomorrow, then.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Tomorrow’s a full practice day… But the
day after is kind of open.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The day after tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: If you’re free.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I’ll probably be free.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Don’t laugh…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: What’s wrong, Carl, you hardly ate
anything…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I took some aspirin and it really upset my
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: One thing that’s hard to understand is
how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just
walk away from it, without a second thought…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I gave it a second thought.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: He looks tired to me, Spicer. I think you
should put him to bed.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I mean, how could you not play anymore?
That’s so strange to me…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have played a few times. Here and there. As
a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical
revue.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You don’t call that music, though.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Of course I do. It’s music. You know…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Robert, do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: We really don’t have to, Carl, if you’re
not feeling good…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, maybe if we put the Thermaphore on me
for a while, first…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Do you want some gingerbread?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: With applesauce?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, well fine, you know what I suggest,
Ray… Because I don’t know how long. Things are not going that well
here…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, well I’m not having any fun, either, so
why don’t you… No, you can’t, it’s just not convenient, and I have to
get off… Ray, I really have to go, I have to get off now… Another couple
of days, maybe. I’ll call you and let you – All right, if you’re gone,
you’re gone. Now I have to get off, okay? Bye, Ray…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Only 10 minutes of playing and it’s already
killing my neck…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You sure you should be playing, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I’m in
superb shape.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know, there’s something wrong with
the way you move.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not aware of it. Like what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Your serve. Two – Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’d hate to see you walk across a concert
stage like that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Two – Nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ve walked across a stage a number of times,
without exciting any particular response…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s what I mean…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Any particular humor, I meant.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think you should get someone to coach you
how to walk. I think it’s a substantial problem.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Why are you being so mean?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not. He does walk funny. Don’t you see
that?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I don’t think I’d notice. I’m so used to
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, well, he’s…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Bobby? Do you think Spicer is attractive?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I think he’s got a terrific personality.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: You know, he was formerly a sailor.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Look, can’t you see that, what I’m talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Sailors are sadistic, I feel.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: See? There’s nothing wrong with the way I
walk. Now where are we?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: At game, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s three games to none, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: All right, let’s have a rematch.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I thought you had to go to the mainland
today. Aren’t you going to miss the ferry?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Too bad. Just when I was hitting my
stride.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Say goodbye to Catherine for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Can I play now?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Tell her I’ll be back sometime tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where is she, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: My turn.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Why don’t you and Spicer play?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That was beautiful, Robert. I’m
surprised…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I was really very moved by the way
you…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It wasn’t supposed to be, it just struck me
that way.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Nothing. It’s just that… I picked the easiest
piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old
and I played it better then.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It doesn’t matter. It was the feeling I
was affected by.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I didn’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You had no inner feeling?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Then I must have been supplying it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Well, at least you’re accomplished at
something…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: At being a fake.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Catherine…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, you’re very good at it. I’m really
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You think I’m a fake.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I think it’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, it isn’t what I think.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Look… You made a very calculated move,
and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn’t
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes, it was. You’ve made it clear that if I
can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t think that’s accurate…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Up to now, what I’ve been getting from you
are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague
suggestions about the day after tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m not conscious of having given you any
meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day
after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you… Now if you’ll
excuse me, I’d like to take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s convenient to fake looking for something
right now, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m not faking anything. I’m looking for
some bath oil…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Some bath oil?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What about this one? Or this one? How about
some jasmine? What about some musk?</p>
<p><strong>cathfrine</strong>: What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What are you doing, screwing around with this
crap?!</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t find your language that
charming.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s direct, anyway, which seems to be
difficult for you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d like you to leave now. Is that direct
enough?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re not a serious person, by your own
admission. And that may be interesting, but it doesn’t interest me…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Serious, that’s what’s important to you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes, that’s what’s important to me…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay, let’s be serious…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, don’t do that…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shut up…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No inner feeling.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t believe vou.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I married him when I was 17. He was a
cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I’d ever met… And
I’m sure he was, because at that age, I hadn’t met that many… But he was
insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity,
musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely
imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren’t even sure he was doing
it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something
Joseph, you’re full of beans, and I left him…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s what you said?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Something witty and devastating like
that.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: As a matter of fact, he’s the one who
introduced me to Carl… How are you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Carl restored my confidence. He really
did. He’s much more substantial than you give him credit for.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is he?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you think you could discreetly move
across the hall now?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, I think I could.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Robert?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I could spend some time with you tomorrow
morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you’d like to.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Of course I’d like to.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You certainly do have a beautiful piece a
real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Can he hear me?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: He’s not hard of hearing.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, that’s a blessing, at least.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: This certainly is an improvement on the
motel an’ the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful
place, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’ve been staying in a motel all this
time?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: For two whole weeks, an’ there wasn’t
hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me
it was the off season, an’ it must a ben, because other’n me, there was
just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn’t appear to be all there,
an’ this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin’ for
quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an’ them,
hollerin’ away…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t understand why you had to stay in a
motel. There’s more than enough room here.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, I was goin’ to, but Bobby said he
hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but
then it went an’ took so long, I ran flat outa money… I didn’t have no
number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an’ come on up
here, in the hopes that I wouldn’t be intrudin’ myself…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, no. You’re more than welcome.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, thank you, that’s a very nice thing
for you to say.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: That certainly is a beautiful head a hair
you have.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Is it natural?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Rayette.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just finish eating.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Oh, am I holdin’ up dessert?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, you’re not. Go ahead and take your
time.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can
put it away like a speed swing… Is there any ketchup around?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, for chrissakes…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Robert, let’s not be rude, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: It’s all right. He don’t mean anything by
that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I guess Bobby’s just about the moodiest man
I ever ben with…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m going to pick up some friends of
Carl’s. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ll be back later…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I want to talk to you now. I have to
explain something about…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, you don’t have to, it isn’t
necessary…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes, it is!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Come on, get moving, dammit!!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will you shut up for a minute!! Pull your car
out of line.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Will you let me talk to you, please?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I can’t do that. I haven’t been being
fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh. You have to tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What?! I can’t hear you!</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m sorry everything’s been so confusing,
but I have to go, Robert…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Catherine…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Please, I’ll see you later this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: But the point is, man is born into the world
with a pre-existent adversary, both real and imaginary, so you’d have to
say that aggression was one of his primary, psychic inheritances,
which…</p>
<p><strong>fincher</strong>: If I may beg to differ…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Beg all you like, John, but the fact remains
that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts, as well as the
portrayal of aggressive acts, and to be triumphant over another no
matter how, seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being, as
well as…</p>
<p><strong>fincher</strong>: No, I don’t quarrel with your inference,
but you draw too long a bow in your conclusions, which seem
unnecessarily harsh and…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Well, I don’t make poetry. As an analyst,
I…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Is there a TV in the house?</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: John believes in the basic goodness of man,
and that’s fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a
little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the
real world…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: There’s some good things on it, though.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: The TV. There’s some good things on it,
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: I strongly doubt it, but I wasn’t really
discussing media…</p>
<p><strong>fincher</strong>: If you really hold such bleak views, how
can you, in good conscience, carry on a practice?</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Oh, there’s always hope, I think, for a few
individuals, if they’re courageous enough to shed their illusions and
their…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: And what about love?</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: What about it? Wouldn’t you agree that a
great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Well, you’re a romantic, Catherine, as are
most musicians, and what’s more, about to be married…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: … which should exclude you from any objective
discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren’t free of aggressive
content, nor the institution of marriage.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I think these cold, “objective”
discussions are aggressive, Samia…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: But I’d like to say, so that I don’t dampen
the spirit of your adventure…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You haven’t dampened my spirit, Samia…
Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Well, I should hope not…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Because obviously there are loftier classes
of people that do establish a kind of relating, that’s relatively free
of…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: What kind of doggy is that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s a Borzoi.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once,
that Bobby give me…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Remember, Bobby?! The little pussycat you
gave me?!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: She had four little white paws, an’ oh, was
I crazy over her. We hadda go an’ leave her one time at some friends,
an’ she went out an’ got smashed flatter’n a tortilla right outside
their mobile home.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: There. You see what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: The choice of words, “squashed flat,”
juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Well, she was.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Perhaps…</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: But you see how close that is to what I’m
trying to…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t sit there pointing at her.</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I said, don’t point at her like that! What
gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who
the hell’s got it, and what she typifies! You shouldn’t even be in the
same room with her, you creep!</p>
<p><strong>samia</strong>: Carl, this is really too much…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re totally full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Robert, I think you better just…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re all full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Bobby…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t talk to you right now, leave me
alone…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tita, what the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Hey, this is my room.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’s going on here!?</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: It’s none of your business!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where’s Catherine?!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: I don’t know where she is!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Don’t you believe in knocking, pal?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m talking to you, Tita!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Can’t I have anything to myself, dammit?!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Come on now, out!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Keep your fucking hands off my sister,
nurse!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Did you hear me! Move out!!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop! I mean
it!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Hold it, just hold it!!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Carl! Somebody get Carl!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Take it easy, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!! Carl!!</p>
<p><strong>spicer</strong>: Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
Give up!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Oh God, Bobby, look what you’ve done…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I just wanted to talk to you for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. It’s useless, Robert. It wouldn’t
work, not ever…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Just give me a chance, will you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m trying to be delicate with you, but
you’re not understanding me. It’s not just because of Carl, or my music,
but because of you… I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no
love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his
friends, something… How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why
should he ask for it?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And living out here, in this rest home
asylum, that’s what you want?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’ll make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I hope it will, yes. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know if you’d be particularly
interested in hearing anything about me. My life, I mean… Most of it
doesn’t add up to much… that I could relate as a way of life that you’d
approve of…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’d like to be able to tell you why, but I
don’t really… I mean, I move around a lot because things tend to get bad
when I stay. And I’m looking… for auspicious beginnings, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m trying to, you know, imagine your half of
this conversation… My feeling is, that if you could talk, we probably
wouldn’t be talking. That’s pretty much how it got to be before. I left…
Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I don’t know what to say…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Tita suggested that we try to… I don’t know.
I think that she… seems to feel we’ve got… some understanding to reach…
She totally denies the fact that we were never that comfortable with
each other to begin with… The best I can do, is apologize.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We both know I was never really that good at
it, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m sorry it didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah. I said a week, and I’ve overstayed
myself…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: You were going without saying goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I didn’t want to say goodbye to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: But what about me?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll say goodbye to you, Tita.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Just once in a while, call and tell me where
you are, please…</p>
<p><strong>rayette’s voice</strong>: Watch the birdie!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bye, now.</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Bye, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture
of you an’ me in front of the place…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I never got the chance to thank you all for
your hospitality. You tell Carl for me, if any of you folks wanta come
on down to our place anytime, you’d be more’n welcome…</p>
<p><strong>tita</strong>: Thank you, that’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Bye bye, now.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Your kiss is like a drink when I’m
thirsty/An’ I’m thirsty for you with all my heart…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “But don’t love me/Then act as though we’ve
never kissed/Oh, don’t touch me…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Don’t touch me…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Don’t touch me…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Don’t touch me…”</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: “Oh, don’t touch…”</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Son of a bitch, Bobby! You quit pushin’ me
away like that! I’ve had enough a that to last me a lifetime!</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Whyn’t you just try an’ be good to me for a
change!?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: There id’n anyone gonna look after you an’
love you better’n I do, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Baby? Did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: I’m gonna go in that cafe an’ get some
coffee. You want anything?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: You got any change?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Don’t you just have 50 cents or
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Okay, be right back…</p>
<p><strong>rayette</strong>: Sure you don’t want anything?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Fill it up.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Haven’t you got a jacket or anything with
you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I don’t, I uh… it got burned up.
Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is
what I have on…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’ve got an extra jacket behind the seat, if
you want to put it on.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Suit yourself. But I’ll tell you, where
we’re headed is gonna get colder’n hell.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s all right. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
