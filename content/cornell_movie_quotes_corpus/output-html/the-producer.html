<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll kiss it and make

<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ll wait in the hall …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oooooooops!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ooooooops.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: I can’t abide a peeping Tom.
There’s one in the apartment just opposite my bedroom window. I swear
that man NEVER takes his field glasses off me for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Good. Let’s fool around. Now, I’ll
be the innocent little milk maid and you’ll be the naughty stable boy.
Oh, this milk is so heavy. I’ll never reach the house. Help. Will
someone help me?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Wait. Wait. We can’t play today. I have
too many appointments.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: We can’t play today?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thursday. Thursday. We’ll play Thursday.
We’ll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Oh, the best one.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Oh, Bialy, please, just a little.
Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: So, the Count hired you this
morning, Rudolfo … Watch the road … Watch the road.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I can’t take my eyes off you. How can I
drive when you drive me mad. Mad.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Rudolfo, you dirty pig! Pull
over.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Good. That’s enough. We’ll do the rest
on Thursday. That’s a good girl. It’s always such fun to see you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Until Thursday, then, you bawdy
wench.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch
me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thursday. I’ll see you Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: And we’ll finish playing the
Contessa and Rudolfo.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Good. Yes. Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: And after that we’ll play the
Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia … And I’ll play Lucretia.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Oh, Thursday. Will Thursday ever
come?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: I shall count the minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Goodbye, my angel … My angel! Hey, touch
me … wait! Hey, uh … Lucretia, Lucretia!</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Yes???</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the
check. Can’t produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Of course, the check, I had it with
me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: I don’t know what’s happening to
me. I must be getting old.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Is it all right? I made it out to
cash. You didn’t tell me the name of the play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh, it’s fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall
count the minutes.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady</strong>: Ta. Ta.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Ta. Ta.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: He who signs a lease, must pay rent.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: That’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Murderer! Thief! How can you take the
last penny out of a man’s pocket?</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: I have to … I’m a landlord!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oh Lord, hear my plea. Destroy him. He
maketh a blight on the land.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Don’t pay attention. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nnnnn. That hurt. I’ll have to make
another call.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Have you been there all this time?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: And did you see and hear everything?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then what do you have to say for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Uh … uh … ooooooops?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Who are you? What do you want? Why are
you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don’t you
speak?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Scared. Can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take
a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Words tumble from his</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Caught you with the old lady.” Come in,
Mr. Tact.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: So you’re an accountant, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then account for yourself! Do you
believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old
lady’s dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sir, I …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Never mind. Never mind. Do the books.
They’re in that desk over there. Top drawer.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How dare you condemn me without knowing
all the facts.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But sir, I’m not condem …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up. I’m having a rhetorical
conversation. How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You know who I used to be? Max
Bialystock! The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once. Lunch at
Delmonico’s. Two hundred dollar suits. Look at me. Look at me now! I’m
wearing a cardboard belt!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I used to have thousands of investors
begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock
production.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Look at my investors now. Voila!
Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock’s office to
grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You have exactly ten seconds to change
that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One … Two
…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Do the books! Do the books!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Window’s so filthy, can’t tell if it’s
day or night out there.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Look at that. A white Rolls Royce.
That’s it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Koff, koff … ahem, ahem … harrumph …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I assume you are making those cartoon
noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you
fish-faced enemy of the people?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I have hurt your feelings.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Good, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, sir, it seems …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You have forty-eight seconds left.
Hurry. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: In looking at your books, I’ve discovered
that …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,
you’re using up your time.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function under these
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re making me extremely nervous.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What is that? A handkerchief?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s nothing … nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: If it’s nothing, why can’t I see it?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Here, don’t panic.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m sorry … I don’t like people touching my
blue blanket. It’s not important. It’s a minor compulsion. I can deal
with it if I want to. It’s just that I’ve had it ever since I was a baby
and … and … I find it very comforting.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They come here. They all come here. How
do they find me?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Bialystock …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is hardly a time for levity. I’ve
discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Where? What?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: According to the backer’s list you raised
$60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.
There’s two thousand dollars unaccounted for.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The
show was a flop. What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It makes a great deal of difference. That’s
fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Why should they find out? It’s only two
thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points
around. You can do it. You’re an accountant. The word ‘count’ is part of
your title.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But that’s cheating!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s not cheating … It’s charity. Bloom,
look at me … look at me! I’m drowning. Other men sail through life.
Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I’m going under. I am being sunk by
a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom,
I’m reaching out to you. Don’t send me to jail. Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: All right. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con
you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, it’s all right … wha?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Now let’s see, two thousand dollars. That
isn’t much. I’m sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department
of internal revenue isn’t interested in a show that flopped.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it
out. I’m tired. I’m gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there’s a
fire.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Now let’s see, if we add these figures, we
get …</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It’s absolutely
amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more
money with a flop than he could with a hit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes. Yes. It’s quite possible. If he were
certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes???</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, what?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What you were saying. Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You were saying that under the right
circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he
could with a hit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes, it’s quite possible.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You keep saying that, but you don’t tell
me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a
hit?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s simply a matter of creative accounting.
Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Assume away!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, it’s very easy. You simply raise more
money than you really need.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’ve done it yourself, only you did it on a
very small scale.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You raised two thousand more than you needed
to produce your last play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: So what? What did it get me? I’m wearing
a cardboard belt.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ahhhhhh! But that’s where you made your
error. You didn’t go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold
criminal, you could have raised a million.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: But the play only cost $60,000 to
produce.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Exactly. And how long did it run?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: One night.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: See? You could have raised a million dollars,
put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: But what if the play was a hit?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, you’d go to jail. If the play were a hit,
you’d have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could
never be enough profits to go around, get it?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in
order for the scheme to work, we’d have to find a sure fire flop.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What scheme?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody
little genius.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely
posed a little, academic accounting theory. It’s just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bloom, worlds are turned on such
thoughts!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Don’t you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom,
glorious Bloom, it’s so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the
world – a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars – there’s a lot
of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on
the books. Phoney lists of backers – one for the government, one for us.
You can do it, Bloom, you’re a wizard.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Step four: We open on Broadway and
before you can say ‘step five’ we close on Broadway. Step six: We take
our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo
…”</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: scheme, afraid of the</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No, Bloom, you don’t understand. This is
fate, this is destiny. There’s no avoiding it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: practically touching</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh, I fell on my keys. I’ve got to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You miserable, cowardly, wretched little
caterpillar. Don’t you ever want to become a butterfly? Don’t you want
to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re going to jump on me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re going to jump on me. I know you’re
going to jump on me – like Nero jumped on Poppea.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Poppea. She was his wife. And she was
unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up
and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don’t jump on me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I’m not going to jump on you!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Will you get a hold on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you afraid of? I’m not going to
hurt you! What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m hysterical. I’m having hysterics. I’m
hysterical. I can’t stop. When I get like this, I can’t stop. I’m
hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m wet! I’m wet! I’m hysterical and I’m
wet!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m in pain! And I’m wet! And I’m still
hysterical!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No! No! Don’t hit. It doesn’t help. It only
increases my sense of danger.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What can I do? What can I do? You’re
getting me hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Go away from me. You frighten me. Sit over
there.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Okay. I’m way over here. Is that
better?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s a little better, but you still look
angry.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Good. Good. That’s nice. That’s very nice. I
think I’m coming out of it now. Yes. Yes. I’m definitely coming out of
it. Thank you for smiling. It helped a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Well, you know what they say, “Smile and
the world smiles with you.” Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight
jacket. Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Much, thank you. But I am a little
lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something. Hysterics have a way of
severely depleting one’s blood sugar, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They certainly do. They certainly do.
Come, let me take you to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but
I …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I
lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: And I promise you faithfully, I won’t
discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Avanti!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Je vous empris.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: My hat.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Murray, I’m going to lunch. I took two
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>murray the blindman</strong>: Okay, Bialy, that makes six
eighty you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I know. Don’t worry. You’ll get it.
You’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>murray the blindman</strong>: Well, don’t forget about it. I
need it. Nobody understands. I’m competing with giants. The Greater New
York Fund. The March of Dimes. The Community Chest. They’re driving me
out of business.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I got it, Mr. Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You
know, I don’t let everybody call me Max. It’s only people I really
like.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Okay … Max! And you can call me Leo.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I already have. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Where would you like to eat?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, Max, I don’t know, Max. What do you
think, Max?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Let me see … it’s such a beautiful day.
Why waste it indoors. I’ve got it! Let’s go to Coney Island! We’ll lunch
at the sea shore.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Coney Island??</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What’s the matter, Leo? Don’t you like
Coney Island?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I … I love it. I haven’t been there since I
was a kid. But it’s nearly two o’clock. I really should be getting back
to Whitehall and Marks.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks
are concerned, you’re working with Bialystock, right?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Then stick with Bialystock!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We’ll have another round.</p>
<p><strong>custard man</strong>: What kind now, sports?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What kind now, Leo?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t know. Let’s see. We’ve had chocolate,
vanilla, banana - let’s go green.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Two pistachios, my good man.</p>
<p><strong>custard man</strong>: I’m not your good man, I happen to own
this establishment.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Everybody’s a big shot. Well, Leo, are
you having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t know. I think so. I feel very
strange.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Maybe you’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yes. That’s it. Happy. Well, whatta ya think
of that. Happy.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I love it. I love it. Get set. We’re coming
to another turn.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bloom, it can always be like this. Life
can be beautiful. Let me show you. Stick with …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Money is honey. Money is honey. Money
can put soft things next to your skin. Silk … satin … women.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But if we’re caught, we’ll go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: marshals his forces</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m a
nothing. I spend my life counting other people’s money – people I’m
smarter than, better than. Where’s my share? Where’s Leo Bloom’s share?
I want, I want, I want, I want everything I’ve ever seen in the
movies!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Hey, we’re going up.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You bet your boots, Leo. It’s Bialystock
and Bloom – on the rise. Upward and onward. Say, you’ll join me. Nothing
can stop us.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ll do it! By God, I’ll do it!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: This is where we belong, Leo. On top of
the world. Top of the world!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Oiiiiiii!!!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ohhhhhhhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, let’s call it a night. It’s two in the
morning. I don’t know what I’m reading anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Read, read. We’ve got to find the worst
play ever written.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Hmmnn. “Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to find he had been transformed into a giant cock-a- roach.”</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s good!!!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Wait a minute, I’ve read this part. I’m
reading plays I read this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Good lord, it’s morning. Let’s face it, we’ll
never find it. Max, tomorrow’s another day. Today’s another day.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We’ll never find it, eh? We’ll never
find it, eh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You can’t smell it when it’s under your
nose. You can’t see it when it’s right before your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You can’t feel it when it’s in your
hand, when it’s in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, what is it? What are you doing? What’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s happening. We’ve
struck gold. Not fool’s gold, but real gold. The mother lode. The mother
lode. The mother of them all.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You found a flop!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: A flop, ha! That’s putting it mildly. A
disaster! A catastrophe! An outrage! A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night
beauty!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: This is freedom from want forever. This
is a house in the country. This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley. This is
wine, women and song and women.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: “SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp with
Adolph and Eva in Berchtesgarten.” Fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s practically a love letter to
Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It won’t run a week!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Run a week? Are you kidding? This play
has got to close in the first act.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Who wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>cut to author’s name on the manuscript</strong>: By FRANZ
LIEBKIND.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Here it is – 415.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Who do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Who do you want? No one gets in the building
unless I know who they want … I’m the concierge. My husband used to be
the concierge. He’s dead. Now I’m the concierge.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Oh, the kraut. He’s on the top floor.
Apartment twenty-three.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: But you won’t find him there. He’s up on the
roof with his birds. He keeps birds. Dirty, disgusting, filthy,
lice-ridden birds. You used to be able to sit out on the stoop like a
person. Not anymore. No sir. Birds! You get my drift?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: We … uh … get your drift. Thank you,
Madam.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: I’m not a madam. I’m a concierge.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Hilda, look … look good … Hilda, you’re
not looking. Hilda, if he lives, I know you will find him.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’s wearing a German helmet.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shhh. Don’t say anything to offend him.
We need that play. Franz Liebkind?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I vas never a member of the Nazi party. I
am not responsible. I only followed orders. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Mr. Liebkind, wait. You don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vhy do you persecute me? My papers are in
order. I love my country. “Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber
vaves of grain.”</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Mr. Liebkind, wait …</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: “I’m a Yankee Doodle Dandy …</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we’re not
from the government. We came here to talk to you about your play.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: My play? You mean, “Springtime For …” you
know who?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vat about it?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We loved it. We thought it was a
masterpiece. That’s why we’re here. We want to produce it on
Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: You’re not, as you Americans say, dragging
my leg, are you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No, not at all sir, we’re quite serious. We
want to produce your play. I have the contracts right here.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Oh joy of joys! Oh, dream of dreams! I
can’t believe it. Birds, birds, do you hear? Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans,
Wolfgang, do you hear? Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer’s name. Fly,
fly, spread the words.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: “Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber
alles in der velt.”</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: “Deutchland, Deutchland …”</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vat?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: People can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>oh.</strong>: “I’m a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my
…” Listen, this is not place to talk. Come!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: We go to my flat. An occasion like this
calls for Schnapps.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock. Gentleman, with
your permission, I would like to propose a toast to the greatest man
that ever lived. Let us say his name quietly to ourselves. The walls
have ears.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Adolph Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Sigmund Freud.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Max Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I vas vit him a great deal, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: With whom?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vit the Fuhrer, of course. He liked me.
Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite. I
vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot milk
and his opium. Achhh, those were the days. Vat good times ve had. Dinner
parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing. You know,
not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Really, I never dreamed …</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: That’s because you were taken in by that
verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies. But nobody said a bad
vord about Winston Churchill, did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings.
Couldn’t even say Nazi. He would say Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not
Narzies, ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, and you’re getting it
straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he
vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes,
and could dance the pants off Churchill!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: That’s exactly why we want to do this
play. To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler
you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Leo, quick, the contract.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind. And
make your dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Wait. No. How do I know I can trust you?
How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in
vhich it vas conceived?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We swear it!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Not good enough… Vould you be villing to
take the Siegfried oath?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes. We would!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Good. I will make the preparations.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, I don’t want to take any Siegfried Oath.
I don’t know what it is, but I don’t want to take it. We might end up in
the German Army.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up, you idiot. He’s a harmless nut.
Play along with him. It’s almost in the bag.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Please to don your helmets.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Please to light your candles.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Please repeat after me. I solemnly
swear…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: I solemnly swear…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: By the sacred memory…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: By the sacred memory…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Of Siegfried…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Of Siegfried…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Wagner…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Wagner…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Nietzche…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Nietzche…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Bismark…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Bismark…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Hindenburg…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Hindenburg…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: The Graf Spee…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: The Graf Spee…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: The Blue Max…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: The Blue Max…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: And last, but not least, Adolph… you know
who.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: And last, but not least,
Adolph… you know who.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Heil you know who!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Heil you know who!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Good. Good. Now ve sign the contract.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: No. No. Not in ink. We’ll desecrate the
oath. It must be done in blood.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Fingers, please.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Ve vill sign vit this sacred qvill taken
from the last chicken I served at Berchtesgarten.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: the contract with the</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Look, I’m just not wearing this arm band. I
don’t care how big the deal is.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Okay, take it off, take it off.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: The Blue Gypsy.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We are not going to The Blue Gypsy. I am
going to The Blue Gypsy.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I have a rendez-vous with a lady of some
means. You see dear Bloom, phase one is complete, the play is ours. We
are now entering phase two – the raising of the money. In the days to
come, you will see very little of me, for Bialystock is launching
himself into little- old-lady-land. Avanti!</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #3</strong>: Here’s to the success of your
new play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Our play, my love.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #3</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Bialy, did I wet
you?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Think nothing of it, my dear. A mere
trifle. A mere trifle. Did you bring your checkbook?</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #3</strong>: It’s right here in my purse and
I made it out just as you told me – to cash. That’s a funny name for a
play.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Think nothing of it.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #4</strong>: Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again.
Tell me again.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Edna, I swear on my life, you don’t look
a day over sixty-five.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Clear the road! Clear the road!</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #5</strong>: Go, Bialy, baby, go!</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #6</strong>: Go on with the concert! Go on
with the concert! It’s nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #6</strong>: You dirty man.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #7</strong>: Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo,
ooo, teehee hee.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Heh, heh, heh. Hah, hah, hah.</p>
<p><strong>little old lady #8</strong>: Well, Bialy, how’s it
coming?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s beautiful, Alma, beautiful. Oi.</p>
<p><strong>hold me, touch me</strong>: Dance! Dance, slave!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How’s this?</p>
<p><strong>hold me, touch me</strong>: Faster, faster, you dog. Excite
me, delight me. Hold me, touch me.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Money is honey, money is honey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mrs. Sarah Catheart. She owns 50% of the
profits.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe. She also owns 50%
of the profits.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 50% of
the profits.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100% of the
profits.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Leo, what if this play is a hit?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of
Bialystock and Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: OI. I’m depressed. Leo, do me a favor.
Open the safe. I want to see the money.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I’m going to buy a toy. I worked very,
very hard and I think I deserve a toy.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: A toy?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s a toy?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Yes. She’s an adult, educational toy
made in Sweden for children over fifty.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Stop looking at me like that. She’s not
an indulgence. She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our
new surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Ulla, I’d like you to meet my partner
and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Got dag pa dig.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How do you do. Have you gone mad? A
receptionist that can’t speak English. What will people say?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They’ll say, “Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh,
ooh.”</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What is she gonna do here?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I’ll show you. Ulla, go to work.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Ya, sur.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: See, it helps the day go by. Ulla, okay.
Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Go to desk. Answer telephone.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bialystock and Bloom. Bialystock and
Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Bialystock and Blum. Bialystock and Blum.
Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig. Bialystock and Blum.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Hey, Blum, have a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nothing. Nothing. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Min Bialystock.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nice girl.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy
on the spending. I mean these offices and everything.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Why? Take it when you can get it! Flaunt
it, baby, flaunt it!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But if something should… God forbid… go
wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back. It would
look better in court.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Stop talking like that, you white mouse!
Nothing’s going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken
steps to insure total disaster. At two o’clock we have an appointment
with none other than Roger De Bris.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh yes, the
director. Is he good… I mean bad?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Roger De Bris is the worst director that
ever lived.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Do you think he’ll take the job?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Only if we ask him.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Come on. We’d better hurry. We’re
late.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Call chauffeur. Get car.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Good. Good. We go Motel.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No. We go.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: You, Blum go Motel.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Get car. Get car.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Very nice girl.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Thank you, Rudolfo.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Now don’t let anything he does or says
upset you. He’s a little peculiar.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Yesssssss?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I am Max Bialystock. This is my
associate, Mr. Bloom. We have an appointment with Mr. De Bris.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Ah, yes, you’re expected. Please come
in.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: How do you do. I’m Carmen Giya, Mr. De Bris’
private secretary. Would you be so kind as to remove your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: White, white, white is the color of our
carpets.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Now, let’s see, you’re wearing grey. I would
suggest the crimson. They’re a little vivid, but your suit is so quiet.
Why don’t you… Oh, take anything. Please follow me.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: I’ll never get into this damned thing.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: We’re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I
presume. Ha, ha, ha, forgive the pun.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What pun?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up. He thinks he’s witty. It’s good
to see you again, Roger. Did you get a chance to read “Springtime For
Hitler?”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Remarkable. Remarkable. A stunning piece of
work.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max! He’s wearing a dress.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: I think it’s a very important play. I, for
one, never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany. I mean it’s
drenched with historical goodies like that.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Oh, dear, you’re staring at my dress. I
should explain. I’m going to the Choreographer’s Ball tonight. There’s a
prize for the best costume.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: We always win.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: I’m not so sure about tonight. I’m supposed
to be the Grand Duchess – I think I look more like Tugboat Annie. What
do you think?</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: No be cruel. Be brutal. Be brutal. Because
heaven knows they will. Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, it’s… uh… it’s nice and long… I mean,
it’s… uh… uh… where do you keep your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: It’s gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. You
couldn’t have picked a better color. It brings out your eyes. Let’s face
it, Roger, that dress is you.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Do you really think it brings out my
eyes?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: We can’t tell a thing without your wig. As
far as I’m concerned, you’re only half-dressed.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Ummmm. Well, if you’re so worried about the
wig, get it, o’ wicked witch of the west.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Quick, light his cigarette. He likes
you.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Didn’t I meet you on a summer cruise?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ve… I’ve… never been on a cruise.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Oh, quel dommage.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Oh, I see we’re getting acquainted.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: How would you like to go back to teasing
hair, big mouth?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Roger, do you mind if we talk a little
business?</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Please, please, that’s what we’re here for.
Be careful, that hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I think this would be a marvelous
opportunity for you, Roger. Up to now, you’ve always been associated
with musicals, and…</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.
Two-three-kick-turn! Turn- turn-kick-turn! It’s enough to make you throw
up! At last a chance to do straight drama! To deal with conflict, with
inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we
should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They’re
losing the war. It’s too depressing. We’ll have to put something in
there. Aaahghhh! I see it! A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm
Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together…
Two-three-kick-turn! Turn-turn- kick-turn!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: That’s genius. That’s genius. Roger, I
think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you’re the only
man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Wait a minute. This is a very big decision.
It might effect the course of my entire life. I’ll have to think about
it. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Get on the phone. Send out a casting call.
Call every agent in town. I want to see everybody. Everybody.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Roger, what about that one? The fat
Hitler on the right?</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: I don’t know. I rather fancy that one.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Not bad. Not bad. What do you think,
Franz?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. For some
strange reason, I’m deeply moved.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam. We must have
some order.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Will all the dancing Hitlers please wait in
the wings. We’re only taking the singing Hitlers.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Arthur Packard.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Hello, Arthur. Tell us something about
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>arthur packard</strong>: I was the lead tenor of the
Albuquerque Opera Company for two seasons. I just finished a road tour
of STUDENT PRINCE. And last season I was up for the lead in the Broadway
production of Circus Man.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>arthur packard</strong>: I didn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: What are you going to sing for us
Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>arthur packard</strong>: The soliloquy from CAROUSEL.</p>
<p><strong>arthur packard</strong>: My boy Bill will be strong and as
tall as a…</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Next please.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Jason Green.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Well, Jason, what have you been doing
lately?</p>
<p><strong>jason green</strong>: For the last sixteen years, I’ve been
touring with “Naughty Marietta.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Good. And what are you going to sing for
us, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>jason green</strong>: “Stout-hearted Men.”</p>
<p><strong>jason green</strong>: “Give me some men Who are stout-hearted
men Who will fight for the right they adore.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thaaank you.</p>
<p><strong>bald hitler</strong>: “Show me some men Who are stout-hearted
men And I’ll soon show you ten thousand more.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thaaank you.</p>
<p><strong>italian hitler</strong>: “Shoulder to shoulder and bolder and
bolder They grow as they march to the war.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thaaank you.</p>
<p><strong>delicate hitler</strong>: “There is nothing in this world can
halt or mar our plan.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thaank you.</p>
<p><strong>short-haired woman hitler</strong>: “When stout-hearted men
Will get together man to man.”</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Thaaank you.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Well, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I think that’s enough Hitlers for one day.
Maybe we’ll get lucky tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You think out of all those Hitlers you
could find just one…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: It was the same thing in Germany. We
looked for years before we found the right Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Is this where they’re auditioning
Boomerang?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, I’m afraid you’ve wandered into the
wrong theatre.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Man, freaked out again.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Wait! This is Boomerang. This is
Boomerang.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Let’s hear him. What have we got to
lose? What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Lorenzo Saint DuBois. But everybody calls me
LSD.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: What have you done, LSD?</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Six months, I’m out on probation, but it’s cool
now, baby.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: I mean in show business.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Oh, in show business. Well, let’s put it this
way, my next job will be my debut.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: What do you do best?</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Hey, man, I can’t do that here, that’s what
they put me away for.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Oh, sing. Sing!</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Hey, baby, that’s where they put me, Sing-Sing.
How’d you know that, you been up?</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Sing a song! Just sing a song!</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Here’s a little thing I think you’re going to
see on the charts any day. I wrote it last night in my sleep. It’s a
Hindu Zen Folk Rock Ballad.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: That’s our Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vaaaat???</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Franz, don’t you see, Hitler was a man
of his time. This is a man of his time.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: But he has long hair!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Don’t look at the outside, look at the
inside. It’s the inner Hitler we’re after. The young beautiful Hitler,
who danced his way to glory.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Could be an exciting piece of off- beat
casting. Of course, we’d have to do something about that coiffure.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: But he’s so crazy, he’s so sloppy, he’s
so… so… American!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Franz, trust me. I promise I won’t let
you down.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: All right, but remember, if you damage the
Fuhrer’s reputation, I kill you.</p>

<p><strong>man</strong>: Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>man’s friend</strong>: I thought I’d split my sides.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Take it easy, don’t panic. There are a
lot of plays on this street. They are not necessarily talking about
“Springtime For Hitler.”</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Honey, I never in a million years thought
I’d ever love a show called “Springtime For Hitler.”</p>

<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Fairweather friend!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Maybe it’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No way out. No way out.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Bloom, Bloom, maybe it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No way out. No way out. What? Who?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Why don’t we go over to the theatre and
see what’s really happening? After all, we’ve only heard from a small
portion of the audience. Let’s hear what the majority thinks.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The majority. The majority. Yes. Let’s hear
from the majority.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t want to go in.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Come, we have to.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We are falling back on all fronts. Our
soldiers are retreating.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: No good, baby, no good. You heard my orders.
Nobody retreats. Attack! Attack!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Who can we attack? They’re all too big.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Hey, man, let’s stomp Switzerland!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We can’t… we keep our money there!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Baby, again with that baby. There must be
no more babies.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Where’s Goebbels? Where’s my little Joe?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Send for Goebbels.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: He’s the only cat left that still grooves
me.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Heil, baby! I just finished the morning
propaganda broadcasts.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: What did you tell the people?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I told them we invaded England.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Hey, baby, that’s good! How’d we come out?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: We won.</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Groovy!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Bring down the curtain! Bring down the
curtain!</p>
<p><strong>lsd</strong>: Goebbels, you’re the only one…</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I am the author of this play. You are the
victims of a hoax. These are not my words. The Fuhrer never said baby.
The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was good.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Get that curtain up.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: NO! No! The curtain must not go up!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: We have been betrayed! I will return! I
will returnnnnn…</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: We make love?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: No! No! We don’t make love. Go to
work.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Congratulations. It’s the biggest hit
on Broadway.”</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: “Congratulations. Hitler will run
forever.”</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Congratulations! Have you seen the reviews?
Have you seen the lines at the box office? It’s a torrent, it’s an
avalanche, it’s the biggest hit on Broadway!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You lousy fruit. You’ve ruined me!</p>
<p><strong>de bris</strong>: Help! Help! He’s crazy! He’s going to kill
me. Call the police! Call the police! Help, help, murder, murder, rape,
rape!!!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: How could this happen? I was so careful.
I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I
go right? We forgot one important, Bloom. Adolf Hitler always drew a
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t try to stop me. I’ve made up my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing with those books?
Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m turning myself in. It’s the only way. I’m
going to cooperate with the authorities. They’ll reduce my sentence and
then there’s time off for good behavior. And maybe I’ll get a job in the
prison library. So long.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Leo, take it easy. Relax, you’re
overwrought. You don’t know what you’re doing. You’re acting out of
panic… GIMME THOSE BOOKS!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I never should have listened to you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: I never should have listened to you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Double. Double. Double.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Haaaaa! Haaaaa! Haaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I am betrayed!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: You have broken the Siegfried Oath. You
must die.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: This is no good. I’m not killing you.
Don’t you understand, you have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die.
Vill you cooperate!!!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock and bloom</strong>: Come in. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: I hear noise. You call?</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Ahhh. I see you. You like something?
Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Coffee. Yes. That’s a good idea. Why
don’t you ask the gentleman with the gun… The gentleman who is shooting
at us… and trying to kill us… what he will have.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: You like coffee?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes, please. Black. Two sugars.</p>
<p><strong>ulla</strong>: Three coffees. Two regular. One black… two
sugars.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: And now ve must resume hostilities. Are
you coming out from behind that desk or not?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Not.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
Clinging to life like baby butterflies. Vatch, vatch and remember. Franz
Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und
Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler. I’m coming boys!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Boy, vhen things go wrong!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I’m a failure. I’m a failure. I’m a
failure.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Five o’clock. Killed a whole day playing
hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I’m not crazy. I’m inept.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There, there.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vhere? Vhere?… oh…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You crazy lunatic! What are you shooting
at us for? Why don’t you use this where it will do us some good? Why
don’t you shoot the actors? Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Never mind. Listen. Every night people
are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: It’s that LSD und his verdampter
babies!…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Here. Buy bullets. Kill. Kill them
all!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes. The actors. I must destroy the
actors.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stop! Stop! This is insanity.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Have you lost your mind? What are you talking
about? Kill the actors. You can’t kill the actors – they’re not animals,
they’re human beings!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: They are? Have you ever eaten with one?
Liebkind, go! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Liebkind, no!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What are you doing? We’re trapped. It’s
either the show or us. There’s no way out. What can we do, blow up the
theatre?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Fuse cap.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Fuse.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Gut. Now for the master connection.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Gut. Now vhere’s the other fuse?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Pick it up and bring it here, please.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Where are you going vit the light?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I need it. How’m I gonna find the fuse?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Oh, ve come vit you. All for one and all
in the light.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach
them to the terminals of the conductor and ve’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You mean out of business. Heh, heh.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Max, I…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, I… Well, it’s just that… I’m sorry I
called you fat, fat, fat.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Ahhhhhh. Leo, Leo, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Plus to minus. Negative to positive. Male
to…</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Come on. Let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Qviet. Qviet This is very important.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vait a minute. Vait a minute. Male to
male? Male to female? Female to male? Female to female? Vait a minute.
In people, male to female. But electricity is strange. It’s male to
male.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Sehr gut. Slow fuse, please.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Now ve take the slow fuse. Tie one end to
the master connection and the other ve attach to the detonator.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Come, ve go to the detonator.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vait a minute. Are you sure this is slow
fuse? It feels like qvick fuse. Shine your light on it.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. The markings
are so similar. Qvick fuse or slow fuse?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I must find out. It is critical.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Let’s face it. That was dumb.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Boys, vhere is you?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Dot vas the qvick one.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: We assumed that.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. It
is much wider. It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns
slower.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You mean you had the slow fuse in your
pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Yes. Amazing isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: You stupid kraut!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is
cabbage! Do ve call you hot dogs? Ve call you Yanks not franks!</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: All right. Finish the job. Let’s get
outta here.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Und now for the final connection.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Wait. I’ll check to see if the coast is
clear.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: The coast is clear!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Good. Get down.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Goodbye, my foolish fancy. Goodbye, my
misbegotten child. Goodbye, my tortured testament of twisted truths.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Do it! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: I can’t. I can’t do it. It’s a demon. It’s
a gargoyle, it’s a monster… but it’s still my child.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Here is gut… of course, of course. In
electricity, it’s always male to female. But with people, it’s not
always so. Come ve must go back.</p>
<p><strong>bialystock</strong>: Do you need us?</p>
<p><strong>liebkind</strong>: Of course I need you. It’s dark in
there.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Okay, okay. Let’s not waste time.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: “Honeymoon, keep a shinin’ in June,”</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: “your silvery beams, Will light love’s

the State Penitentiary.</p>
