<p><strong>shooting script</strong>: Revised Third Draft March 30, 1983
Becherman/Canton-Richter</p>
<p><strong>freedom of information act</strong>: Classified File #2TC1695
Dept. of Defense 3-1-50 thru 8-31-53 Re: Project Sawtooth</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The advent of the Soviet nuclear
capability ushers in a dangerous phase of the Cold War as the decade of
the 1950s looms. Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to
develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects
maverick Professor Toichi Hikita’s work in electromagnetic particle
acceleration…despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the
project.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese
quantum theorist, declares himself anxious to work for the Allies.
Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and
tags the tiny child “Buckaroo.” A tribute to his adopted homeland.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And thus given a second chance after his
secret pre-war laboratory disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new
life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack
scientists willing to gamble he’s right in his bold assertion that man
can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy,
affable limey, co-developer with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the
world’s most advanced theoretical gravity catapult…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in
Negative Mass Propulsion …wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.</p>
<p><strong>today</strong>: THIRTY YEARS LATER</p>
<p><strong>voice of mission control</strong>: T Minus five hundred and
counting. Phaser positive. Latch compressor.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Power source output, zero-zero-niner.
Multi-stage axial compressor latched.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Fuel pressure, 1800 torrs.
Oxygenation.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: You’re kidding. Where is he? Still
in the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Banzai hasn’t showed yet,
Mr. Secretary. Looks like he’s got cold feet.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Better see what’s keepin’ the boss,
Reno.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: ’Cause I’m busy. And get your
clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.</p>
<p><strong>the eyes of doctor buckaroo banzai, the rest of his face
hidden by a</strong>: SURGICAL MASK…such concentration.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Rawhide, it’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: I’ll ask him. Buckaroo, I need an estimate.
They’re getting antsy over at Mission Control.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Another ten minutes down here,
Rawhide.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: The chief needs ten more minutes. I got the
chopper waiting. Don’t start without us.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorwoman</strong>: So where’s Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Whadda you need Buckaroo for?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Unscheduled surgery. He’ll be
waltzing along momentarily. What’re you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorwoman</strong>: Flying to Cambodia.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: That’s why I wear a fifty dollar hat.
Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorwoman</strong>: Bet you say that to all the girls,
Perfect Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Bet I do.</p>
<p><strong>star surgeon</strong>: Jesus Christ…how does the man find
enough hours in the day?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: We help.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Dr. Banzai’s using a laser to fuse
artificial nerve fiber to the original, bypassing massive stroke damage.
A subcutaneous microphone’s gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal
instructions to his own brain.</p>
<p><strong>star surgeon</strong>: What, like “raise my left arm”?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Or “throw the harpoon,” depending on
cultural differences. People are gonna come from all over. This guy’s an
Eskimo.</p>
<p><strong>jewish physician</strong>: Okay…right…okay, I see…next time
I’ll be able to…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: There may not be a next time.</p>
<p><strong>jewish physician</strong>: Look…I’m sorry…calling for help in
the middle of an operation…but I just lost my nerve…I
panicked…again.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You’ve got the God-given tools to
be a success in any field of endeavor, Dr. Zwibel. Ever thought about
joining me full-time?</p>
<p><strong>jewish physician</strong>: Are you serious? Have you have an
opening?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Can you sing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. zwibel</strong>: A little. I can dance.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Inertial Control positive. T minus
seven zero and resume counting.</p>
<p><strong>mission control</strong>: All systems righteous. Professor
Hikita says we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: I’ve got a budget meeting on the
hill, John. What’s this thing supposed to do anyway?</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Three hundred miles an hour,
General.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Senator, you are so fulla shit.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: May not…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Final contact is made.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Point of no return…five, four, three,
two…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita’s voice</strong>: …one.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Too bad war ain’t Indianapolis.
It’s fast, I’ll give Banzai that.</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Perhaps an idea whose time has
come, General? Scoot over.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: It’ll never work. It’s too
simple.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorwoman</strong>: Now twenty seconds downrange…Perfect
Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the
ground?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: She’s just a damn road hugger,
Allison. Plus the man can drive.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Approaching thirty seconds downrange
Three zero. Course steady. Speed three one seven nautical-four
hundred…</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: He’s gonna do it! The man is
gonna do it!</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: So what? Big deal. Anybody can
drive fast in a straight line.</p>
<p><strong>leaving the paved surface for open terrain! begin
intercutting</strong>: BLOCKHOUSE AND JET CAR…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Buckaroo, do you read?</p>
<p><strong>mission control</strong>: Advise you abort. Over. Repeat:
advise abort.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: That’s a big “no can do”.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchorwoman</strong>: The Jet Car off the road! Radio
contact with Mission Control here severed…that firestorm apparently
interfering with communications…Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Either that or he’s popped his
cookies.</p>
<p><strong>mission control</strong>: Mach 1. Buckaroo! Do you read?
Commence braking procedure! Over!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: He’s heading for the goddamn
mountains!</p>
<p><strong>mission control</strong>: Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Professor Hikita, what’d he
say?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: He said, “This Bud’s for you,
Professor.” What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Looks like Banzai’s finally gonna
get more than he bargained for. And take the friends of the Earth with
him.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo’s pov…the face of the mountain rushing up into
frame!</strong>: COLLISION A PICO SECOND AWAY!</p>
<p><strong>close on monitor</strong>: THE JET CAR SIMPLY GONE, VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR…:65</p>
<p><strong>mission control</strong>: It’s off my scope!</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: What the devil? What is going
on?!</p>
<p><strong>helicopter newsman</strong>: He’s through it! He’s gone
through the mountain without a scratch! Oh, my God! Oh, my God in
Heaven!</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Banzai!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Chute negative. I’m gonna try and
lay her sideways.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: This his frequency? Nobody’s
home.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Gimme that! You tell me,
Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going- through-solid-matter-and
rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters- useless-over-night
bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Buckaroo! Did you seem them? Did
you?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: See ’em? They about had me and the
whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: The creatures? They attacked you? They
tried to possess you?</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Creatures? Buckaroo, Catburd here.
I got egg all over my face, but that’s okay. No room for egos here.
We’re all Americans and I wanna buy that thing of yours. What’s it gonna
run me?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: I wasn’t talking to you, Hikita
san.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: This’ll be the President of
me?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: She’s not for sale, right,
General?</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman on tv</strong>: Here she is, slowed down. Lookit
there…slam! Right into the side of that mountain! Perfect Tommy,
Rawhide, Reno, you guys’re the Hong Kong Cavaliers. Buckaroo’s most
trusted inner circle. So I gotta ask, did it surprise you fellas as much
as the rest of us when the BJV, the experimental jet vehicle went right
off the scope and apparently smack into a black void?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy on tv</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman on tv</strong>: Was Buckaroo acting different
this morning, I mean, in terms of other mornings?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide on tv</strong>: Well, we partied pretty late last
night.</p>
<p><strong>his left ahnd, acting independently of his right, erases the
equation</strong>: HE’S JUST WRITTEN…as his right hand reaches under his
pillow and picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET…a piece of metal
wrapped in copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo
now attaches directly to his thumbs…</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: The Overthruster! The
Overthruster!</p>
<p><strong>close on his hand now sticking the other end of his home-made
device</strong>: DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET…</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: The Overthruster!</p>
<p><strong>electrical current coursing through lizardo’s body…an
aura</strong>: SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS
SMILE…BURNING THE SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK
SEQUENCE:</p>
<p><strong>directly at a losid brick wall, throbbing electromagnets and
banks of</strong>: GLOWING OSCILLATORS…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo…almost…</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: More! More!</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Not so fast…</p>
<p><strong>periscope pov</strong>: HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN
AURA OF ELECTRICITY:TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM…ONE
CREATURE IN PARTICULAR ENVELOPING LIZARDO!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Cheer up, Lizardo, it’s Friday. I come for
your TV. You been using too damn much juice…ten thousand kilowatts again
this month. Beats me how one old homicidal loony could use that much
power.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: I want my TV…don’t take my TV…I want
it. I want the Overthruster. I want it.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Five…four…three…two…one.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’m starving…somebody, help.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Got a half a tuna sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Same one you had yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Smells fermented. Check in with the
Institute, Reno, see if everything’s kosher.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Buckaroo, I’ve done an advanced
spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive
shaft.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: And there’s a two-hundred-dollar deductible we
have to eat on that crack in her windshield.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Figures. Anybody seen my scope?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Coming right up, Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Anybody we know?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Who put this dirty picture in
Buckaroo’s viewer?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: I ran it through the centrifuge, but I
came up blank. It’s definitely dead now, although it still conducts
electricity even better than copper does.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Super performance organic
material.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way. However…
…notice…although certain components resist identification, it
corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Too closely. Gotta be more than
sheer coincidence. Rawhide, you’re keen on bugs. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Everything’s copacetic at the Institute,
Buckaroo. Sam’s with the Jet Car and she’s under lock and key. He’s
retiming her valves.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Buckaroo, you got a minute–?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Not really. This is pretty
important.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: She wants a picture.</p>
<p><strong>artie duncan</strong>: I don’t care who you are…when you play
my joint, you’re just another band. I want some music outta you
characters.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: You want it, Artie? You got it.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Everybody ready? How do we look? Do
we look okay?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: I look great. Let’s rock ‘n’
roll.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: No question about it. Something very akin
to arachnoid tissue. If I hadda guess? A mutated species.</p>
<p><strong>artie duncan’s voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, Artie’s
Artery is proud to present, for one night only…the one, the only, the
amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong Cavaliers!</p>
<p><strong>lights up! and a wave of good old fashioned rock ‘n’ roll
crashes out</strong>: ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining
the Hong Kong Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won’t sit
still!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I heard somebody crying. I said is
someone out there crying in the darkness?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Here…here at the back. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Raise your hand…where?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: This is so embarrassing…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Somebody get her a mike? Can we
manage that? And a spotlight. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Penny. I’d rather not reveal my last
name or my age.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Did you say…“Peggy”?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There
I’ve said it, but it won’t mean anything to you. I’m a nobody.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Nobody’s a nobody. Why’re you
crying? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Did I say anything was wrong? I just
sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I’m down to my last nickel in
this lousy town, I can’t get my luggage outta hock ’cause I met this
jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record. He
offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: He offered you money?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Do I look like that kinda girl? I lost
my room this morning. I don’t know where I’m gonna sleep tonight, but I
keep going. What the hell else can I do? I’ve still got my figure, and
like this bozo said, as long as there’s a sidewalk, I’ll always have a
job.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Remember it’s always darkest just
before the dawn. Believe me, I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: This song’s for Peggy. And all you
others out there a little down on your luck.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: My name’s, Penny! But who cares?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Let me go, let me go, you creeps…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Everybody okay up here?</p>
<p><strong>artie duncan’s voice</strong>: Arrest the girl! Let’s get
this thing on the road, huh?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where do you think you’re going, doc? The
moon?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: Operator! I wanna place a
person-to-person call to John Bigboote, Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems.
Grover’s Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it’s John Whorfin calling. That’s
W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H- N!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: Of course it’s me, John Bigboote, you
fool! Prepare for my return! The time has come. Haven’t you heard? Don’t
you watch TV? Banzai and Hikita have done it! I’ll meet you at the
factory. Get that overthruster! And the little Jap! Alive! Banzai’s too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Pick those up, Reno.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: I didn’t drop ’em.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: It’s a spittin’ image.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Doesn’t look anything like her to me.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Pictures don’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Hell they don’t. I met my first wife that
way.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: It’s Peggy to these eyes. Same nose,
same hair. Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn’t be ready to
go make a fool of himself, right?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo.
Thought you’d wanna be notified. That old pal of the professor’s,
Dr. Emilio Lizardo? The one you did the brain scan on–? He killed a
guard last night, broke outta the Trenton Home for the Criminally
Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled it a block away.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Vanished. Thin air.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Doctor Lizardo. Wasn’t he on TV
once?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: You’re thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy’s an
eccentric genius.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Dr. Lizardo’s a raving lunatic, Perfect
Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that
once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Have you warned Professor
Hikita?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: First thing I did.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Why? What’s going on? Anything I
oughta know? C’mon, Rawhide, spill it.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were
actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension. Almost fifty years
ago. Before Buckaroo’s parents even knew each other. But there was
trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in,
half out…when they hauled him back ,he wasn’t the same guy. His hair was
orange…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: And his soul black as the Ace of
Spades.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: He went on a senseless crime spree, killed
a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane. The professor
told us they threw away the key.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Hey, any lock can be picked. So
what’s he up to?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’m sure we’ll find out soon
enough.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: And another thing. Somebody took five bucks
outta petty cash without signing.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Wasn’t me. I’d take a hundred,
right?</p>
<p><strong>radar sheild one</strong>: Lookit this, Buckaroo. Grossly
abnormal high-altitude electrostatic disturbance over Connecticut.
Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Doubt it. Check NORAD command.
Could be a volcanic ash cloud. Work her up statistically, check it for
the next twenty-four hours, then shovel the data over to Reno.</p>
<p><strong>dr. zwibel</strong>: Howdy, Buckaroo. Got your message about
rendezvousing here. Barely had time to pack my saddlebags.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Sid, welcome aboard. Fellas, meet a
medical colleague, Sid Zwibel. He’ll be riding with us from now on, so
get acquainted while I snoop around.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: The name’s Reno. This here’s Perfect
Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Where do you hail from, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. zwibel</strong>: New Jersey!</p>
<p><strong>reno nevada</strong>: Where’s your spurs at?</p>
<p><strong>dr. zwibel</strong>: You making fun of me?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Reno, how’s about you take New
Jersey’s gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of
the hands.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Cause Buckaroo needs me here.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Follow me, pard’ner.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What’re you doing here? Why’re you
looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I guess ’cause you remind me of
someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Go away. Let me rot?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Who were you really trying to kill
last night?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: You. Like the papers all say.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Pretty terrible shot.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Was she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: The girl I remind you of.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: She was the Queen of the
Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: It’s kinda hard this way.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’d turn around, but I’m afraid
you’d strangle me.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: The Netherlands. Whew, that’s a long
way from Wyoming.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Wyoming? Not Cody, by any
chance?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: No. Laramie. Except I was born in
Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Having a little trouble with that
knot, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Which? The one in my throat.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Did you have family there–? A
sister? In Cody?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: I don’t know. I always felt like I
did, like there was another me…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Another ‘you’?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Somewhere. See I was taken away by the
Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Adopted. I should have know. Of
course. If it was a snake, it’d bit me!</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What? I don’t understand you. I don’t
understand anything anymore.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Who does? It’s a crazy mixed-up
world. Just do the best you can with what you have…</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Running a little late, Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Let her out. In my custody.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Let her out? She’s a killer.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: No she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo
escaped…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’m assigning a couple Blue Shields
to protect you around the clock, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Thank you for coming. Before I
answer any questions, I think Buckaroo owes us all a few explanations
for yesterday’s antics.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Mr. Secretary…Senator Cunningham,
ladies and gentlemen…thirty years ago, nearly to this day, my mother and
father and Sir Alan Motley, all former colleagues of Professor Toichi
Hikita at the Texas School of Mines, gave their lives for what was
considered at the time an insane notion: the possibility of contacting
alien life… not on another planet, but on a simultaneous plane of
existence within solid matter…life which, before the war, Professor
Hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity
catapult with Doctor Emilio Lizardo.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: One and the same.</p>
<p><strong>someone else’s nearsighted pov, peering at the back of
professor</strong>: HIKITA’S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND
THE DAIS…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I don’t wanna go get too technical
here, ladies and gentlemen, but I’m talking twister physics. Quantum
Mechanics. Now you see, now you don’t. This table I’m sitting behind? It
appears to be solid matter, right?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: But in point of fact, the solid
parts of this table… the protons, quarks, your neutrons and
electrons…they comprise only about one quadrillionth of its total
volume.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Which is not a helluva lot to
sink your teeth into.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Exactly. So the professor here, way
back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a
person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables.
And mountains.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: We at the Banzai Institute have at
last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens
solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Which we all know are the forces
that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Hey, better there than here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>radar shield one</strong>: The President’s calling you,
Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: The president of what?</p>
<p><strong>radar shield one</strong>: The President of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Is he still delirious?</p>
<p><strong>radar shield one</strong>: Can’t tell. It’s real fuzzy. I
patched him through to a pay phone down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number
7541, disappeared on a clear day in the North Atlantic. Long thought to
have been torpedoed, these pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the
Eighth Dimension.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Now wait a minute here…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Next transparency, please.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Buckaroo, don’t forget your
thruster.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You keep an eye on it.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai’s voice</strong>: Mr. President–? You
there?</p>
<p><strong>radar shield one</strong>: Seemed like a bad connection even
back on the bus. But they used the code.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Mr. President–? Some kind of
interference…I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Maybe it’s just a prankster. Some computer
whiz kid.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha
Clearance.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Go back to the bus and reroute the
call.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: And try the President’s private number at
the hospital. Make sure this is on the level. We’re busy people
here.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Pencil! Quick! Pen! Anything!</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Let me ask you to imagine the
Oscillation Overthruster as a sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a
steady stream of protons at a target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet
Car as a giant super- conducting magnet.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Sure, sure, but what about the
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Dimensions?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: I don’t guess they matter. It’s like
cheesecloth, I think. Minkowiski space…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: There! Those two! Don’t panic…</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Whadda you mean, Buckaroo? Where? What?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo’s pov…something extraordinary…across the room, two
ghastly</strong>: ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES,
HOLDING COFFEE CUPS…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Evil…pure and simple, from the
eighth dimension! Grab ’em!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Arachtoids! Stop ’em!</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Arachtoids?</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Okay, wise guys!</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Let those gun belts hit the floor!
And nobody follows, or the prof is history!</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Is this the kind of society you want?
A society of weak-kneed jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to
ruthless hoodlums who pick us off like flies?</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Or a society where we stand
strong, take charge of our own destiny, with the cry “So far and no
farther will we be pushed!”</p>
<p><strong>exhibitor</strong>: Hey, you can’t ride that!</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Any sign of Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: No! Ditto the professor-</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>…a dark, unnervingly prehistoric creature flying directly at
us,</strong>: GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE
OF ITS EXISTENCE…</p>
<p><strong>duck hunters</strong>: My God! What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>duck hunters</strong>: Jesus Christ–! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>1st hunter</strong>: It’s the latest issue!</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: What? A black ship? Where? A black
thermopod’s been shot down ten miles back.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: A black thermopod here? On Earth?!
Why, John Gomez? Why?</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: John Whorfin…maybe they know he’s
escaped!</p>
<p><strong>john o’conner</strong>: How? How could they possibly know?
They’re more than three trillion six hundred sixty million miles
away.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: They know everything! I told Whorfin
to sit tight. This could be the end of us all! We gotta get Banzai’s
Overthruster and get off this rock!</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Where was it, John O’Connor? How far
back?</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: I have a radio fix…</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: Death to the enemy!</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Death to the enemy–! Kill or die!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Rawhide. Come in. Over.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Over, Buckaroo. What’s up? Where in Hades
are you? I’m getting a lotta static.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: That’s me. I’ve been ionized, but
I’m okay. I’m, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute
intervals.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the
Professor!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: The deuce you say. That crate!</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: What crate?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I think I’m on to something. You
and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an
outfit called Yoyodyne.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems? You think
they’re mixed up in this?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: How long you been riding with
Buckaroo, Reno?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta
scrapes together.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What’d you do before? Can I ask?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Government work. Had my own think tank. Got
tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you
if you stick around.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Where’s Buckaroo? Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Course he’s alive. He’s Buckaroo Banzai.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: All right. Let’s go! We got our work cut
out for us tonight!</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: You, too, Miss Penny.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: No thanks, I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Hand me that tarp. Let’s cover
this guy…</p>
<p><strong>2nd hunter</strong>: What guy? He’s got paws.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: John Bigboot�, Officer. Executive
Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: One of our birds.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: That fella over there-that one of
yours, too, is it?</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: The droid, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Button up in there, Professor, if you
know what’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Nice night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Looks like nothing I ever seen. I
seen droids in space movies, but they’re nothing like this-</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: It’s a three-man thermopod…</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Thermopod? What’s a…</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Very T.S. Top Secret, right John
Gomez?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Yeah, well, I was gonna call
Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look. Right up his alley, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: You called Buckaroo Banzai?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Not yet. I said I was gonna.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Go on! Keep it moving!</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: We got a truck on the way to mop things
up for you. Else this place could become a zoo, not to mention a haven
for gawkers.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: We’ll just go ahead and start
breaking it down.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Don’t touch it! I got my own help
on the way! That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: There’s a crowbar in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Buckaroo! What the Sam Hill!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Careful…don’t make noise and don’t
touch me. I’m hotter than flapjacks.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’m a giant semi-conductor, and
there’s alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I
think. Look…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: You can see them?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Ever since that phony phone call
from the President. Look at this. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: It’s your hand, Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: It’s an antidote. A formula.
Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the
ability to penetrate their disguises.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Antidote to what? Whose disguises?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Planet 10?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: There’s a Harley behind those
bushes. Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula. We
don’t have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Buckaroo, the formula–</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Hurry! Please.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: If you’re gonna stay, you’re
gonna be under arrest. It’s your choice.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Twelve minutes since the last signal.
Long time.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Too long. We better get somebody over
there. Put up the grid, last known location–</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Hop on the Marconi, see if we got any Blue
Shields within a ten-minute radius.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Open it!</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy’s voice</strong>: Repeat: Intrastate Outward
Band 5…Coded…calling all Blue Shield Irregulars in the Clam State.
Bucakroo in trouble…will repeat coordinates…</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: This is Scooter Lindley, Future
Knight of the Blue Shield 411/2. Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Dad! Dad! Buckaroo’s in
trouble!</p>
<p><strong>casper lindley</strong>: Say what?!</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always
breaking down.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Perfect Tommy’s just threatened by smart
women. Can you play that thing?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Better than him.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Whadda you think you’re doing?
Hey!</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: I said back off! I mean it. Now
get in your car and get the hell outta here!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Peggy–!? Oh, wow…no…</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: She’s not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Not Peggy–! Of course not. How could
she be, huh? Whew.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Any word from Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: No…I thought he was with you guys…</p>
<p><strong>brainy kid</strong>: Hi, fellas…gonna lay down some
background vocals tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Wish life was so simple, Billy. Remember
that outfit the Justice Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne
Propulsion Systems?</p>
<p><strong>brainy kid</strong>: The big space and weapons high tech
consortium way behind on their delivery of the controversial new
Truncheon Bomber?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: You got her. Buckaroo’s orders:
access their data bank. Attack their systems. Up to it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m a little short-handed tonight. My phone
phreaks went into town for the big ice cream social…</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: So we’ll help. Let’s get crackin’!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: Destroy yourself, John
Gant. Set detonator.</p>
<p><strong>john gant</strong>: Detonator set. My most profuse apologies
to my homeland and loved ones. John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head,
but perhaps John Parker will get through!</p>
<p><strong>second-in-command</strong>: But what if John Parker too is
dead? Then we must send another thermopod at once to contact Buckaroo
Banzai!</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: There’s no time. We have
our order from John Emdall.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: That’s it, gentlemen, you’re all
under…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Easy, friend-</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Buckaroo Banzai–!</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: It’s Buckaroo Banzai! Get him! He let
the professor outta the box!</p>
<p><strong>casper lindley</strong>: Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.
Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal. And my son,
Scooter.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Nothing to apologize for, Casper.
You’ve gone beyond the call of duty tonight. Mind if I get on the horn
and radio the Cavaliers–? They’ll be worried.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Not the famous Scooter….?</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Wow. You know it.</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: The prof just rolled in. Says he’s
on his way to the lab and “Do not disturb.”</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Try a new cipher. Try G.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: G cipher. There! More like it!</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Nice work, kid.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Looks like we’ve accessed their Read Only
Memory…a personnel file. Could be highly revealing.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: The professor just pulled in, jabbering
something about space monsters, locked himself in his lab.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: “Space monsters”…my ass.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: I’m sure the boys like you. They just
don’t wanna get attached…and then see what happened to Buckaroo’s last
sweetheart happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: You know any judo?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Any what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What’s up those stairs?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Bunkhouse. Off limits. You’ll be
bedding down in here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: This is queer…look…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: All these people applied for drivers’
licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: New Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Forty-six Yoyodyne employees. Grover’s Mill,
New Jersey, 11/1/38.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Grover’s Mills, Grovers’ Mills…1938. Why’s
that so darn familiar?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Looks like none of these guys ever lived
anywhere else. No places of birth. And all of them with the same first
name: John.</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: November 1, thirty days have September,
April, June, and November…when short February’s done, all the rest have
thirty-one. October 31st! Halloween! Don’t you get it? Orson Welles!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You mean the guy from the old wine
commercials?</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Halloween. 1938…“War of the Worlds”…that
fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real
live Martians were landing in Grover’s Mill, New Jersey! But then it all
just turned out to be a hoax.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Then that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: What’s it?</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Right! Hoax my eye!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: You mean–? No!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes! Martians! Right across the river in
Grover’s Mills!</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: Hi, buddy, what can I do for
ya?</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: Buckaroo Banzai?</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: You a messenger? What’ve you got
here?</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.
My name is John Parker. Identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: Knight Commander, Pinky
Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people “need see” Buckaroo in
person.</p>
<p><strong>sudden voice</strong>: That’s as far as you go, pal.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay, who’s the funny guy?</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Not here! No Overthruster!</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: John Whorfin will kill us!</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: You look! It’s not here!</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: Professor Hikita!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Buckaroo!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Is the professor here? Where’s
Penny?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Both of ‘em safe and sound. What’s
going on? Everybody’s freakin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: They’re arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet
10!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: What? How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: It’s all on the record. Come on-</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you
postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Yeah, but most of ’em blasted in
through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover’s Mills, New Jersey…</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: …where there was some kinda giant crash
landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it
up! And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there
for…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Orson Wells? What about Doctor
Lizardo?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Lizardo caused it all. Because he was
already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid
Overthruster.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Faulty design. It sucked.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: …but he wasn’t the real Doctor Lizardo…just
this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc’s body the year before in
the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita’s lab exploded…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Stole his body? When Doctor
Lizardo’s hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What
else?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: It wouldn’t tell us the whole story
until you got here. It wasn’t to talk to the head honcho.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: It? Who does?</p>
<p><strong>still possesses enough static electricity in his hand to draw
a sheet</strong>: OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Stand back, man…</p>
<p><strong>hologram</strong>: Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai. I am
John Emdall from Planet 10. A common grave danger confronts both our
worlds.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: Oh, wow…</p>
<p><strong>john emdall</strong>: After a bloody reign of terror, the
hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed “Lord” Whorfin,
a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by
freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred
of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth
Dimension. Death was deemed too good for their ilk.</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see
her?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: She’s not in her room…I looked.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Will everybody please shut up so I
can hear this thing?</p>
<p><strong>john emdall</strong>: Were it not for the experiments of your
father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John
Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of
existence.</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: “John Parker” I think he called
himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil. With a
weird album…how the hell was I supposed to know he came from outer
space?</p>
<p><strong>john emdall</strong>: And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have
unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation
Overthruster! For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about
to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension…and
on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to
disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam
weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet
Socialist Republics.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: An action the Kremlin will most
certainly misinterpret as an American first strike!</p>
<p><strong>john emdall</strong>: Exactly, Perfect Tommy. The Soviets
will retaliate. Your President Widmark will launch a massive
counterforce strike…and within twenty minutes the danger to Planet 10
will be removed…</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: God, if it’s not one thing it’s another.</p>
<p><strong>john emdall</strong>: But…because we’re good guys, we’re
giving you a chance to save your planet. Stop John Whorfin before
sunrise! If you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves.
End of discussion.</p>
<p><strong>casper lindley</strong>: She gotta be kiddin’, right?
Vaporize the whole damn planet–?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You wanna take the chance,
Casper?</p>
<p><strong>casper lindley</strong>: Not me. No way.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Rawhide, go find out how Professor
Hikita’s coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and
Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Wow, you know it!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Where’re you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: To get my guns.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: His guns? Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Open up or I’ll shoot it off.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: I’ll shoot yours off if I had a gun,
you double-dealing Casanova! I thought you liked me for myself. But why
should you, huh? A jerk like me.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Penny, look-</p>
<p><strong>penny’s voice</strong>: You look. Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: That’s kinda complicated to get
into right now because the world’s maybe coming to an end and I can’t
stand here and talk to a closet door.</p>
<p><strong>penny’s voice</strong>: Yeah, whose world is coming to an
end? You only wanted me because I remind you of her.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Penny, I was going to get into
that, but I haven’t had time…with arachtoids and all…but briefly she was
your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that’s about all I can
say. Right now. Penny?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Married–? So that’s it! Buckaroo
Banzai, a married man. Where is she? With the kids some place?</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: She must’ve been a bigger fool than me
if she ran out on a guy like you…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: She was killed, Penny.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Don’t go to pieces. I haven’t got
time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Looks like you’re the one might go to
pieces.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Where’s my damn ammo? Nothing is
ever where it’s supposed to be around here!</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: How did she die? I wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I’m
stronger than you think.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on
our wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Hanoi Shan–? The guy in your comic
books. Boss of the World Crime League? Supreme Commander of the Legion
of Death? The Pivot of Mystery himself? You’re putting me on. He’s a
cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I wish he was. He’s real
enough.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: God, she’s so young and beautiful. I
don’t remember her at all. Which I guess is good, under the
circumstances. I bet you’ll never forget her though.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: I gotta be honest with myself and not
repress these feelings-I’ve got mixed emotions-I don’t know if I can
handle this. Oh, boy…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I gotta go. We’re on borrowed
time.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Go where? Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Please, Penny. You just gotta trust
me now. Okay? And don’t panic. Because it’s gonna be all right.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: What? If we just believe in Buckaroo
Banzai?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Yeah…and maybe more important, if
you believe in yourself.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Believe in Penny Priddy?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: You’ve got your six guns strapped on.
You’re ridding off on another adventure? Oh, my God, it’s all real…it
really is real. I should go with you. Please…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: That’s just what you would say. This
is so unreal. I’m dreaming…</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Buckaroo–! Sorry–</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: What is it, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Sam’s dead! Someone broke into the
Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Stay here, I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Sure. I won’t hold my breath.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Whadda you want?</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Dead. Damnit!</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Where’s the professor?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Where’s Rawhide?</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Who’d do a thing like this?</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Arachtoids.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Spread out. They can’t be far.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Look out, Buckaroo!</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor’s under
the floor too…with the Overthruster…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Professor–!?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita’s voice</strong>: Here, Buckaroo!</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Buckaroo! Rawhide! Reno? Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Take it, young lady! Grab it!</p>
<p><strong>…extends his arm up and across the room…his human hand
tightening</strong>: AROUND HER MOUTH…</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita’s voice</strong>: Go back, Buckaroo!</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: You’re a welcome sight…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Just ‘grazed’ you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Apache?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Arachtoid.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: So I was right. That’s nice to know…</p>
<p><strong>pinky carruthers</strong>: We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker
dug a hole and tried to…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Any antidote for these things?</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: No, none.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: That mean you’re on our side?</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: We gotta stop ’em, Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: We will, old fried, we will.</p>
<p><strong>rawhide</strong>: Sure do pack a mean wallop…let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: There’s another one we owe ’em.</p>
<p><strong>casper lindley</strong>: They’re stealing my chopper!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: And they got Penny! Look!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Don’t shoot!</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: She has the Overthruster!</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: Then your planet is doomed.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: No! We’ll get it back.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: It’s not Buckaroo Banzai per
se, Mr. President. It’s his men…some of then foreigners…Asiatics, their
names changed, their true backgrounds shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when
you come right up against it, what do we really know about any of
’em?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: These’ll make you a tenny bit drowsy,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: That’s okay, Bonnie, I won’t be
operating any heavy machinery today.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: We’ve never had a weapon like
the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President. Light-weight, highly mobile,
stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple grenade launchers, hell, we
could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars for the price of ten tanks,
send ’em swarming all over Ivan like bumble bees, sir, right clear
through their precious little Iron Curtain like it was Swiss cheese!
They gotta be just scared shitless!</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: As are all sane men today.</p>
<p><strong>secreatry of defense</strong>: Hey, and me too. That’s why
I’m saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to submit his boys to at least a
routine government security check, that Jet Car should be in the hands
of Defense, and if they won’t sell us the technology, then
Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take it! In the national
interest.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: World Watch One. Direct incoming
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: Hello, Mr. President. How’s
my favorite patient? Any tenderness?</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: That which does not kill us makes
us stronger, Buckaroo. What’s it like out there in the real world?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: Not too terrific, sir. I
apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its
ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth’s caught in a
crossfire.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: You’re gonna have to repeat that,
I think, Buckaroo.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: To cut right to the bottom line on
this, sir, we have reason to believe that there are moving freely among
us, vicious red aliens disguised as the owners and operators of Yoyodyne
Propulsion Systems.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense on tv</strong>: Yoyodyne Propulsion? The
people working on our Truncheon bomber? Under control of alien
nationals? Reds? Commies, you say?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no.
Real aliens. Giant red arachtoids camouflaged as human beings…and what
they’re really building, forget your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is
this enormous rocketship to escape back through the Eighth Dimension and
then on to Planet 10.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense on tv</strong>: Now wait one second…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: The gentleman standing here with me
is called John Parker, and he can corroborate everything I’ve said
because he’s from Planet 10 too.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Buckaroo…you and I, we go back a
long, long way together…but…</p>
<p><strong>john parker on tv</strong>: Time is short, Mr. President. To
prevent John Whorfin’s escape, my comrades are at this moment taking up
a geostationary position over New Jersey. This situation is
explosive!</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Explosive? What are you saying,
man? Some kind of race war in New Jersey–?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: No, sir. This ‘man’ as you call
him, is not a human being, Mr. President. He’s a black arachtoid.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: That’s some kind of spider,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>president widmark on tv</strong>: Buckaroo, my good
friend…I’d like to help you…but don’t you think I would’ve heard from my
SAC radar by now if…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: SAC wouldn’t know what to
look for, sir. Because these black arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside
a huge thundercloud.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Get me John Bigboote at
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc. Then… …the FBI. Let’s see if this
spade’s wanted. What the hell’s his name again? Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>john parker on tv</strong>: Parker. I have delivered a
hologram from my president, John Emdall, who has made it clear that
unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, she intends to fire an atomic
beam from your American airspace…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: …hit Smolensk and precipitate
a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: A thermonuclear holocaust,
sir. These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American
tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir,
if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: You’re quite serious about this,
aren’t you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: John…? John Bigboote? Right,
Bigboot�, sorry. Anyway, hey, guy, how’s everything over there at
Yoyodyne? How’s my big bomber coming? Nothing out of the, you know,
ordinary? Spiders? I know you’re busy…lunch? Sounds good…when’s good for
you? Next Tuesday? I’m writing it down in my book. See you then…Uncle
Sam’s treat.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark on tv</strong>: Well. I don’t know what to
say, Buckaroo…aliens from Planet 10, nuclear extortion, spiders in
thunder clouds, a girl named “John”…</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: There’s your answer! Electromagnetic
bacterial crap!</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Programmable!</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: We inhale the bacteria. It swims to our
cerebral cortex and reprograms our consciousness. Diabolical. We only
see what they want us to see.</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Electric brainwashing.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense on tv</strong>: Just curious, Buckaroo,
but where’s the Jet Car at these days?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’ve got it, Mr. Secretary. But
unfortunately the Oscillation Overthruster is in Penny Priddy’s
possession and she’s been kidnapped and taken to Yoyodyne, further
exacerbating the situation. We’re on our way there right now.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Who the hell’s Penny Priddy?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Buckaroo, John Parker has the
arachtoid cloud on line 2!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai on tv</strong>: Excuse me a moment,
Mr. President. We’re talking to the cloud right now.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Good God…</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Well, if it wasn’t Buckaroo
Banzai, I’d say commit the man.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and
the Strategic Space Command. I want some hard data on that cloud. We got
any killer satellites over Jersey- -?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: They’re armed for bear, Buckaroo. Check out
those radiation levels.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: John Parker, tell them we’re doing
our best. Stall.</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a
virtue, Wing Commander, sir.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: It’s Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Whorfin? Does he know we’re
coming?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Well, well…Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you
don’t remember me? Ah, I’m flattered. We know the same people. In fact,
one of them is here with me now…your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: “Doctor”–?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: May I pass along my congratulations
for your great achievement. In the miserable annals of the Earth, you
will be duly enshrined! However… …Miss Priddy claims to be unable to
solve my problem. And provide the crucial missing circuit for my
Overthruster. Perhaps you can convince her to try.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: I’m not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget
me!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Penny–?! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: She knows nothing, Lizardo.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Then shall we say “A Penny for your
thoughts?” You can come in her place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone,
with your Overthruster! He’ll bring it. I know his type.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Take her to the pit! Use more honey.
Find out what she knows.</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Who are you? Hanoi Shan? The Scourge
of Burma! The Pivot of Mystery? Well, you’re not destroying me like you
did my sister!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: These antidote filters the
Professor’s whipped up will let you to see them like I have since
yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won’t be pretty, nothing
personal, John Parker. But just remember…if we fail tonight, there’s no
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: They will never surrender. They will
fight to the end.</p>
<p><strong>seeing now “the alien” john parker with a mixture of
disbelief and</strong>: HORROR…Casper and Scooter Lindley especially
unsettled…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’m working under the assumption
that Penny still has the Overthruster. That’ll be my job: get it back in
one piece. Here’s the main gate. I’ll pass through first, alone. The
rest of you divide into two strike groups-Apache Team…that’s you,
Reno…and Chaparral Team, Perfect Tommy. John Parker’ll ride with
Chaparral.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Top priority is the Overthruster.
Whorfin can’t escape without it. The built-in tracking device should
make it relatively simple to locate…maybe hard to get.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Buckaroo, come in…over. How does
this damn thing work? Can anybody figure this lighter out?</p>
<p><strong>national security man</strong>: No, sir. I think the
flint…</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: What’s happening with my call to
SAC?</p>
<p><strong>national security man</strong>: Still no confirmation either
from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance
satellite communication jammed.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Jammed–? By who? Whom by?</p>
<p><strong>national security man</strong>: Possible atmospheric
condition, sir…solar. It’s unusual, but no cause for alarm. Intelligence
reports the Soviets are having the same problem.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Should we be on Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: We go to Code Red, the Russians go
to Code Red…no sense jumping off half-cocked, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: I don’t know…Buckaroo Banzai’s
never been wrong before.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: The man went through solid matter,
for crying out loud. Who knows what it did to his brain…maybe scrambled
his molecules. All I’m saying is, let’s not panic here! I’m sure there’s
a rational explanation…</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: Russian radar is down,
sir. They’ve just gone to Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: We’ve got no choice then. Call my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: Code Red. “Butch says
we’re crimson.”</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Mr. President, none of us here are
lunatics or irrational men… …or persons. I’m a soldier and I’m a damn
good one, enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don’t mind
telling you, I’m sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am
scared. I’m barely holding my fudge right now.</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: Stop acting like a goddamn
schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself together.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: I’m glad someone has the balls to
face facts! Forget we’re the good guys and we’d never attack first. They
think we’re godless monsters just like them. Put yourself in their
samovars…sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over the
damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming into
the Great Hall of the People. Now, do you think they’re gonna listen to
reason? I’ll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think
they will?</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: Soviet radar is down,
sir, and so is ours. We’re both totally defenseless. More or less.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Hail Mary.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: So what’s our counter option,
General Catburd? Earn your salary.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: I guess we have to prick this boil
and take the heat, sir. Hit ’em primero…blast ’em off the face of the
Earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Larry, where’s my Football?</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: Out in the hall, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: What’re you waiting for, boy? Get
in here with that thing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. johnson</strong>: For the President! From Buckaroo
Banzai!</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: We’re waiting for the Jet Car. Billy’s
bringing it.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Asshole probably got lost.</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Or nailed for speeding.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Can I have everyone’s attention?
I’m not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I’m not much for speeches, but things
could get rough out there tonight. It’s a fight we didn’t ask for, but
it’s a fight we’re stuck with and we all saw what happened to Rawhide.
So if for any reason this is good-bye, I want you all to know
that…well…that…you crazy lugs…</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: What, Buckaroo? You trying to tell us
something?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Let’s just fry those
arachtoids.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Give me thirty minutes. Then come
in and mop up.</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: Well… that’s certainly food for
thought.</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: No answer at the Kremlin,
sir. Just dead silence.</p>
<p><strong>general catburd</strong>: Here you go, Mr. President…the
Sealed Authenticators. The Plan D Documents for your eyes
only…John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves a knockout little force
posture…</p>
<p><strong>senator cunningham</strong>: You know, on second thought,
maybe we should think this through a bit more so that future generations
of…</p>
<p><strong>president widmark</strong>: “Name of the enemy”? What, Planet
10? My hand’s shaking. How on earth can I even…have to stay awake,
alert…that’s my job. That’s what the people put me here for.</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: Where is Buckaroo
Banzai?</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid at scope</strong>: John Parker tells us he’s
approaching Yoyodyne, Wing Commander, sir.</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: Keep me posted.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Blacks are on this planet! Here in
New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We must move! Escape or die!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: You must work faster to finish the
Great Vehicle. So that we can enter the Eighth Dimension and free our
trapped comrades! So we can return to our homeland and seize power once
again!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: Where are we going? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>red arachtoids</strong>: To Planet 10!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>red arachtoids</strong>: Real soon!</p>
<p><strong>john gomez</strong>: Not here!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I thought you had it!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo’s voice</strong>: Take him to the Shock
Tower!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Solve them! The shock tower is a lie
detector. Any untruth triggers a brutal charge to your auditory
meatus…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You’re not getting a damn thing
outta me until Penny’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: Curse you, Banzai! Don’t you realize
what you’re saying? Your planet’s about to be destroyed, and you’re
wasting time like this…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: I’ve got nothing but time.</p>
<p><strong>the tower zapping buckaroo, a fierce electric shock tossing
him back</strong>: AND FORTH LIKE A RAG DOLL…</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Sealed with a curse as sharp as a
knife…doomed is your soul, and damned is your life!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: I want my missing circuit now!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Who the hell are those guys?
Where’s Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: You bloody–!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: She’ll live…for a while, and she
won’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Only you can save her from the fate
of your friend, Mr. Rawhide! Solve this equation. I must have the
crucial missing circuit.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: The missing circuit’s in your head,
Whorfin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lizardo</strong>: Whorfin? How do you know that’s my real
name?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: John Emdall told me.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Anybody got a report-anybody
got anything? Or are we still blacked out?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Light precipitation. Partly cloudy
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>secreatary of defense</strong>: This bus should be in the
hands of Defense.</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Could I have your autograph,
Mr. Parker?</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Say, “To my best friend
Scooter…”</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>scretary of defense</strong>: What the hell are we doing?! I
don’t believe this…what’re we waiting for? Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>prof. hikita</strong>: Ten minutes more. Buckaroo’s
orders.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Damn Buckaroo! I’m the eyes
and ears of the President of these United States of America! In loco
presidentis! Which means I’m in charge here!</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Not on this bus, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Who the hell do you think you
are?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Perfect Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Well let me tell you
something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don’t need this shit. I could be on Easy
Street with a cushy job in the private sector. But instead, I got me a
nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the- hell-behind-schedule top-secret
bomber being built down there by Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don’t
intend to set twiddling thumbs in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes
crashing around my airplane looking for his damn girlfriend, driving a
car that itself is probably worth more to this country than all the tea
in China! I’m talking National Security risk and we are going in there
like gentlemen and straighten this thing out before somebody gets hurt!
You got that?</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle…the secretary cracking a shot off at the
windshield!</strong>: 351</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Hit it, soldier boy! Move this
buggy! That’s a goddamn executive order!</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Go ahead, Louie, do like the man
says.</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Hey, so we get into action quicker
this way. We tell Buckaroo our watches were fast.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: That’s far enough, black
boy…</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: I’ll handle the negotiations
here… Slow her down.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: You fellas got a phone? Ring

<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Then I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: They sense us. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Stop him! Get him!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Kill the girl!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Bigboote!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: What the hell…that ain’t no
Truncheon bomber, my friend. I never approved that!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Bigboote!</p>

<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: It’s not over yet…I’ll bounce
back…always have. I’ll come through this thing smelling like a goddamn
rose-just watch me.</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: Leave her to me. You take care of
business.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Sound the call to board ship!</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: Without the crucial missing circuit?
We’ll never make it!</p>
<p><strong>john o’connor</strong>: They are only monkey boys! We can
still crush them here–!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: You heard my orders! Activate the
Special Horns!</p>
<p><strong>secretary of defense</strong>: Coming through! Clear it!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Massacre them! Without quarter!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Close the doors!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: What is this thing? A fighter?</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: Don’t look at me, Buckaroo Banzai. I
failed flight school.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Overthruster in place.</p>
<p><strong>john bigboot�</strong>: It won’t work! It won’t!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Shut up, John Bigboote, you

<p><strong>john bigtoote</strong>: We haven’t a chance. Your
Overthruster’s for shit! We’ll all just…</p>
<p><strong>john whorfin</strong>: One more word out of you,
Bigboote…</p>
<p><strong>john bigtoote</strong>: Bigboot�.</p>
<p><strong>whorfin’s voice</strong>: Full speed ahead! Battle
stations!</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: Banzai has failed! John
Whorfin is airborne!</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid officer</strong>: but not in the Eighth
Dimension. Shouldn’t we wait? Maybe John Parker-</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: I have my order from John
Emdall! 8000 miles. Mark. Activate particle beam. Lock on Smolensk.</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid chatter</strong>: Particle beam
activated…lock on Smolensk…one minute to rapid rupture…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Tell them to stop. They’re your
friends!</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: I lack the authority, Buckaroo
Banzai.</p>

’em something–!</p>

suction</strong>: DEVICES outside holding the thermopod in place.</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid officer</strong>: Sir, a thermopod has peeled
off from Whorfin’s ship!</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid commander</strong>: So what? Big deal. Stand
by to incinerate Smolensk.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Does this thing have guns, John
Parker?</p>
<p><strong>john parker</strong>: Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.</p>
<p><strong>angle through windshield…activating the overthruster beam
which</strong>: BLASTS OUT HARMLESSLY INTO THE MORNING SKY RIGHT IN
FRONT OF THEM.</p>
<p><strong>black arachtoid chatter</strong>: Twenty seconds to rapid
rupture. Two zero. Prepare the heat shields!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Take the throttle, John Parker!</p>
<p><strong>john whorfin</strong>: Banzai! I’ll see you in hell!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we
did it! Pull up!</p>

<p><strong>doctor lizardo</strong>: Toichi–? I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: All accounted for? Where’s
Penny?</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: New Jersey brought her back to the
bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Got a casualty list?</p>
<p><strong>reno</strong>: Just their side. What’re we gonna do with
these people? They’re illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty
years, you could throw the book at ’em…</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: And ask the American taxpayer to
foot the bill? No way. Send ’em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as
we find the Overthruster. It wasn’t in Penny’s purse…so if we have to
run this joint upside down and inside out…</p>
<p><strong>perfect tommy</strong>: Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Is this what you’re looking for,
Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Looks like one Junior Shield is in
line for a ride in The Jet Car.</p>
<p><strong>scooter lindley</strong>: Wow, you know it! I’ll have to ask
my dad.</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Well, go ahead, what’re you waiting
for?</p>
<p><strong>new jersey</strong>: I did all I could. I did my best…</p>
<p><strong>radar shield one</strong>: Buckaroo, Reno said check with you
- something about “pirates”? He mean the baseball team?</p>
<p><strong>radar shield two</strong>: Buckaroo, the President’s on line
on. Calling about is everything okay with the alien space cloud and
Planet Ten…or should he just go ahead and destroy Russia…?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Tell him yes on “1” and no on
“2”.</p>
<p><strong>radar shield two</strong>: Which was “yes”? Destroy Russia?
Or “2”…?</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Penny!</p>
<p><strong>buckaroo banzai</strong>: Open your eyes! Look at me!
Penny!</p>
<p><strong>penny priddy</strong>: Buckaroo…you look awful.</p>
