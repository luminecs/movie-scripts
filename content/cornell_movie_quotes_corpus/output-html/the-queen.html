<p><strong>commentary</strong>: ..here’s Tony Blair, just 43 years</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: And I don’t mind telling you, it wasn’t for
Mr Blair.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not a moderniser, then?</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Certainly not. We’re in danger of losing too
much that’s good about this country as it is.</p>
<p><strong>tv commentary</strong>: “The only questions that still
remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping
will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?”</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I rather envy you being able to vote. Not
the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to
experience that ONCE. But the sheer joy of being partial.</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Yes..</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not
entitled to vote.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Still, you won’t catch me feeling sorry for
you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma’am.. But it IS your
Government.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I suppose that is some consolation.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: G’morning, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dresser</strong>: Shall I draw the curtains?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Did you stay up?</p>
<p><strong>dresser</strong>: Yes, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And? Was it as expected..?</p>
<p><strong>resser</strong>: Yes, Ma’am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>full frame</strong>: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new
Prime Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it were.
Headlines tell us..</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: The Prime Minister is on his way,
Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He’s a hard one to read, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Yes. On the one hand his background is
quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at
Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, we’ll try not to hold that against
him.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: On the other, his manifesto promises the
most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three
hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh. Is he going to `modernise’ us, do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I wouldn’t put it past him. He’s married to
a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her
curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as
`shallow’.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I don’t measure the depth of a curtsey,
Robin. I leave that to my sister.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who
said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very
informal. Everyone on first name terms. At the Prime Minister’s
insistence.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? As in `Call me Tony?’</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh. I’m not sure I like the sound of
that. Have we sent him a protocol sheet?</p>
<p><strong>archive footage</strong>: as TONY BLAIR’s motorcade drives
down the</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Funny, I’m actually rather nervous.</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: hy? You’ve met her often enough before.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I know. But never one to one. And never as
Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Remember, you’re a man that’s just been
elected by the whole country.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes. But she’s still, y’know..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: The Queen.</p>
<p><strong>equerry</strong>: When we reach the audience room, I will
knock. We will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside.
Standing by the door, we bow. From the neck. I will introduce you. The
Queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes..</p>
<p><strong>equerry</strong>: And when you’re in the Presence, at no
point must you show your back.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: The `Presence’?</p>
<p><strong>equerry</strong>: Yes, Sir. That’s what it’s called, when
you’re in her Majesty’s company.</p>
<p><strong>equerry</strong>: Mr Blair, your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ongratulations.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Thank you, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Your children must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’ve three, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How lovely. Such a blessing.
Children.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So..Have we shown you how to start a
nuclear war yet?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: First thing we do, I believe. Then we
take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the
world.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You obviously know my job better than I
do.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr
Blair. I’d like to think there weren’t too many surprises left. My first
was Winston Churchill. He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat,
and was kind enough to give a shy</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: young girl like me quite an education.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ith time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us
to execute our constitutional responsibility. To advise, guide and warn
the government of the day.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Advice which I look forward to receiving.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ell, we will save that for our weekly
meetings. Now, if there’s nothing else, I believe we have some business
to attend to..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Of course..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Your Majesty, the country has spoken…and I
come now to ask your permiss.. E</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No, no, no. It’s usual for ME to ask the
questions.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mr Blair, the people have elected you to
be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask
you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Generally, this is where you say
`yes.’</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: `Yes’.</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And exhausted, I imagine. Where will you
be spending the summer?</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: France.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How lovely.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ou’ll be in Balmoral, I expect.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful
place.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My great, great grandmother said of it -
“In Balmoral all seems to breathe freedom and peace and to make one
forget the world and its sad turmoils.”</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not too short, was it? I gave him fifteen
minutes. One doesn’t want to be rude.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: “Thank you so much for coming. Now bugger
off.”</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I know. What was all that about?</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Diana. Apparently she’s got a new
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>cnn newsreader</strong>: Dodi Al-Fayed is the son of Egyptian
millionaire Mohammed Al-Fayed, a man whom the English establishment has
repeatedly denied a British passport..</p>
<p><strong>german newsreader</strong>: The Princess and Mr Fayed were
hugging and kissing in full view of the world’s press yesterday..</p>
<p><strong>french newsreader</strong>: ..the couple then left for Paris.
At one point, the Princess told gathered reporters to watch out. Her
next move would really surprise them…</p>
<p><strong>rench reporter</strong>: ..the Princess of Wales and Dodi
Fayed returned to Paris earlier today..</p>
<p><strong>erman reporter</strong>: ..where they visited a local
jewellery shop where unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Fayed had been
looking at engagement rings..</p>
<p><strong>cctv footage</strong>: the unmistakable blonde hair of the
PRINCESS of WALES as she enters the Ritz Hotel through revolving
doors.</p>
<p><strong>axt. ritz hotel - night</strong>: German REPORTER
continues..</p>
<p><strong>german reporter</strong>: …they have now been inside the
hotel for more than two hours. We believe they have been dining in a
suite on the fifth floor..</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: We’ve just been told the Princess
is about to come out of the hotel..</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t bother following. You won’t catch
us.</p>
<p><strong>all around them</strong>: the glare of Paparazzi motorcycles
and camera flashbulbs around the car. The Paparazzi call out in French
and Italian. They thump the window. It’s terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Robin Janvrin.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Tell Sir Guy I’d like everyone in. As soon
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>dresser</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>dresser</strong>: Mr Janvrin is here to see you..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: What the..?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Good evening, Ma’am. I’m sorry to
disturb..</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: ’ve just had a call from our Embassy in Paris.
It’s…the Princess of Wales.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Why? What’s she done now?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What? How badly?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I see. Who are we speaking to there?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Right. Keep me posted.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s Diana. She’s been in a car accident. In
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Is it serious?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: Let’s just re-cap on what’s
happened.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: What was she doing in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ou know what she’s like.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s quite awful… What are you going to
do about the boys?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Let them sleep until we know more.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes that’s sensible.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I should go to Paris. I told my people to
start organising a jet.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? A private one?</p>
<p><strong>harles</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Isn’t that precisely the sort of
extravagance they attack us for?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: ell, how else am I going to get to Paris at
this time of night? The airport at Aberdeen will be closed.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: You can use the Royal Flight. They
keep one of the planes on permanent stand-by. In case I kick the
bucket.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Out of the question. It’s not a matter of
State.</p>
<p><strong>harles</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a member
of the Royal Family. This is a private matter.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: She’s mother to your grandchildren.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: That’s the latest?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t hear..
Everyone’s shouting!</p>
<p><strong>television</strong>: ..behind me, is the tunnel of the Pont
de l’Alma, which you reach by the expressway along the Seine. It was
along here that the Mercedes carrying the Princess..</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: The Ambassador, in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Good evening, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Right. I see.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I’ve just spoken to our Ambassador in
Paris, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: No, no, no, no..!</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: struggling in vain to hold onto his
composure, a BRITISH NEWSREADER relays the news, visibly in shock..</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: We have just had confirmation, that
Diana, Princess of Wales.. ..has died in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>cnn anchor</strong>: “I’m afraid we have some bad news to
report..”</p>
<p><strong>nn anchor</strong>: “Diana, Princess of Wales, is dead.”</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What have I got on this week?</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: You’re writing your maiden Conference
speech as Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, let’s cancel everything else. This is
going to be massive. I’d better make a statement in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: You’ll be pleased to know I’ve already
started coming up with ideas.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: God, she’s only been dead an hour!</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Would you prefer I didn’t do my job?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: They’re going to go back to sleep. Well,
try anyway.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: My Private Secretary’s office has found a
travel agency open in New York that will sell me a flight to Paris with
an hour’s stop over in Manchester.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Perhaps now you might consider whether it’s
still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future King of
England in one of our planes?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I don’t want the boys to see the news and
get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of
their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery.</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of
light.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Well, well, well.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Ye-es.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: hope you told her to come back? Cut</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: an’t imagine she was pleased.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: That’s putting it mildly.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Something about Diana managing to be
even more annoying dead than alive.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Just make sure the boys never hear you
talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No. I’m going to do my diary a little
longer.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Fine. I’ll sleep next door.</p>
<p><strong>axt. myrobella - day</strong>: Victorian, red-brick house. In
the driveway, the</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “..that’s how she will remain. In our minds,
our hearts, forever.” OK, got it.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Where will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I thought at church. On the way in.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: breaking news: Diana’s brother, EARL SPENCER,
makes a statement from the gates outside his house in South Africa..</p>
<p><strong>pencer</strong>: …this is not a time for recriminations,
however I would say that I always believed that the press would kill her
in the end.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Not the press, mate. You’ve got the wrong
villain.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: You about to speak to the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Now, now..</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey set CHARLES’s place and his breakfast, .</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb, Ma’am, but I’ve the
Prime Minister, for you. From his constituency.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: without looking up from</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you, Robin. I’ll take it next
door.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he QUEEN gets to her feet and walks out
into..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Good morning, your Majesty. May I say right
away how very sorry I am - and that the thoughts and prayers of my
family are with you at this terrible time and with the two princes in
particular.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Is it your intention to make some kind of
appearance. Or statement?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No member of the Royal family will speak
publicly about this. It is a private matter and we would all appreciate
it if it could be respected as such.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I don’t suppose anyone has had time to think
about the funeral yet?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We’ve spoken to the Spencer family, and
it’s their wish.. ..their express wish, that it should be a private
funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Given that Diana was no longer a member
of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You don’t feel that in view of her high
profile and popularity.. …it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life
and achievements? Or even just to her as a mother?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: As I said. That’s the Spencers’ wish.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You don’t think a private funeral would be
denying them a chance..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: hance to what..?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: To share in the grief?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not a
fairground attraction. I think the Princess has already paid a high
enough price for exposure to the press, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Her instinct is to do nothing. Say nothing.
And give her a private funeral.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Are you surprised? She hated her guts.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, I think it’s a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: They screwed up her life. Let’s hope they
don’t screw up her death.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The Chaplain called. Wanted to know
whether he should make any changes to the service or make special
mention of Diana.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I told him he shouldn’t change a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: uite right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I think the less fuss one makes, or draws
attention to it, the better. For the boys.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And we should probably arrange some
company for them. Some young people.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I’ll take them for a long walk this
afternoon. Up Craggy Head.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Good. They’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Alastair? He’s on..</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: TONY, wearing a dark suit, and tie, takes his
position in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, in front of the
cameras.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: e are today a nation in a state of shock, in
mourning, in grief that is so deeply painful to us. People everywhere,
not just here in Britain, kept faith with Princess Diana..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: They liked her, they loved her, they regarded
her as one of the people. She was the people’s princess, and that is how
she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and memories
forever..”</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: ANVRIN’s eyes roll privately..</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: A bit over the top, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Notre Pere qui es aux cieux, Que ton nom
soit sanctifie, Que ton regne vienne, Que ta volonte soit faite,</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ur la terre comme au ciel..</p>
<p><strong>clinton</strong>: I’ll always be glad I knew the Princess,
and hope everyone will support her two fine sons and help them have the
life and the future she would want..</p>
<p><strong>mandela</strong>: I had the honour of hosting her a few
months ago when she visited our country, and I was tremendously
impressed by her..</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: In cities all around the world, shrines
have been created, in a spontaneous, worldwide outpouring of grief.</p>
<p><strong>ide</strong>: Lord Airlie.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: TONY shoots a look, `Who?’ The AIDE covers the
phone..</p>
<p><strong>ide</strong>: The Lord Chamberlain. In charge of the funeral.
You’re meeting him at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Lord Airlie.</p>
<p><strong>airlie</strong>: Prime Minister. I’m responsible for
organising all royal ceremonial events… And there’s simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Then perhaps we should plan for any
contingency.</p>
<p><strong>ord airlie</strong>: Yes. I’ve arranged a meeting tomorrow
morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace. Officials from all three palaces,
representatives from the Spencer Family, the emergency services. Would
you send some of your people?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Absolutely. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: `Preeecedent?’</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Where do they find these people?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m so sorry, Sir. And if there’s anything I
or my Government can do…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: They stood up as we drove past…in cafes…in
restaurants. Removed their hats. This was Paris. One of the busiest
cities in the world…and you could hear a pin drop…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I imagine it will be the same here.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes…I imagine it will.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The Palace would still prefer to see it as
a private funeral. What are your feelings on that?</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: I think that would present us with
difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>harles</strong>: So do I. My mother.. …the Queen, comes from
a generation not best equipped to… …she grew up in the war… I think what
we need, what the COUNTRY needs is to be led by someone..”of today”. If
you follow? Balmoral is..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I think I understand.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: PRINCE CHARLES is greeted by PRESIDENT CHIRAC
on the steps of the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Have we heard from the Spencers again?
Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be?</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Not me. No one tells me anything.</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: The Prince of Wales spent half an hour
at the hospital. At 5.06, the party left with Diana’s coffin..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: n our walk today, one of the ghillies
said he’d seen a large stag up at Craghie Head. He reckoned fourteen
points.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: What? Really? We haven’t had one that
big on this estate in years.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: No. Quite.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: CHARLES’s plane arrives back in England.</p>
<p><strong>ewsreader</strong>: Diana’s coffin arrived back in London, at
RAF Northolt, two hours later..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: nyway, I thought it might be a good
distraction. For the boys.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? Stalking?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I think anything that gets them
outside is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: arlier today, the Prime Minister made a
statement from his constituency..</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: TONY making his speech outside the church in
Trimdon. We CLOSE on the QUEEN’s face as she hears..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “They liked her. They loved her. They regarded
her as one of the People. She was the People’s Princess, and that is how
she will remain in our hearts forever..”</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t bear it. I’m going to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: ORD AIRLIE, , checks the time. It’s ten o’clock.
He raps on a table, calling the meeting to order..</p>
<p><strong>lord airlie</strong>: Right. It’s ten o’clock. Let’s make a
start. Thank you all for coming at such notice. I think we all agree
this is an extraordinarily sensitive occasion which presents us with
tremendous challenges logistically…</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Oh, Christ..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “..after eighteen years of Opposition, of
frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as
the new Prime Minister…”</p>
<p><strong>ide</strong>: Labour Prime Minister..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “I want to set an ambitious course to
modernise this country. To breathe new life into our institutions. To
make privilege something for the many, not the few. So that we become
nothing less than a beacon to the world…”</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: Bloody hell! You think the Royals are
nutters! You should meet their flunkeys! Two and a half-hours on whether
she should be carried in a hearse or a gun-carriage. Anyway, raves in
the press.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: This lot call you “The Nation’s Mourner in
Chief”, this lot say you’re “The only person who has correctly judged
the mood of the country”. Even the “Mail”.. ..was impressed.</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: “People’s Princess”, mate. You owe me.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Gordon for you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Tell him to hang on.</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The Abbey. The
works.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be
despatched. Grovelling on all fours.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Good morning, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: ..Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What can we do for you, Robin?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Ma’am, there was a meeting at the Palace
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: About the funeral arrangements, yes.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these plans
for you to consider.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: There is now general agreement, Ma’am, that
a public funeral would be more appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: nd what form will it take?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: At the moment, they’re suggesting.. And of
course these are early days..</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Tay Bridge..?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What..?</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: B-but that’s the code name for my
funeral? J</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: ndeed, Ma’am. But it would be for practical
reasons only.</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: It’s the only one which has been..
..`rehearsed’. The only one that could be put together..in time.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: But I supervised those plans
myself.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at
pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. For
example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin,
the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess’s
various charities march behind the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I see..</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: And that instead of foreign Heads of State
and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of
actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other..
…celebrities..</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Celebrities..?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: o, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police
Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book.
It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them
easier.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, of course..</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Oh, and the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hat flowers?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Fine. Then move them away.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was
wondering whether we shouldn’t leave the flowers, and send the Guards
through the North Gate.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Ye-es. Of course. Quite right.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: tephen Lamport on one.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The Prince of Wales’s private secretary. In
Balmoral. He said it was urgent.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ood afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>lamport</strong>: Good afternoon, Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>lamport</strong>: The Prince of Wales wanted me to thank you
again for your kind words yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>amport</strong>: He feels you and he…are modern men…of
similar mind… …who could work well together at this difficult time.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, please thank his Highness, and assure
him that he can count on my full support. At all times. Was that it?</p>
<p><strong>lamport</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Creeping up to me like this. He did it at the
airport when he asked me to `deal’ with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>aide #2</strong>: ecause he knows that if the Queen continues
to get it wrong over Diana, it won’t be long before the Royals become
public enemy no 1. Terrified of being shot, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Who, Charles?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: His people have already been onto us asking
for extra protection.</p>
<p><strong>ide #2</strong>: He probably thinks if he’s seen to be on our
side, the Queen will be the one left in the firing line, not him.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What? So it’s OK for his mother to take the
bullet, not him? What a family.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Wait! Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Up at Craigghead.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I thought you were going to get a new</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: one of these?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What for? It’s perfectly all right.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I was thinking last night what Diana might
have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: She would certainly have taken the boys to
Paris. I rather regret not doing that now.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? And expose them to the media? It
would have been a dreadful thing to do. They’re much better off
here.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Look, whatever else you may have thought of
Diana - she was a wonderful mother. She adored those boys. And never let
them forget it. Always warm.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: And physical. Never afraid to show her
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Especially whenever a photographer was in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that, but
still..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not `us’, dear.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back
into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don’t mind telling you I
thought it was a gun.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why don’t you go on without me? I’m going
to walk back..</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes. It looks like rain.. And I’m not in
the mood for stalking anyway.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don’t
want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? You wouldn’t get any proper
walks then.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Right. Done. Now who knows the way
home?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You clever things!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I spoke to Charles this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Who was good enough to share with me his
views on motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin,
panda-eyes,</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How wonderful Diana was.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: That’s changing his tune.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What a natural.</p>
<p><strong>iana</strong>: ..I think..they see me as a threat of some
kind..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Oh, for God’s sake..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Maybe he’s got a point. Maybe we are
partly to blame.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I can’t watch this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No, wait. Leave it.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: “Every strong woman in history has had to
walk down a similar path..”</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We encouraged the match. And signed off
on it. Both of us. You were very enthusiastic, remember.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: She was a nice girl. Then.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: “And I think it’s this strength that causes
the confusion and the fear.”</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: And I was sure he’d give the other
one up. Or, at least make sure his wife towed the line. Isn’t that what
everyone does?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: “Why is she strong? Where is she getting it
from? Where is she going to take it? How is she going to use it?”</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: British historian DAVID STARKEY is
lambasting CHARLES. TONY and CHERIE sit on the sofa, watching
television, eating pasta on their knees. STARKEY defends the QUEEN. Part
of an older generation. She knows no better.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hat?</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: ..I don’t know…something more interesting.
Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: A bunch of freeloading, emotionally
retarded…nutters.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s just absurd.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of
privilege and wealth. They don’t pay tax.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes, they do.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty, forty
million a year..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ot you, too. Look…if you want to have a
serious conversation about this..</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: I do..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ..about the Constitution..</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: e don’t HAVE one..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …or about ways in which we as a Government
could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: If you’re going, take the dishes..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But spare me the whole..”off with their heads”
thing.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Because it insults your intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: “The case for reform is simple and obvious.
It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on
the basis of birth, not merit or election.” YOUR words, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, maybe now I’ve grown up. It’s
unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Because…no would would wear it. No one WANTS
it. It’s just…daft.</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: It’s not a mother thing, is it?</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Think about it. If she were still alive,
wouldn’t Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your
mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The
fact she was brought up in the way. Well c’mon..? Who does THAT sound
like?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m going to do the washing-up. F</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: All right, the good news is that the
Palace has agreed to video screens in the Royal Parks.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Crash barriers.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: hey’re now predicting more than two
million people will descend on London, and there aren’t enough barriers
to line the route. So we’ve gone cap in hand to the French for theirs.
And there’s something else I think you should see.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a
television plays in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are
watching, recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks.
Informal.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Can we run that piece again? You’re going
to love this.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Look, I know all this..</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Don’t tell me. There isn’t a flag flying at
half mast above Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: God. Will someone save these people from
themselves..</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: ine. I’ll call Balmoral…</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: `Planet Zog’?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Because as Prime Minister of this country,
I’ve really got nothing better to do..</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her
dogs. She</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Those fire-lighters no good? I brought
some stew just in case. I think it’s lamb. We could always have that
cold..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: No, we’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Robin had a call from the Prime Minister.
Who expressed his concern.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: About WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The flag above Buckingham Palace. He
thinks it should be flying at half- mast.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: Then I hope Robin told him there ISN’T
a flag above Buckingham Palace… …only the Royal Standard, which flies
for one reason only.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Isn’t it possible..that to some people…the
Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare
sends out the wrong signal.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: The point is it’s more than four
hundred years old. It has never been lowered for ANYONE..</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Your grandfather didn’t get that flag
at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she
wouldn’t get it either.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes…but sometimes…in a situation like
this..one has to be flexible..</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: It is just a flag.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: “What about the Union Jack?”, was
Mr. Blair’s next suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>ueen mother</strong>: Oh, for heaven’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: The next thing he’ll be suggesting
you change your name to Hilda and mine to Hector? Who does he think he’s
talking to? You’re the Sovereign. The Head of State. You don’t get
dictated to. You’ve conceded the idea of a public funeral. You’ve opened
up the parks. That’s ENOUGH.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Like those condolence books.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Quite right. When we started with
one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we’ve heard
nothing more about that, see?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Apparently there are now fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What..?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: And people are queuing through the
night.</p>
<p><strong>harles</strong>: In one sense its comforting. For the first
time my parents can see what it’s been like for me all these years,
being up against her popularity. But they’re still making the mistake of
thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will
eventually be the one seen by the public. But it’s not. The two Dianas,
theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’ve been thinking is the flag flying at
half mast over my house at Highgrove?</p>
<p><strong>lamport</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Make sure we get a picture of that in the
papers, would you? If my mother wants to make a mess of this, that’s her
business. I won’t let her drag me down, too.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Tony Blair in London. TONY and CHERIE watch..</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: See? It isn’t just me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: People really DO want change. And want YOU
to give it to them.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And do what? Cut off their heads?</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: Apparently, one in six people now support the
idea of getting rid of the Monarchy.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s just the papers spoiling for a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: But still, imagine this country without
them? With a nice elected Head of State? That’d be some legacy. If the
revolution were to happen on your watch.</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: That’s the stalking party off?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Right, we’d better have a look at these
papers.</p>
<p><strong>ecretary</strong>: “Show us there’s a heart in the House of
Windsor,” says the Sun..</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: It proves, the Royals are not like us”,
the Mirror. “Time to change the Old Guard at Buckingham Palace”.
Express.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: God..</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: “One can’t help wondering who’s advice
they are taking for it’s clearly the wrong advice…”</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: “People have been yearning for a change in
this country.” Good. “The result is a quiet revolution now taking place.
Led by the real modernisers. The British People..”</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: TONY tails off..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: `Revolution’? Not you, too? Who wrote
this?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Where does it come from?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Where does it come from?</p>
<p><strong>ide 2</strong>: Just look at the papers. Talk to people on
the streets.</p>
<p><strong>ide</strong>: Something’s happening out there.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Revolution.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Right. You lot. Out.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: What about the speech?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: ..and finally, Ma’am, a DSO medal. A
Corporal, in Kosovo..you may have read about it in the papers..pulled
two civilians from a bus after a bomb blast.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Hurry up, dear. Getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Yes, Ma’am. Just the letter of condolence
to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Ma’am, apparently the Prime Minister is on
the phone for you.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: Tell him to call back.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No, I’d better take it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Good afternoon, your Majesty. I’m sorry to
disturb. I was just wondering..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …whether you’d seen any of today’s papers?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We’ve managed to look at one or two,
yes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: In which case, my next question would be -
whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Under normal circumstances I would agree,
but..P</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: Here we go! The bloody flag
again..!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: ..my advisers have been taking the temperature
among people on the streets - and the information I’m getting is that
the mood.. …is quite delicate.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Of course. That’s where all the ruddy
cameras are.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So what would you suggest, Prime
Minister? Some kind of statement?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: No, Ma’am. I believe the moment for statements
has passed.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I would suggest flying the flag at half-mast
above Buckingham Palace…</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: See!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And coming down to London at the earliest
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It would be a great comfort to your people and
would help them with their grief.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: THEIR grief?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If you’re suggesting that I drop
everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have
just lost their mother..you’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: Absurd.. E</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I doubt there are many who know the
British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their
wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject
this `mood’ which has been stirred up by the press…in favour of a period
of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. That’s the way we do
things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. It’s what the rest of the
world has always admired us for.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, if that’s your decision, Ma’am, of
course the government will support it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes. Let’s.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Bloody fool.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Now your tea’s gone cold.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: TONY hangs up the phone. He is lost in thought.
His SECRETARY sticks her head around the door..</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Robin Janvrin on one. He must have been
listening in.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Mr Janvrin?</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Prime Minister, I understand how
<code>difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how</code>unhelpful’..but
try to see it from her perspective.. She’s been brought up to believe
its God’s will that she is who she is.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I think we should leave God out of it. It’s
just not helpful.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: She won’t have seen anything like this
since the Abdication.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: All right - but first we have to deal with
these terrible headlines. I’ll see what I can do with the Press.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I’m most grateful, Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But I can’t promise anything. It’s not me they
want to see.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Ask Alistair to come and see me will you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: nd cancel whatever I’m doing tonight.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, you are stupid.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hello? Could you put me through to the
Ghillies’ office?</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: ello, Thomas? I’m afraid I’ve done</p>
<p><strong>head ghillie</strong>: Are you sure, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the
rear. I’ve lost the four-wheel drive. You forget I worked as a mechanic
in the war.</p>
<p><strong>head ghillie</strong>: And are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, perfectly, thank you. I’m so sorry
to waste your time..</p>
<p><strong>head ghilie</strong>: We’ll come out straightaway.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you.
I’ll wait by the car.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into
her jacket pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes.
Gradually, she composes herself.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, you are a beauty.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: I’ve just been told there are news crews
outside waiting for you to come and “speak to the people.”</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>herie</strong>: What’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I told the Queen’s private secretary I’d do
what I could to help with the press.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Why? Don’t you think she deserves it?
Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I know…but allowing her to hang herself might
not be in our best interests either.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Besides, I think there’s something…ugly about
the way everyone’s started to bully her.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he QUEEN is in bed, watching television.
Staring.</p>
<p><strong>n screen</strong>: television footage of TONY BLAIR, shaking
hands with `the people’, defending the QUEEN, helping MOURNERS with
their grief..</p>
<p><strong>v presenter</strong>: ..earlier tonight the Prime Minister
went out and pleaded with people to understand the Royals’
behaviour..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How are the boys?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Not so good tonight. A lot of
slamming doors. I think they saw the papers.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, no..</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: television footage of FAMILIES sleeping
in parks. Kensington Palace is a sea of flowers and tributes. The MALL
is lined with singing, hugging, weeping MOURNERS of all ages and
nationalities, holding candles..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I’ll take them out early again
tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>tv interviewer</strong>: Where have you come from?</p>
<p><strong>mourner 1</strong>: Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>tv interviewer</strong>: Hamburg, Germany?</p>
<p><strong>ourner 1</strong>: Well, I just had to be here. She was such
a wonderful woman..</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mourner 2</strong>: She was an angel..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: …and a hysteric.</p>
<p><strong>mourner 3</strong>: o compassionate, and caring..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Oh, please..</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: And they think we’re mad?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: I suggest you keep it that way. A
chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: That’ll be a first for Westminster
Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Condolence books are now being signed
in our embassies in every major city in the world. And in London alone
the number has reached forty.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: stares at the CROWDS of MOURNERS on
the</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: silence. The TELEVISION coverage continues..</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: So it’s VITAL you hold firm. Stick to
your guns. You wait. They will come to their senses soon. They HAVE
to.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: C’mon, move over, Cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>elevision presenter</strong>: It’s six o’clock. Time for a
look at the morning’s newspapers. Jenny..</p>
<p><strong>we cut to</strong>: a smiling woman in her thirties, who sits
at a coffee table which is covered in newspapers..</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Good morning. Well if you thought yesterday’s
headlines for the Royals couldn’t get any worse - think again.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he Sun - “Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?”
The Express, “Show us you care”, with a picture of a grumpy Queen. The
Mail - “Let the Flag Fly at half- mast”, and inside, “The Queen should
be here to show her respects.”</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: Blimey! But the flip-side is… “Blair more
popular than Churchill shock.”</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Did any of them pick up on our statement of
support?</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Just one.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Right..</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: The Prime Minister for you, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I’m afraid he’s rather insisting.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: All right. I’ll take it here. In the
kitchens.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ood morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Good morning, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Then I’m sure you’ll agree. The situation has
become quite critical.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Ma’am, a poll that’s to be published in
tomorrow’s paper suggests 70% of people believe your actions have
damaged the monarchy and one in four are now in favour of abolishing the
monarchy altogether.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: As your Prime Minister, I believe it’s my
constitutional responsibility to ADVISE the following..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mummy?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: One - lower the flag to half-mast above
Buckingham Palace and all other Royal residences. Two - leave Balmoral,
and fly down to London at the earliest opportunity. Three - pay respects
in person at Diana’s coffin. And four - make a statement via live
television to my people and the world.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: bviously you’re going to have to talk
to the Lord Chamberlain about all this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>ueen mother</strong>: And to Robert Fellowes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: To him too.</p>
<p><strong>ueen mother</strong>: And..?</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Something’s happened. There’s been a
change…a shift of values..</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Certainly not! Remember the oath you
took</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: “I declare that my whole life, whether it
be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.”</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Your WHOLE life. That’s a commitment
to God as well as your people.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But if my actions are damaging the
crown?</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: Damaging them? My dear, you are the
greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER
had. The problem will come when you leave, but that’s not for you to
worry about - and certainly not today.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mummy..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s just no one seems to value tradition
or constancy any more. It’s all about show. About wearing your heart on
your sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>queen mother</strong>: And you’re not like that. Never have
been. No…you must show strength. Re- assert your authority. You sit on
the most powerful throne in Europe. Head of an unbroken line that goes
back more than a thousand years. How many of your predecessors do you
imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to London because
people holding candles wanted help with their grief?</p>
<p><strong>ueen mother</strong>: And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire
Cat grin…</p>
<p><strong>ghillie</strong>: Mr Janvrin for you sir.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Yes Robin….?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: What? It’s madness! The whole thing!
Bloody madness!</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: It seems we are going back to
London!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’ve just been told. You’ve decided to go
back to London.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he QUEEN’s face. Avoids eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I just want to say - I admire… I think it’s
the right decision.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Let’s hope we haven’t left it too late.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their
photo-call. The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four..</p>
<p><strong>news reader</strong>: We are just getting some pictures now
from Balmoral. These are rather historic shots. Clearly the Queen has
responded to criticism that the Royal Family is not engaged..</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Thank God for that.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Be right there.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: I’m afraid they’re a bit burned.</p>
<p><strong>rince philip</strong>: Where are the boys? Have they already
left?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes. They left for London after
breakfast. With Charles.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: It’s not right, you know</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, but further discussion is no longer
helpful either.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Oh, well. I suppose it gives the
ghillies time to find a new stag for the boys now theirs has been
shot.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Haven’t you heard? It wandered onto
one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the
commercial guests.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Really..?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Here’s your box. There’s some important
policy unit stuff on top. And you’ve seen the papers?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m the Prime Minister. Of course I’ve seen
the papers.</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: “Your Maj? Come down to London.” “Who says
so?” “Tony Blair.”</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: “Mr. Father of the Nation.”</p>
<p><strong>head gillie</strong>: Morning, Ma’am. Is it his Lordship
you’ve come to see?</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e reaches into his pockets for his
cell-phone..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No, no..please don’t disturb him. I’ve
come on another matter. I hope you don’t mind..</p>
<p><strong>head gillie</strong>: There he is..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: e was wounded.</p>
<p><strong>head gillie</strong>: Yes. We got our guest in very close,
had him lined-up perfect, and still.. ..an investment banker, Ma’am.
From London.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let’s hope he didn’t suffer too much.</p>
<p><strong>head gillie</strong>: I will, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>head gillie</strong>: God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, Robin..</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: I’ve done a draft of your television
address.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: No, Ma’am. Landing in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’ve got a copy of the Queen’s
speech.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Shall I give Tony a copy?</p>
<p><strong>lastair</strong>: Let me have a look at it first.</p>
<p><strong>prince philip</strong>: Good God..</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: the QUEEN and PHILIP are looking at
bouquets laid at the gates of the palace, reading messages and
inscriptions..</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: They sent a copy of the Queen’s
speech.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: You might want to scrape the frost off it
first.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: I made a couple of changes. So it sounds
like it comes from a human being.</p>
<p><strong>alastair</strong>: Oh, and one bit of good news. The old
boot’s FINALLY agreed to pay respects at Diana’s coffin.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You know when you get it wrong, you REALLY get
it wrong. That woman has given her whole life in service to her people -
fifty years doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job she watched kill her
father. She’s executed it with dignity, honour and, as far as I can
tell, without a single blemish - and now we line up baying for her blood
- why? Because she’s struggling to lead the world in mourning for a
woman who threw everything she offered back in her face, and who seemed,
in the last few years, to be committed twenty-four seven to destroy
everything she holds dear.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh..hello.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: They’re for you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: For me..?</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes
the flowers, then turns and walks away, visibly shaken..</p>
<p><strong>anvrin</strong>: Your Majesty, there’s a last minute addition
from Downing Street. They’re suggesting adding `..and as a
grandmother..’ here.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: You think you can say it?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do I have a choice?</p>
<p><strong>irector</strong>: We’re ready for you, your Majesty..</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Just to confirm this is going out
live.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Right</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And you’ll be at the front of the six
o’clock news on all the channels</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Ten seconds, everyone..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Since last Saturday’s dreadful news we
have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana’s death..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We have all been trying in our different
ways to cope. The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other
feelings. Disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those who
remain.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We have all felt these emotions in these
last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a
grandmother, I say from my heart…</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: “Heart”? What “heart”. She doesn’t mean a
word of this.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s not the point. What she’s doing is
extraordinary. That’s how you survive.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Listen to you! A week ago you were the great
moderniser, making speeches about the “People’s Princess”, now you’ve
gone weak at the knees.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: I don’t know why I’m surprised. In the end,
all Labour Prime Ministers go ga- ga for her Maj.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever
we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana’s loss, and gratitude for
her all-too-short life.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And we’re out..!</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: IRECTOR</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting,
elegiac hymn..</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he entire distraught, tearful NATION it seems,
has come out onto the streets to pay their final respects.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: So? Off to see your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Now, now..</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: I hope she shows you some respect this time.
It’s quite a debt of gratitude she owes you.</p>
<p><strong>cherie</strong>: Mr “Saviour of the Monarchy.”</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: doubt she’ll see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Robin. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>janvrin</strong>: Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Tony, please..</p>
<p><strong>equerry</strong>: The Prime Minister, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do sit down.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s good to see you again. After quite a
summer..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I meant to tell you at the time but you were
being monopolised rather.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I imagine those occasions are quite difficult.
Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private
audience..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Also, we haven’t had a chance to speak since
THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Whatever for?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: In case you’d felt
<code>manhandled' or</code>managed’ in any way.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I don’t think I shall ever understand
what happened this summer.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: The circumstances were exceptional, Ma’am. And
in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility.
E</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ou’re confusing humility with
humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You didn’t hear what they were saying in
the Mall that Friday.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I still believe History will show it was a
good week for you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And an even better one for you, Mr
Blair.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But there are fifty-two weeks in a year,
Ma’am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And when people come to assess your legacy, no
one will remember those few days.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You don’t feel that what respect or
affection people might once have had for..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: ..this institution has been
diminished?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I gather some of your closest advisors
were less fulsome in their support..</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: One or two. But as a leader one has…a
different perspective. I could never have added my voice to the
chorus.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re very kind.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But let’s also not forget the more
pragmatic reason.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That without me there to distract
everyone, it’d suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked
power the British Prime Minister actually has.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If fifty years of doing MY job has taught
me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with
all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. Just look at the
French.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Good. The clocks go back next week, then
it’ll be dark by five.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: As a matter of fact, it’s how I think
best. On my feet. I’ve never been one for sitting around endlessly. A
good walk and fresh air sorts everything out..</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid
of me? T</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: For about half an hour. But then you came down
to London and all that went away.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’ve never been hated like that
before.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: No. And that must have been difficult.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It was. Very.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Ever since Diana people want glamour and
tears..the grand performance..and I’m not very good at that. I prefer to
keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that’s what people
wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one’s heart on
one’s sleeve, duty first… self second.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s how I was brought up. It’s all I’ve
ever known</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: One forgets. You were so young when you became
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I was. A girl.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But I can see the world has changed. And
one must ‘modernise’.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, perhaps that’s where I can help.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Don’t get ahead of yourself Prime-
minister, I think you’ll find that I’m supposed to be advising YOU!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So…what might we expect in your first
Parliament?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, Ma’am, top of the list is education
reform. We want to radically reduce classroom sizes…</p>
