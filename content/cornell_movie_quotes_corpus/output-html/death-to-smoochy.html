<p><strong>death to smoochy</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: ’Friends come in all sizes That’s a fact!
It’s True! All colors of the rainbow</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Their names may not be different One might
say ‘grasp’ while the Some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch…
Beeee- Friends come in all sizes Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size From a
pal who is true and can You can count on him and he can It’s true… that…
Friends come in all sizes!’</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: So… uh… you’ll make sure my boy dances up
front, right? Where he’ll get the most camera time?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You want your kid on the show?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Of… of course.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yes, very much.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Then don’t tell me how to run my fucking
business.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: No, no, we were just –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’ll call you if a spot opens up.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Freeze, you cocksucker!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Drop the briefcase!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Gentlemen, let me be the first to say, in
all sobriety, that I’m as shocked and outraged as all of –</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Save it for the papers, Stokes. We’ve got
nervous sponsors and an angry public – a combination uglier than two
monkeys fucking. What are you doing about it?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Well, sir, I’m currently in the process of
compiling a list of viable replacements and it’s my hope…</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Clean replacements? With background checks? I
assure you, Mr. Stokes, this network cannot survive another Rainbow
Randolph. The goddamn P.R. department looks like the Jim Jones camp.</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: Remember, Stokes, this was your dog
that crapped on our rug.</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: We trusted you, Frank. And now we’re
in a tight spot. We have to post our quarterly earnings next month, for
Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Whoever takes that slot has to be a straight
arrow. Clean as a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Right. Someone who’ll take the heat
off. One of those sweater types. Any chance of luring Fred Rogers away
from P.B.S.?</p>
<p><strong>executive #4</strong>: Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
truck.</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: No way. The idea now is to stop the
hemorrhaging.</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: You better fix this, Stokes. Get us a
white bread replacement, fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a speck of
controversy.</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Squeaky fucking clean.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Bumble Bee Billy?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Wife beater.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Square Dance Danny?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Still appealing the mail fraud thing.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Black was deported, and the trolls… well, who
gives a shit.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: This is impossible. If I ever see that Rainbow
Randolph again I’ll strangle him. Choke the life out of him. Squeeze his
scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the
walls…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Before indulging such cheery fantasies,
let’s just concentrate on saving my job. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sorry, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: What’s going on with Sheldon Mopes these
days.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh my God. Have we sunk to that level already?
Smoochy the Rhino? What a sap.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Sap’s just the pill we need right now. Mopes
is a straight arrow. Always has been.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The guy can’t get arrested, Frank. He can’t
even break into the birthday party circuit. Last I heard he was working
hospitals and nursing homes. He’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: The truth of the matter is, a successful
children’s show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy
costume and a lot of hype. Strip away the foam rubber and the network
money and they’re all jokes. Marginal talents.. cabaret acts… off-
Broadway runoff…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I probably have ten acts in my development
file – acts I’ve been cultivating – that are more deserving than Sheldon
Mopes.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: And each one a moral question mark.
Something I can’t risk at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: We can do better than this guy, Frank. He
brings nothing to the table.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Except ethics. With Mopes, there’s never
been a whiff of controversy. The man’s an ethical, harmless, cornball.
In short, a glass of milk on two legs.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Don’t ask me to do it. You know I’ll do
anything for you, but please… not this…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Go find Smoochy.</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: of ‘She’ll be Comin’</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Thanks, fellas. I’m rooting for you!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Mr. Mopes?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I, uh, saw your performance tonight. Very… …
spirited.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Really? Thanks. I would’ve done a longer
set if that guy hadn’t pulled a knife on the security guard. Once the
pepper spray starts flyin’, that’s it for the encores.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes, that did put a damper on the evening,
didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Are you a new patient? On the juice, as we
say?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Ah, no. But it’s sweet of you to assume
so.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: ‘Nora Bishop. V.P. of Development. Kidnet.’
Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: As stated.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Nora. A
real honor. Hey, you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Soy dogs… never thought I’d live to see the
day. Organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed. Although
I do feel bad for the beans. Just kidding. Sure you don’t want one?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Believe it or not, no.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: So anyway, like I was saying, people always
tell me, ‘You gotta network, Sheldon… you gotta sell yourself… or you’ll
be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.’
And you know what I tell ’em?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I haven’t the foggiest.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I tell ’em, it’s not about the old
handshake and back slap game. It’s not about adding fuel to the shlock
machine. It’s about doing good work. Having integrity. Making people
happy and delivering a positive message. Foundations are built with
concrete, not plaster of Paris!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: This is concrete! This is integrity!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Sorry. As you can imagine, living by your
convictions can be a little stressful at times.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: We all have our cross to bear.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: See, I was raised by my grandfather, and
Grandpop paved driveways for a living…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Are we going into a story?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thing is, he didn’t really pave them. Just
covered them with black paint. Of course, once the first rain came
along, people realized they’d been swindled. I vowed to myself back then
that I’d never make a living through deception. Never. Whadda ya think
of them apples?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The reason I’m here today, Mr. Mopes, as fate
would have it, Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with…
convictions. And integrity. Someone like…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: … yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t think I could top that one.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hold the phone. You’re telling me that
Kidnet is finally ready to do a show of Smoochy quality? Of Smoochy
caliber?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes… I believe we’re ready to push ourselves
to that level.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I knew this day would come! After all these
years I finally meet someone in the business who gets what I do. Who
gets what I’m all about. You get me, don’t you, Nora?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, Miss V.P. of Development… let’s go
make history!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Angelo, you were always my favorite Krinkle
Kid. The way you’d click your heels during the ‘Jellybean Jam.’ Real
artistry. I’m honored to have you as a Rhinette.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: A job’s a job.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Hey, kids! Who’s your favorite rhino?</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Smoochy!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Hiya, kids!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Hi, Smoochy!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: It’s gonna be a fantabulous day in
Smoochyland!!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: ‘Ohhhh… it’s a fantabulous day in
Smoochy-land/Let’s have a great big cheer for the Smoochy-land
band/We’ll dance with our jungle pals, won’t that be grand/Oh, it’s a
fantabulous day in Smoochy- land!’</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I was starting to think that maybe you
weren’t coming.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: I agreed to meet you, didn’t I? I had a
dinner engagement.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Really? You know, I used to have dinner
engagements. Sometimes four, five a night. Dinner… drinks… I was the
toast of the fucking town.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Don’t start, Randolph. Please.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Cars, boats, whores and horses, I had ’em
all. When I walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. When
I stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. I’d walk down the
street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. You know why? You know why,
Frank? I was Rainbow fucking Randolph! That’s why!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Are you through?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: What? You’re in a hurry? You don’t have
time for me? The guy who earned for you? The guy who put those fucking
suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: I think it’s fair to say we helped each
other.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You gotta fix it, Frank. You gotta get me
my slot back.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: How can I sit around while that
rhinoceros… that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? You
and I have history, Frank! Please!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: There’s nothing I can do for you. Nothing.
You’re a pariah. I can’t even be seen with you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Don’t do this to me, Frank. I’m in deep,
deep shit. They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse… I got bookies
breathing down my neck. I’m homeless! Don’t you hear what I’m saying?
I’m not gonna make it! The clock’s ticking! Put yourself in my shoes,
for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: The ugly truth is, your shoes have become my
shoes. As long as the rhino’s on the air, everything’s by the book. No
skim, no percentage. Nothing. The network wanted squeaky clean and they
got it. And believe me, Mopes is sparkling.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: You’re totally broke? You don’t have a dime
left to your name?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Yes! Exactly! That’s what I’m trying to
tell you!</p>
<p><strong>stoke</strong>: Don’t contact me again, Randy. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You’ll get yours, Frank! The rhino too! Do
you hear me?! The wheels are turning!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sooner or later, even a guy who’s squeaky
clean falls into mud.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Again, these are just prototypes. I’ve been
assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Okay, so let’s recap before we break up… Yes
to the Smoochy ice pops. No to the Smoochy string cheese. And we’re in a
dick-measuring contest with Brown &amp; Brown over the shampoo
split.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Okay, time out, people! If I may interject,
I think we’re putting the cart before the horse here…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Smoochy’s still earning the trust of the
kids. We don’t want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and
cheese. How ’bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible.
Huh? Without all the bells and whistles and rickata-rackita. What do you
say, guys?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, damn.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: No problem, I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Shut the door please, John.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Now lock it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hey, Nora, wait up.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Good meeting today. I thought we tackled
some hot issues. Although, I’ll be honest, there were a few times that I
felt my voice wasn’t being heard.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I think that’s a conservative estimate.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I just want the show to have some weight,
you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure – but with a message. Pop
quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Do you sense my complete lack of interest?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Try two thousand. Covering every topic from
how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don’t you
get it, Nora? I’m a valuable resource. Use me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Can I make this real easy for you?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The only reason you’re on TV right now is
because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag. I didn’t discover you,
I delivered you. Like a bag of groceries. I have a bigger emotional
investment in my nail polish. So don’t peddle your sap to me, rhino.
Your job is just to smile and nod your head.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: … No, no, you misunderstand me. It’s not
that I’m literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ. I’m just
saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in.
Those guys didn’t care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It
was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s okay, my good man. Three’s my
limit.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I never saw anyone get loaded on orange
juice before.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Back in my college days I could put away a
carton of the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Gimme a Five Crown.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Smoochy the Rhino. Wow. I’m a big fan.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Gee, thanks. I usually don’t get recognized
without my horn.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Burke Bennett. I represent kid show
talent.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain’t in the
business to make you rich. He’s in it to make Frank Stokes rich. That’s
how these network goons operate.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s so sad. Is it just me, or is that
sad?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky
Gimble, was having a problem…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yeah, before the asshole found religion.
Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising
points. Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren’t
moving. Now Frank and I are old friends, so I say to him, ‘Okay, cock,
show me the warehouse’ – see, I know the fucking warehouse is in the
Bronx, and I know it’s emptier than my wife’s head. To make a long story
short, I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting
there with his thumb up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s very amusing, but I don’t care about
Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax… I just want more creative input.
This rhino came from my womb. I bore him, I nursed him, and dammit…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I should be the one who raises him!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Shel, it’s all about the dough. After you get
the money, you get the power. And after you get the power, you can have
Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: It’s funny, that never crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Unfortunately, until then… you’re just
another puppet in the prop room.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Give me a call when you’re ready, kid. I’ll
cut the strings and open the magic door for you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I saw you! I saw you in there… at my
table… talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yeah, so what do you want? A parade?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You’re my agent! Or did you forget
that?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Not anymore, pal. You’re a cigarette butt. Go
lay in the gutter.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Ah! They’re beautiful! A perfect batch of
cock cookies for a very special rhino.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Oh yes, you’re going to learn about shame,
my dear Smoochy. And I’m your professor.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Excuse me, Nora. Why was the ‘Please and
Thank You Song’ cut?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Because it’s sappy and it takes away from the
‘Cookie Song.’</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Takes away? It enhances it! The cookie song
is a meaningless piece of fluff without the ‘Please and Thank You’ coda!
That’s the moral anchor! That’s where the lesson is! You can’t sell the
sizzle without the steak!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s cut. And I want the ‘Cookie Song’ lyrics
changed back to the way they were originally scripted.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I can’t do that. I will not condone
children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. I have to look
myself in the mirror every morning.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: This is network television, not a sprout farm.
We’re here to sell sugar and plastic. That’s what keeps the lights
on.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You’re treating me like a puppet. You know
that? Well, guess what? I am not your puppet.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Since when? Now get your spongy orange ass out
there and dance for the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: We have different eyes, Nora. When I go out
there I see kids. You see wallets with pigtails.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Bon soir, la Smoochy. Welcome to fatty
Arbuckle-land.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Don’t worry, little ones. Rainbow Randolph
will return… After these messages!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Boy, all that jiggyin’ and ziggyin’ sure
makes a fella hungry! Now if only I had my super duper, super secret,
super special…</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Magic Cookie Bag!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Right-o-riffic! Magic Cookie Bag, I command
thee! Come to your lord and master!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: ‘Lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the
cookies! Fresh and organic, no need to panic! Right from the soil, no
tropical oils! Sweetened with juice, for an energy boost! Fiber galore,
you’ll be askin’ for more…’</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Oooh… just the smell of unprocessed flour
makes my tummy do somersaults!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Whatever that means, you fucking
retard.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Give ’em a cookie… give ’em a cookie…</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Wow! Look at this cookie, kids! A rocket
ship!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What a special day with such special
cookies!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I’m flying to
the moon! I’m flying to Mars! I’m flying to –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Are you fucking blind?! It’s a cock! Not a
space ship! Cock! Cock!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thank you all for coming. I just wanted to
iron out a few wrinkles I feel we’re having in the communication
department. No finger-pointing. Lord knows when you start pointing
fingers, someone gets poked in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Anyhoo, I’d like to turn the floor over to
my new agent, Mr. Burke Bennett. So… heeeeeere’s Burke!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: As you can imagine, my client has many
concerns, not the least of which is studio security, but we can address
that later.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: See this guy, Frank? Take a good long look,
’cause this prick saved your life. Without him you’d be sitting in
Kaplan’s right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw. And, you –
you’d be organizing puppet shows for the brats at P.S. 86. Excuse me,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: There’s no excuse for you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Man, I love club soda.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: We’ve always managed to come to some sort of
arrangement, Burke. Why the fireworks?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: ’Cause I’m holding all the gunpowder. I
represent the man who created, owns, and controls every square inch of
Smoochy the Rhino.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: God created Adam and what did he get? A
fucking dud. My guy? He breathed life into a winner. And anyone who does
a better job than God is gonna have a price.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Burke, of course, is in no way comparing me
to God.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You seem to forget that we went out and found
‘your guy.’ Dug up his corpse. Handed him his own show when he couldn’t
sell his face to a photo booth.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: To be fair, Nora, I was booked to open a
car wash in Montauk.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Oh, so you were doing him a favor? Allow me
to untangle this web of shit! I don’t care what his resume was, I don’t
care where you found him, I don’t care if his last job was juggling
apples for a hut full of Pygmies on the outskirts of the Congo… the fact
is, he fits a bill and you need him. Like a hungry baby needs a big tit.
And that, my friends, is why you’re in a box with no ventilation. And
that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: What is that, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Heaven, hell, and everything in between.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: To the star and new executive producer of the
Smoochy show! May your reign be a long and healthy one!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m still in shock. Complete creative
control, part ownership of the show, discretion over merchandising and a
dressing room with a toilet! Am I dreaming or what?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: And don’t forget the corporate penthouse. It
took me six years to get that for Randolph.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Boy, imagine… me, living in a penthouse.
Who’d a thunk it.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s called the high life, kid. Get used to
it. Pretty soon you’ll be burnin’ one hundred dollar bills just to see
Franklin break a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep respect for
money. Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some remarkable achievements
in his lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: That’s your graduation present. Something
you’re gonna need now.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Think of it as a tool of the trade.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’ve never owned a gun, I’ve never touched
a gun, and I don’t believe in guns. When I played cowboys and Indians as
a kid, I was always the Chinese railroad worker.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Trust me, Shel. It’s a handy accessory in
this business. Even if you don’t load it, have it for show. Sometimes
that’s all you need. Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking
around.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Hiya, Smoochy! I’m Spinner! Spinner!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I’m so excited to meet you! I’m
Spinner!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Oh… right. I saw you fight on TV once. I
think it was your farewell bout.</p>
<p><strong>ringside commentator #1</strong>: Tonight marks Spinner
Dunn’s final appearance in the ring. What a pleasure it’s been to watch
him proudly march into the record books for taking more blows to the
head than any fighter in history.</p>
<p><strong>ringside commentator #2</strong>: Scrambled a bit? Sure. You
don’t retire with a record of 81-59 and wind up the Governor. But on the
upside, he’s got the disposition of a collie.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: You know what I love, Smoochy? I love when
you do the Jiggy Ziggy dance! You know, the one you do during ‘Silly
Time?’</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You bet. That’s a big one.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Wanna see me do it?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, I don’t know why if there’s enough
room here to…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Okay, champ, don’t get overheated.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I… uh… love you, too, Spinner.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Spinner, come over and meet the Senator!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: He seems pretty popular. It must take real
talent to run a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Spinner? The guy couldn’t run a water faucet.
He’s just a mascot. It’s his cousins, a bunch of Irish mob boys, who
really run the joint.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Don’t go anywhere, Smoochy! I’ll be right
back after I take a dump!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I think you made a new friend, kid.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Yeah, who is it?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Open up, buddy! It’s me, Randolph! It’s
been a long time!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Randy?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You fucking traitor! My body’s barely cold
and already you work for the rhino?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Don’t lie to me! I heard all about it! You
strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: I gotta eat, don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You’re a Krinkle Kid! Not a Smooch-bag!
Say it!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Rhinette!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say it, before
God! On the soul of Jesus Christ! Say what you are!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: I’m a Rhinette. Got that? The Krinkle Kids
are ten feet under. With you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I missed you so much. Can I stay here? I
got no place to go.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: … They kicked me out of the corporate
penthouse. Big surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That’s how I got this
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: And of course, there’s this…</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: That happened after my little visit to the
studio the other day. Network security. Fucking savages.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I got liens, back taxes, lawyer’s bills,
threats against my life… I basically got the whole fucking world up my
ass. It’s okay, I got a loooong memory, son. What dey sow, dey gonna
reap.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Stop doing this to yourself!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Wise up! You hear me? Don’t piss your life
away like this.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: It’s the rhino, Angie. He’s been sent by
the devil. Sent from hell to destroy me. Smoochy… is the face of
evil.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Whenever you get a chance… I just need a
second.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Listen, can I call you back? Yeah, some
asshole’s screaming in my ear. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m sorry, you didn’t have to hang up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If I didn’t you’d still be here.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: But I am still here.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m hoping to correct that.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Nora, I want us to start off on the right
foot. I want you to know that I value your input and I don’t want you to
feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit. I
consider you a partner.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Great. That’ll come in handy if we’re ever at
a square dance.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, I was never much of the do- se-do
type, but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day. You
know, just two colleagues chewing the fat… forming a mutual respect…
planting the seeds of cooperation…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Fair enough. If you change your mind –</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Okay then, I’ll be in my office if you need
me. If you want to brainstorm about anything. Ideas and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Ficus?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: My cousin Spinner’s take quite a shine to
you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ever since you came in the restaurant. He
can’t stop yakkin’.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, he’s a very nice man. Very sweet
disposition for someone that size.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So, I was wondering if maybe you could give
him a little floor space.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know, a little part on the show. You’re
the executive producer now. You call the shots, right?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Uh, that’s a very sweet offer, and I love
Spinner, but TV is a complicated medium and… I mean, that would be like
me getting into the ring with a prizefighter. Can you imagine such a
thing? Boom. K.O.! What’s the alphabet, Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This makes me sad. Very, very, sad.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s wrong, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nothing. I’m just very sad right now.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Who made you sad, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t want to mention names.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You know what? Maybe I can find Spinner a
little something to do on the show. That’s probably the best
solution.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re a good boy, Mopes. Don’t think we
don’t remember favors.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Look, I appreciate the visit, but I’m just
putting together a little petting zoo segment. Nothing fancy – a few
kittens… maybe a duck…</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: If you’re looking to bring in that many
pieces I gotta put a crew together. Plus, we’re lookin’ at transpo, a
few leash handlers, a cleanup boy and a doper to keep the inventory
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Jeez, this all sounds awfully elaborate. I
might have to forgo the union and just borrow a few animals from a pet
shop.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I wouldn’t recommend it. Miss Carol from
Romper Room tried that once and she’s still limping.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: On behalf of FunZone Toys, I’d like to
congratulate you on your recent promotion, and present you with a small
gift.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Uh… that’s nice of you, Ben, but a card
would have been fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy
contract, Mr. Mopes.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Is this… I mean… are you offering me a
bribe or something?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy
contract, Mr. Mopes.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Normally, sir, we take the trash out at the
end of the day, but I think I’ll make an exception in your case.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: He says he’s an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You better grow eyes on the back of your
fucking head, you horned piece of shit! I won’t sleep until the worms
are crawlin’ up your foam rubber ass! I’m going on safari, motherfucker…
safari!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Congratulations on your little ice show.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It didn’t take you long to sell out, did
it?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What happened to your precious integrity? Or
was that just part of your dog and pony act.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Burke, I never agreed to do an ice
show.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Shel, do you know what kind of cash we’ll
take in between the gate and concessions? A venture like this gets you
money and muscle. Times twenty.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Ice shows represent everything I’m against.
They’re mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced
sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid’s mouth on the
ride home.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, I know you got this fetish for ethics,
but now’s not the time to fly that kite. No one’s ever refused a shot at
an ice show.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Until now. Smoochy doesn’t sell out, Burke.
You should be proud of that. Proud that you represent a client who paves
driveways, not paints them over.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I’m thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’ll have a pineapple juice, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Pineapple? What happened to orange juice?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m feeling feisty tonight.</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Boy, wasn’t that fun? In an awkward kind of
way? Anyhoo, how ’bout a big round of applause for the newest member of
the Smoochyland Band… former heavyweight contender, Spinner Dunn!</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Shit. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Did I do good, Sheldon, huh? Did I do
good?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yeah, that was great, Spinner. Just watch
your elbow next time. Pinky’s probably gonna lose that tooth.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Okey doke. I’m gonna go get drunk now.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nice job. Casting the show with mental
patients, I like that.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: He is not a mental patient. He’s an
ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent
brian of a five-year-old!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Excuse me for not making the distinction.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thanks anyway, but I’m going uptown.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Humor me, rhino.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Merv Green, Sheldon. It’s a pleasure to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: If you’re hoping for an autograph, the
gun’s a bit much. The whole ‘catch more flies with honey’ thing – it
really holds water.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Sheldon, I represent the Parade of Hope
Foundation. Maybe you’ve heard of us.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You raise money to build children’s
hospitals, right?</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: We’ve been known to add a brick or two,
sure.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Sheldon, let me get right to the point –
there’s talk on the street that you’re pulling out of the ice show. Is
that true?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You know, I never agreed to an ice show,
nor would I ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of
this is your concern, sir. Sheesh.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Listen carefully, son: Parade of Hope has
sponsored every Kidnet ice show since 1964. We take a piece off the top
and everybody walks away happy. So let’s not buck history.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, I appreciate the offer, but for the
gazillionth time, I’m not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to
discuss. Now, if you’ll just pull over, I’ll get out and we’ll say our
toodley-dos. Far corner, please.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Allow me to be less murky. Starting tomorrow,
Smoochy the Rhino raises his baton for Parade of Hope. Benefits,
banquets, fund-raisers, I want it all. Pull over, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: And as far as the ice show goes… I recommend
you start shopping for skates.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: This is unacceptable, Burke! I’m calling
the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Don’t do it, Shel. You rat on Parade of Hope
and you’ll be lucky if they find your toenails. These guys are the
roughest of all the charities.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I was threatened by an organization that’s
supposed to help children! What kind of world is this?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: The real one. My advice? Consider the ice
show and stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Uh… are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m getting drunk and I’m not used to it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Oh. Well, not to make you feel worse, but
with alcohol you’re also consuming empty calories.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s just that… I want to apologize, actually.
And on those rare occasions when I feel the need to apologize for
something, it helps if I’m, you know… shit- faced.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Wow. I’m honored.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Why don’t we get some air?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I… I may have been a little harsh when we
spoke the other day. A little out of line.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, it wasn’t as bad as the week before
when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes, that was probably insensitive as well. I
heard you’re not doing the ice show. I find that… incredibly admirable.
Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I guess I didn’t want to spoil your fun.
You look so content when you’re berating me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m afraid I have become a bit hardened over
the years. Sincerity’s an easy disguise in this business. It’s hard to
know who’s on the level.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Believe me, I’m learning that more and more
every day. ‘Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing
like Sometimes Winter feels like Don’t think you know everything.’</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: ‘Rickets the Hippo’?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You remember Rickets?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That was my favorite show when I was a kid.
Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s how I felt! Rickets had real depth.
He was my inspiration for Smoochy.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Really? He was my inspiration to work in
children’s television.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I can’t believe it. I never met anyone who
even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Remember it? I did it at my first
communion.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m sorry. That was a mistake, right? I
didn’t mean for that to hap–</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re not full of shit like all the others,
are you?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re for real, right?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I mean, I couldn’t tell… First I thought it
was an act… and then I just thought you were a simp or something…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Shhh… you don’t have to explain…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What’s wrong? Is it the whiskey? If you
have to throw up, be my guest. Anywhere you like.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s just getting late.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Better get that. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is Benjamin
Kunklepeck and I’m calling on behalf of ‘Parents for Decency in
Children’s Television,’ perhaps you’ve heard of us?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: No, but I like where you’re coming from.
It’s an issue very close to my heart. Why just yesterday I was
commenting –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sir, we’re having a banquet tomorrow and
we’d be honored to have you perform for us. We would also like to
present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to children’s
television. The presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma. Can
you attend?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thanks for picking me up, Mr. Kunklepeck.
It’s very nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Don’t be silly. The chance to have Smoochy
the Rhino perform at our little soiree? I’d carry you piggy-back through
a bed of hot rusty glass if I had to.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, it’s always a pleasure to help out a
worthy cause. And believe me, I’ve learned lately that it’s not all
sunshine and daffodils in the land of non- profit.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I just looove your show, by the way. It’s
such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler… what’s
his name again? Rainbow something or other?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Randolph.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a scoundrel!
He’s probably gay too.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I feel sorry for him,
actually. He obviously has problems or issues that he needs to sort
out.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don’t you take
particular glee in that you basically stole his time slot? Helped shovel
dirt onto his miserable corpse, as it were?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: No, I would never take pleasure in
someone’s downfall. You know the old expression about walking a mile in
another man’s shoes? Well, that really holds water. Just try to imagine
–</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Come on, he’s a fucking asshole! You hate
him! Admit it!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Uh… can we listen to the radio?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Okay, they’re ready for you!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I gotta say, this is a first – I never
performed in a tractor parts warehouse before.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Well, we like to do these things
no-frills. It’s all about the kids.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Amen to that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It gives me great pleasure to introduce our
very special guest… a supporter of the cause and a friend to the
brotherhood. Please welcome, the one, the only… Smoochy the Rhino!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Knock ’em dead, kid!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: ‘Well, how-do-you-do, my good friends! How
do-you-do, my pals! It’s so nice to see good friends! Sing along with me
now! How do you do, my good –’</p>
<p><strong>nazis</strong>: Heil Smoochy! Heil Smoochy! Heil Smoochy!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: It’s my sincere hope that I’m dreaming
right now, but in the event that I’m not… what’s the deal with the
swastikas?</p>
<p><strong>lead cop</strong>: This is an unlawful assembly, you kraut
sons-a-bitches! You’re all under arrest!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Are you officially a member of the
Aryan Brotherhood, Sheldon?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Is it true you consider Adolph Hitler
your personal hero?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Do you think associating with neo-
Nazis might adversely affect your career?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: How does it feel to be a hate- filled
racist scumbag?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: This is a mix-up! I’m innocent! I don’t
hate anyone!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: Does that mean you don’t hate
Nazis?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Wait! I didn’t say that! I –</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Here at Kidnet, Smoochy the Rhino is now
Smoochy the Ghost. We have excised that particular malignancy from our
network and will seek out a suitable replacement.</p>
<p><strong>ceo</strong>: Until then, the Smoochy slot will be safely
occupied by Popeye cartoons. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Hi there, poochy!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Well, aren’t you the cutest little boo-boo
in the world!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: For you, my dear! May you live to be a
hundred!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: We have nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Don’t tell me you believe what they’re
saying!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t have to believe anyone. The picture in
the paper said it all. No one forced you to perform at that rally.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Perform? I barely sang one song.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well maybe next time you’ll do a longer
set.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Nora, I had no idea that was a Nazi
function. None whatsoever!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Funny, you’d think the fifty-foot swastika you
were standing in front of might’ve given you a hint.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: The papers are blowing that out of
proportion. It was nowhere near that big.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Look, the fact of the matter is, I don’t know
you, okay? Not really. So don’t expect me to go out on an emotional limb
here.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: But what about the balcony? What about the
Klunky-Wunky dance?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I was drunk. Don’t read too much into it.</p>
<p><strong>old vagrant</strong>: If you’re lookin’ to get a cup of
juice, the well’s dried up, son. City shut her down. Bastards’ll put a
new pair of tits on the Statue of Liberty, but they won’t help a poor
hophead.</p>
<p><strong>old vagrant</strong>: Just once I wish I had a little clout.
You know? I’d set things straight in this town, believe me. Hell of a
world.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hell of a world.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: ‘Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters’
is the hottest show on Japanese television. The sweat shops are working
overtime trying to keep up with the demand. Record albums, toys, cereal,
tee shirts, you name it…</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Look, Stokes, let’s cut the bullshit. We want
Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we’re willing to do whatever it takes
to get it.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Pardon me for saying this, but for a
non-resident of this country, you speak impeccable English.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I’m originally from Teaneck.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: We own every hair on this bastard’s head and
we’re willing to share a few strands… if you get my drift.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Well, it’s not that simple. I have an
executive board to answer to. I wish I could just snap my fingers and
make a deal but –</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You mean like this?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Oh my. And what is this on my desk?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle
bag. Get our boy the slot and we’ll round it off to a million. And you
can keep the luggage.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You’re dealing with an honorable culture,
Frank. We know how to play ball.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Gentlemen, I suddenly feel invigorated and
full of hope.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Hiya, cutie!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: So here’s the good news: Yes, I’ll be
happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and
Frank are in a bind, so I’ll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props,
tell ‘em the R man is back and he’s ready to start whistlin’ dem happy
tunes for da little chillens.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch
around here?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’ve got three seconds to pry your ass off
my couch and get out.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Dammit, Nora! The rhino’s gone! You need
that slot filled and I’m ready to reclaim what’s rightfully mine.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Just in case you forgot, you’re a criminal and
a scumbag.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray
shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that’s like
jerking off in the supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Where do you shop?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Come on. Have you lost all affection for
me? After what we once had?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That was a long time ago. I was young and
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Why we broke up I’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You turned into an asshole and I didn’t love
you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: We could’ve worked through all that.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Damn it, Nora! The public is clamoring for
me! I’m a fucking patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He’s evil! He’s probably
even gay! You should’ve seen the way he was checking me out in the
car!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: What does what mean?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You said he was checking you out in the car.
What car?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: No… it’s just a vibe! A Nazi homosexual
vibe! It emanates from the television! The whole Smoochy costume… with
the erect horn… I mean, what’s that all about?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re talking awfully fast, Randolph.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I still love you! Let’s go on a date!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Were you at that rally? Tell me! Did you have
something to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Did you set Sheldon up?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You know, now I remember why we broke up.
Always with the accusations. Bitch, bitch, bitch…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s wrong, kid? The mayor of Patterson’s
here with his wife. They wanna meet ya.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I don’t wanna meet no one. I miss Smoochy!
He never woulda done the things they say he done. He ain’t no Nazi.
Someone’s making stuff up. I just know it, Tommy. Someone’s making stuff
up!</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I want Smoochy back! I want to be on TV
again! I want to play my cowbell!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner. Has Burke been in
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Something I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I have to talk to him. It’s about Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Sheldon? What about Sheldon?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’m trying to sleep, asshole! Read the
fucking meter some other time!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You wanna tell me about the rhino?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Hey, this is private property, creep! And
you’re trespassing!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little back
rub.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: How does it feel to be voted the most
hated man in America, Randolph?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: In a country like this, where your average
citizen is a fuckin’ Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of honor.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: What about Ms. Bishop’s charge that you
have an unhealthy obsession with Sheldon Mopes?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Listen, I barely know that broad. She’s a
wacko. An opportunist. I’m the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: That was unfair! Who threw that? That was
mean and uncalled for!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: My client is not answering any more
questions. Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he’s
sinking into a deep psychotic depression. Please stop antagonizing him.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I wouldn’t be back here if it wasn’t for
you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m just sorry I didn’t believe you… that I
got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, this town’s a house of mirrors
sometimes. It’s hard to know what you’re looking at.</p>
<p><strong>stagehand</strong>: They’re ready for you, Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen… boys and girls…
Who’s your favorite rhino?</p>
<p><strong>kids in bleachers</strong>: Smoochy!!!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Thank you. It’s good to be back. You know,
kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair. A place where nice
guys don’t just finish last… they get their heads cut off.</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: That pretty world you think you know is
just props and scenery. Lollipop trees with roots in venom!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: So look around you, boys and girls. Every
day. Be diligent! Stand strong! As the old proverb says: Beat a dog one
time too many and you get a wolf! Let’s start howling! Howl for me, boys
and girls!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Okay, I just wanted to get that off my
chest. Who wants to do the Hokey-Pokey?!</p>
<p><strong>tara</strong>: Well, Smoochy’s back and boy did we miss him.
Hundreds of well- wishers stood outside Kidnet Studios today hoping to
catch a glimpse of their favorite rhino.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: That’s right, Tara. Smoochy’s popularity is
stronger than ever thanks to his recent exoneration as a Nazi
sympathizer. In fact, several movie studios are offering big bucks for a
chance to bring the Smoochy story to the silver screen…</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Bad… very bad… too much for brain…
pressure building… ears ringing… eyes burning… contempt overflowing…</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I hate you! I fucking hate you!!! You
devil-horned mind fucker! Die, die, die!!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: What are you doing?! That’s a Zenith! Look
at this place!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: That’s it! I want you out of here!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Where am I supposed to go?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: I don’t care! Out!!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I missed you so much!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I missed you too, champ.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I’ve been practicing and practicing and I
got real good, Sheldon. Real good!</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Wanna see me march?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: So you were saying you had some good
news?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yes. Some very good news. After giving it a
lot of thought… I’ve decided to do the ice show.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah boy. Today
you are a man!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I realize now it’s a sin to waste your
power.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Like they say, rock bottom’s a college
education.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: But here’s the really good news: I’m doing
it myself. No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks. Not one dirty hand will
touch this. Not one person will make a dollar off these kids. Smoochy on
Ice will be a study in purity.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: As far as food concessions go, I’ll supply
the refreshments. For free. Low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple
slices. Healthy stuff. Now are you ready for the best part?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I’m holding my breath.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: All profits from ticket sales will be used
to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m not just talking a run-of-the- mill
clinic… I’m going to build a methadone palace. A place where men and
women can withdraw in luxury.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Sheldon, you can’t do an ice show and cut out
the vendors. And more importantly, you can’t cut out the Parade of Hope.
It’s suicide.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You always told me, when you’ve got muscles
you make the rules. Well, I’m feeling pretty strong right now.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: All this time I was letting the business
use me. Well, I think it’s time I start using the business. I’ve got my
clout back and I’m not gonna waste it this time. Take care of it,
Burke.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shel, you gotta help me out. He bangs that
goddamn thing from morning till night. I got a headache that goes from
my eyes to my ass.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say it. You
know I love Spinner. And I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Give the boy something else to do on the
show. Anything. Just as long as it don’t clang, chime or honk.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I don’t like complications, Frank. You got
one week to get Takashi that slot or you’re gonna be shakin’ hands with
Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Don’t you understand? My hands are tied. The
rhino’s been exonerated. The show’s more popular than ever.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him and dump him
in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: All right! I’ll take care of it! I just need
time!</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or I get a
blender and make an Orange Julius with your feet.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Save the rhino! Before it’s too late! Make a
donation! Save the rhino! Hey, mister, ya wanna help save the rhino?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’m the one who needs to be saved! Me. I’m
broke! I lost my lawyer! My only friend kicked me out! I’m a fucking
peanut shell in the shape of a man! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!
Save the Rainbow!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Help! Someone call a cop!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Your client is suffocating me. To make
matters worse, he’s caused me to veer into a hazardous situation. A
situation that otherwise could have a very happy ending.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Tell me more about the Asians.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: They’re ruthless. Unwavering. Unprincipled.
And best of all, they know how the game is played. They respect our
delicate ecosystem of mutual benefit.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: I’d bring you in on this, Burke. You’d be my
partner on the Takashi deal. Split down the middle. We have an
opportunity to get back on track here. Back to the way it was.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: The good old days.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Pre-rhinoceros.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: This is very sticky ground we’re about to
walk on.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Well, you’re used to a little glue on your
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Let me poke around. Sift through the
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: This is what happens to guys who keep secrets,
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ll give you the rest next week! I
promise!</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: It’s not me you’re fucking over, it’s sick
kids. You got something against sick kids, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No! I love sick kids!</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: And you tell that fat producer of yours, if he
ever gives me a low head count again, he’ll lose the other thumb.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Merv Green. How’s tricks, kid?</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Well, if it ain’t smilin’ Burke. Whose bones
are you pickin’ today?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You got a minute, pally?</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: No one freezes me out of an ice show. No one.
I don’t care how many fucking clinics he’s trying to save.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, I’m chokin’ on the same bone as
you.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: If you’re trying to aggravate me, you’re doing
a hell of a job.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I’m not here to aggravate, just educate. I
think Mopes might be talking to people he shouldn’t be talking to.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: That’s an ugly string of words.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: He’s got it in his head that he’s gonna clean
up the way we do business. Truthfully? I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s
wearing a wire.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Jesus, I got a thing across town.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Let’s keep talking, Merv. There’s oughta be
some kind of solution. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Attention, New Yorkers! You are about to
hear a shocking story of injustice!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I urge you to listen! It has a surprise
ending you won’t want to miss!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: It’s the story of a venomous rhino and his
aggressive campaign to slander, vilify, defame, denigrate and villainize
my good name! But one thing he can’t do, is take my life from me. No,
friends, only I have the power to do that!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: This is what Smoochy has done to me! He’s
brought me to this! I can no longer live in a world where the innocent
suffer and the wicked thrive!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Where is God??!!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’m sorry to do this, people. Don’t try to
talk me out of it.</p>
<p><strong>man in crowd</strong>: Do it! Light it!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Our guest of honor will be here any
moment! This is for his eyes! For his conscience. He’ll have to live
with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Take it from me, Lester. Use your power.
Don’t squander it – build with it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I ever get any
power I’ll give that a whirl. Hey, what’s going on up there?</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Looks like a street performer of some
sort.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: This is it, folks! It’s showtime! I’m
sorry to do this, but he’s left me no choice!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Shut up, you hillbilly assholes! You’re
borough trash! Go back to your huts across the river!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I was the
last of the Mohicans! You’ll never see another Rainbow Randolph in this
lifetime! You had me and you blew it! All of you!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: This if for you, Smoochy! Remember this!
As long as you live, remember this image! You did this to me!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Whatcha doin’, Rainbow Randolph?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Smoochy!!!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: What does it all mean??!!</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: What do you mean I can’t play the cowbell
no more?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You’re too talented for the cowbell,
Spinner. Cowbells are for babies.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: I ain’t no baby!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s right. You’re a fully grown man.
With whiskers… and scars… the whole sha-bang. That’s why you deserve a
bigger role on the show. A more important role…</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: ‘Stepdads are people too/ They have bad days,
like we all do/ Be patient and help them through/ Stepdads are people
too…’</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: … ‘So three cheers for the man that I
proudly call Stan… He’s not quite a dad or a brother… Yes, he gets
cross, but still he’s the boss… And besides he takes care of my
mother!’</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Remember, kids. First impressions, good or
bad, are not always what they seem. Just like a new puppy, new dads need
to adjust to their surroundings. So give ’em time! But always remember…
if he becomes abusive to you or Mommy… what are the magic numbers?</p>
<p><strong>kids in bleachers</strong>: Nine-One-One!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Right-o-riffic!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: And now, boys and girls, I have a special
surprise. I’d like to introduce the newest member of the Magic Jungle…
my cousin… Moochy the Rhino!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the Jungle! You
wanna say howdy to the kids?</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: Moochy?</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: My name is Moochy.</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: That’s right. We’ve established that.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Sheldon, this costume’s makin’ my nuts
itch.</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: That was fun! Was it bad when I done that
thing, where I tripped and knocked over the Flamingo and then he knocked
over the cameraman and then those lights fell down on that lady’s
head?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: It’s fine, Spinner. We’ll edit it out. But
tomorrow in rehearsal we’re gonna work on a new thing called ‘the
importance of hitting your mark.’</p>
<p><strong>spinner</strong>: Great! I get to hit something!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I read about the ice show.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering
it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I think it’s great. What you’re doing for that
clinic.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I just need some clarification…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Don’t worry. Spinner just needs a little
more rehearsal. I’ll get him there.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No I mean about us.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Ever since you’ve been back I just feel like
there’s something that’s not connecting.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I guess I’m still readjusting a little.
Like a guy who’s come back from the war. Not that I’d equate my
misfortune with the</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I just thought we were on our way to
something… granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis
might have put a damper on our relationship, but I’m sorry for –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey – rhino.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Former heavyweight contender and
restaurateur Lawrence ‘Spinner’ Dunn was found shot to death in a
rhinoceros outfit early this morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a frequent
performer on ‘Smoochy’s Magic Jungle,’ was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police are searching for –</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: How could you hit the wrong rhino?!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who knew Smoochy had a cousin Moochy? They
look fucking identical.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy is burnt
rust! Read the papers! Do I gotta take you back to fucking
kindergarten?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: All you said was ‘hit the rhino.’ You never
specified the color. I’m not taking the blame for this one.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: I’m not through with you yet, rhino! Your time
will fucking come!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: It’s my fault. He’d still be alive if it
wasn’t for me. He would have been so proud to be in the ice show.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: There was nothing you could have done. Don’t
torture yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m sorry, Spinner. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He really loved you, Shel. And this I
guarantee – that fucking Randolph has seen his last rainbow. We’re gonna
find him, cut off his balls, and shove ’em up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Maybe you better leave it to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They won’t do the ball thing. It’s against
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t forget – that hit was meant for you,
Shel. So from now on, everywhere you go, we go.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: That’s okay, Tommy. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fine, nothin’. And as Christ is my witness,
no one’s touchin’ a hair on your fuckin’ head. Spinner would have wanted
it that way.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Alright, boys, let’s get shit- faced. For
Spin.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Didn’t Rickets the Hippo have a song about
death?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: ‘The Last Nappy Time.’ It gave me a lot of
comfort when my mother died. ‘When doggies stop barking And fish cease
to swim And Grandpa lays silent, from his Sadness will find you But soon
you’ll feel fine…’</p>
<p><strong>sheldon/nora</strong>: ‘In life we all have Our Last Nappy
Time.’</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I didn’t do it! I know you’re still mad at
me, but you gotta believe me.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: The papers say you were the mastermind.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Mastermind? I can barely figure out how to
unzip my pants these days. Just taking a piss is a logistical
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: I believe you, Randy. But you can’t come
back to my place. They’ll find you. You gotta go underground.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: It’s heatin’ up out there. Every cop in New
York is looking for you. And Tommy Cotter’s boys are combin’ the
streets. You’re gonna have to stay put for a while.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I was an altar boy once. Did you know
that? I wanted to be a priest. Do you believe in angels, Angie?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Angels?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: There was a little angel in pigtails. She
was the only one who cared about me. She saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: You didn’t want to kill yourself, Randy. You
know that.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Perhaps it’s time to heal. To accept the
fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward. True, I’m
currently wanted for a murder I didn’t commit. But I have faith. Faith
that justice will prevail.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Now you’re talkin’, kid. This is a big step…
I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Did you bring lunch?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Chicken and stars?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Just like you asked for.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Can I have some, please?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: For a smile.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Atta boy.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Here, I got you some crossword puzzles and
stuff to read.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: You okay? Randy?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Motherfucker!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Big news, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It wasn’t Smiley who killed Spinner. It was
Parade of Hope.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Merv Green?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Are you sure? The cops have tons of
evidence on Randolph.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We did our own investigation. Cousin Ian from
down at the morgue… you met him at the wake…</p>
<p><strong>ian</strong>: See the neck? Snapped like a twig. Animals…
Parade of Hope’s calling card. When they do a guy, they like to sign the
tab.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s that guy’s name over there? Green?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah, Merv Green.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This was one time they shoulda left the tab
blank.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I knew Merv Green was a scumbag from the day
he grabbed my ass at a ‘Feed the Children’ benefit.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, God help those guys now. They’re
gonna get a first-class ride through the criminal justice system, and
I’m buying the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s all taken care of, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: It was a mistake! An honest mistake! All I’m
trying to do is help children.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You like kids, huh?</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Yes! Of course!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So you must know a few fairy tales. Danny,
tell him the one about the worthless prick who gets his head chopped
off.</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: No… no… no!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Now you know why charities go under
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Do we really need to hear this? I don’t
want to hear this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A clean cut.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Okay, got it.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: And then we took his head and –</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Thank you! Specifics about his head are
superfluous at this point.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Can I help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Yeah, honey, you can help us with
something…</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You tell that boss of yours he better take
care of the rhino problem. In my culture we honor deals or invite
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about and
your cologne’s making me nauseous. Other than that, you’re great
company.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Spicy little thing, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Takashi gets that time slot. You hear me,
girly? Tell that boss of yours we’ll kill everyone at this fucking
network if we have to. Starting with the pretty ones.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Auf Wiedersehen, honey.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s Stokes. He’s behind the whole thing! He
cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He wants you out so he can put Takashi in!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Who’s Takashi?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Jesus, Sheldon! Don’t you ever pick up a copy
of International Performer? He’s the hottest kid show host from
Asia.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs in a
little bonfire. All we need is a few sticks and some wienies.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I had her before you! Pachyderm! I was in
love with her! In love! And you snatched her away! Like a common thief!
You’re the bad guy! Not me! He’s the bad guy, Nora. He’s incapable of
understanding the love we once had! Tender, yet passionate.
Old-fashioned, yet experimental. Tell him about a few of our
experiments, Nora! Tell him!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Is this true? Please tell me it’s just the
confused ramblings of a diseased mind.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Holy mother of Toledo. When exactly were
you planning to let me know about this?!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Listen, there was a time – and I’m not proud
of this – but there was a time when I was a bit of a… kiddie-host
groupie.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You’re just another action figure for her
collection!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Tell him about Jingle Jackson!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You dated Jingle Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The bells turned her on. Hey, tell him
about Jumbo Johnny! There’s a tale for ya! A whale of a tale!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Oh good Lord in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Look, what I did before I met you is none of
your business.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Shut up! Both of you! This is my show!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Do you fully understand the power of a
condemned man? Do you? I’m already wanted for one murder, why should I
give a flaming horse’s twat if I commit two more?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I… uh… read once that the best way to
diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you
like to hear a funny joke?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Oh, please. Go blow yourself, Martha. Fix
me a beverage, woman. Make me one of those drinks that used to make us
all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Fix it yourself, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m telling you, you’d love this joke. It
revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender
bender.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You know, when I lived here I used to have
a big painting above the fireplace. A naked chick holding a pumpkin. It
was very tasteful. No bush…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Look, Randolph. We know it wasn’t you who
killed Spinner.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: We’ll go to the police, first thing
tomorrow… straighten everything out.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Oh! Goody-goody gumdrops! Vodka straight
up is fine, sugar babe!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Did you put on a little weight, honey?
That’s okay, you’re still a hot little brood mare. I bet you miss the
sweet sting of my riding crop. Giddy up, pony!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: ’Rainbow Randolph is the man. Yes he, yes
he, is. He’s the Prez of Rainbowland. Yes he, yes he, is. With some fun,
fun here, and a Here a dance, there a song, Everything is fun, fun.
Rainbow Randolph is the King, the</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Is this what you want? A Hansel and Gretel
ending?! You want to be the big bad wolf?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Stop! It’s too hot! The heat! It’s driving
me mad!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off. My
life’s over anyway. Everything I touch turns to shit. Put me out of my
misery.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You’re not nothing. You’re bitter,
misguided and I’m guessing a raging alcoholic, but you’re still Rainbow
Randolph. Despite everything that’s happened, you once made children
happy.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Would you be my friend?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You too?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sorry about the brood mare stuff.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Just making the playing field even. I’m
tired of running this race with one leg.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re letting them drag you down to their
level.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: She’s right, Sheldon. Don’t make the same
mistakes I did. Keep your dignity intact.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I appreciate everyone’s concern, but I can
take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I tried.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Okay, buddy, we have to get down to the
Garden. You’re welcome to stay here as long as you like. Just don’t
leave until I get things squared away.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Be careful, Sheldon. Remember what I told
you – you’ve only scratched the surface of this scummy business. You
have yet to strike oil.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: You’re lucky to have a guy like
Smoochy.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You just rest, Randolph.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: He’s the real thing. Smoochy’s the real
thing. And I’ve been a fraud. A wicked man doing wicked acts.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Well, we all have our bad days.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Things are getting out of hand. We have to
cover our tracks.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Relax, everything’s gonna work out.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Relax? They found Merv Green’s head on the
Grand Concourse! Excuse my concern.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Look, we can cover all the tracks we want,
but in the end we still got the same problem. We gotta finish what we
started.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: God help us…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’ll all be over tonight. Buggy’s gonna take
care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy who hosted
‘Buggy’s Bumpy Railroad’?</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Yeah, until he discovered the joys of
Turkish black mule heroin. For the right price he’ll do anything. It’s
amazing the guy’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: I don’t know, Burke… this whole thing…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Speak of the devil. Have a seat, Bug.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Buggy. You’re looking good.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s time we put this thing to rest, Frank.
And the way I see it… the rhino’s up past his bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Hellooo!</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Randy, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie, shouldn’t
you be getting ready for the big show?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Listen, Buggy’s been here.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Buggy Double D’s? The Dong Man?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass and he’s
braggin’ that he’s doing some kind of job for Burke Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sheldon’s in trouble. I gotta get down to
the Garden.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: The place is crawling with cops. They’ll
jump on you like a trampoline.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I have to warn the rhino.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now… it gives us great pleasure to
introduce America’s favorite rhino… ladies and gentlemen… boys and
girls… Heeeeere’s Smoochy!</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: On behalf of myself, the Rhinettes, and the
soon to be restored Coney Island Methadone Center, I thank you all for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>smoochy</strong>: It was my original intention that tonight’s
performance would be a benign mix of Smoochy songs and ice dancing. But
as an artist, I believe I must convey to you, my fans, what I’m feeling
at any given moment in my life. To do otherwise would be dishonest. Art
is communication. It’s something we learn and hopefully grow from. With
that in mind… I hope you enjoy the show.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: This is for Spinner.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s Rainbow Randolph! Someone stop him!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sheldon!!!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: What’s he doing here?! He’s going to screw
everything up!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sheldon!!!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Nora…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re in on this, aren’t you! You sold him
out! You fucking snake!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Nora, please. It’s not what you think. I’m
grooming you. You’re going to run the division one day…</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: What now? What do we do now?!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Survival of the fittest!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sheldon!!! Get down!!!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Give me that gun, you fucking wacked-out
freak!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I don’t know. I’m kind of fucked up in
general, so it’s hard to gauge.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Burke’s with Stokes. He’s been in it all
along.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No, Sheldon, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You fucking point a gun at me? A gun I gave
you as a gift?! Where’s your fucking etiquette?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Now. Before I pump one in that Grecian Formula
scalp of yours.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You know something, kid? You’ve turned out to
be an incredible pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You were behind the Spinner hit, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: That was a tragic mistake. If only one could
turn back time… But what the hell, it’s just one less mick in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Oh my. What are you gonna do? Kill me? That
wouldn’t be very Smoochy-like behavior.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You’re right. There’s just one thing…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I’m not Smoochy.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I finally realized we’re living in a
different jungle.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No, Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sheldon!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t do it, Shel.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Stay out of it, Tommy. This is my
business.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No more killin’, Shel. Enough’s enough. Don’t
destroy who you are for this piece of shit. You mean something to the
kids. Don’t take Smoochy away from the kids.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: I don’t know how I got pushed this far.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re only human, Shel. The important thing
is… you never went over the cliff. You’re a good boy. For some of us…
it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’ll take it from here, kid, you run along
with your girl. Get on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: Tommy, you’re not going to –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t worry. Sometimes even a rat deserves a
little mercy.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Bus backfire.</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Move this thing!</p>
<p><strong>stokes</strong>: Are you deaf?! I said –</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I wish I could tell you it’ll be quick and
painless, Frank, but you know how these things go…</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: You know, a little grime here and there
doesn’t change the fact… it’s still a beautiful city.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Let’s go home, Smoochy. Show’s over.</p>
<p><strong>sheldon</strong>: No it’s not. It’s just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now… it gives us great pleasure to
introduce America’s favorite rhino… ladies and gentlemen… boys and
girls…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Heeeeeere’s Smoochy!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: With his partner and comrade… the one,
the only… Rainbow Randolph!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: All proceeds from tonight’s performance,
will benefit the Rainbow Randolph Center for Alcoholism and Delusional
Behavior.</p>
