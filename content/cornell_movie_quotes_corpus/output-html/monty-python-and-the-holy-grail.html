<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Whoa there!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Halt! Who goes there?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons,
sovereign of all England!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Get away!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I am… And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We
have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who
will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and
master.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What? Ridden on a horse?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’re using coconuts!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’ve got two empty halves of coconuts and
you’re banging them together.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter
covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Where did you get the coconuts?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Through … We found them.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Found them? In Mercea. The coconut’s
tropical!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Well, this is a temperate zone.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The swallow may fly south with the sun, or
the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet
these are not strangers to our land.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Not at all. They could be carried.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What? A swallow carrying a coconut?</p>
<p><strong>| arthur</strong>: | Why not? | | SOLDIER | I’ll tell you why
not … because a swallow is about eight | inches long and weighs five
ounces, and you’d be lucky | to find a coconut under a pound. |</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: It could grip it by the husk …</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It’s not a question of where he grips it,
It’s a simple matter of weight - ratios … A five-ounce bird could not
hold a a one pound coconut.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, it doesn’t matter. Go and tell your
master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs
to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.
right?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>second soldier</strong>: It could be carried by an African
swallow!</p>
<p><strong>first soldier</strong>: Oh yes! An African swallow maybe …
but not a European swallow. that’s my point.</p>
<p><strong>second soldier</strong>: Oh yes, I agree there …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Will you ask your master if he wants to join
the Knights of Camelot?!</p>
<p><strong>first soldier</strong>: But then of course African swallows
are non-migratory.</p>
<p><strong>second soldier</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>first soldier</strong>: So they wouldn’t be able to bring a
coconut back anyway.</p>
<p><strong>first soldier</strong>: No, they’d have to have it on a
line.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: Bring out your dead!</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: Bring out your dead!</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Here’s one!</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: Ninepence.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I’m not dead!</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Nothing… There’s your ninepence.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I’m not dead!</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: ’Ere. He says he’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: He isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: He will be soon. He’s very ill.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I’m getting better!</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: You’re not. You’ll be stone dead in a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: I can’t take him like this. It’s
against regulations.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I don’t want to go on the cart.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Don’t be such a baby.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: I can’t take him.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Do me a favour.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Well, can you hang around a couple of
minutes. He won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: I promised I’d be at the Robinson’s.
They’ve lost nine today.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: When’s your next round?</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I think I’ll go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: You’re not fooling anyone you know. Isn’t
there anything you could do?</p>
<p><strong>body</strong>: I feel happy… I feel happy.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: That’s all right. See you on
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Who’s that then?</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: I dunno, Must be a king.</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>cart driver</strong>: He hasn’t got shit all over him.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Old woman!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Man!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Man. I’m sorry. Old man, What knight live in
that castle over there?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m thirty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: :I’m thirty-seven … I’m not old.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: :Well - I can’t just say: “Hey, Man!’</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well you could say: “Dennis”</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I didn’t know you were called Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You didn’t bother to find out, did you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’ve said I’m sorry about the old woman, but
from the behind you looked …</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What I object to is that you automatically
treat me like an inferior …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well … I AM king.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you’ve got
a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how
d’you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences
in our society! If there’s EVER going to be any progress …</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Dennis! There’s some lovely filth down
here … Oh! how d’you do?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How d’you do, good lady … I am Arthur, King
of the Britons … can you tell me who lives in that castle?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: King of the WHO?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Britons.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Who are the Britons?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: All of us are … we are all Britons.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Ooooh! I didn’t know we had a king. I
thought we were an autonomous collective …</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You’re fooling yourself. We’re living in a
dictatorship, A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes
…</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: There you are, bringing class into it
again …</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: That’s what it’s all about … If only -</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Please, please good people. I am in haste.
What knight lives in that castle?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: No one live there.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, who is your lord?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: We don’t have a lord.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I told you, We’re an anarcho-syndicalist
commune, we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for
the week.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: … But all the decision of that officer …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, I see.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: … must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by
a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: … but a two-thirds majority …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Be quiet! I order you to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Order, eh – who does he think he is?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I am your king!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Well, I didn’t vote for you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You don’t vote for kings.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Well, how did you become king, then?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the
purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the
water to signify by Divine Providence … that I, Arthur, was to carry
Excalibur … That is why I am your king! | | OLD WOMAN | Is Frank in?
He’d be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look, strange women lying
on their backs in ponds handing out swords … that’s no basis for a
system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate
from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You can’t expect to wield supreme executive
power just ’cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I mean, if I went around saying I was an
Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people
would put me away!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shut up, will you. Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Ah! NOW … we see the violence inherent in
the system.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Come and see the violence inherent in the
system. Help, help, I’m being repressed!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Bloody peasant!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Come on, patsy.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: did you see him repressing me, then? That’s
what I’ve been on about …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You fight with the strength of many men, Sir
knight.</p>
<p><strong>| black knight</strong>: | Who dares to challenge the Black
Knight? | | ARTHUR | I do not challenge you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You have proved yourself worthy. … Will you
join me?</p>
<p><strong>| arthur</strong>: | A man of your strength and skill would
be the chief of all | my knights … | | BLACK KNIGHT | Never. | ARTHUR
You make me sad. But so be it. Come Patsy.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: None shall pass.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: None shall pass.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir
knight, but I must cross this bridge.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Then you shall die.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I command you, as King of the Britons to
stand aside.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: I move for no man.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So be it!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Now stand aside worthy adversary.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: ’Tis but a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: A scratch? Your arm’s off.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: No, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, what’s that then?</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: I’ve had worse.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’re a liar.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Come on you pansy!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Victory is mine. I thank thee O Lord that in
thy …</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Come on then.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the
fight is mine.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You stupid bastard. You havn’t got any arms
left.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Course I have.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: What! Just a flesh wound.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Had enough … ?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’ll have your leg.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: I’ll do you for that.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’ll what … ?</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Come Here.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What are you going to do. bleed on me?</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: I’m invincible!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You’re a looney.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: The Black Knight always triumphs. Have
at you!</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: All right, we’ll call it a draw.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Come, Patsy.</p>
<p><strong>black knight</strong>: Running away eh? You yellow bastard,
Come back here and take what’s coming to you. I’ll bite your legs
off!</p>

<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: A newt?</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: I got better.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Burn her anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir
Bedevere?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Tell me … what do you do with witches?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Burn them.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: And what do you burn, apart from
witches?</p>
<p><strong>fourth villager</strong>: … Wood?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: So why do witches burn?</p>
<p><strong>second villager</strong>: … Because they’re made of
wood…?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I see. Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: So how can we tell if she is made of
wood?</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: Make a bridge out of her.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Ah … but can you not also make bridges out
of stone?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Ah. Yes, of course … um … err …</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Does wood sink in water?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie
weights on her. To the pond.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Wait. Wait … tell me, what also floats on
water?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Bread? No, no, no. Apples …. gravy … very small
rocks …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: A duck.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Exactly. So… logically …</p>
<p><strong>first villager</strong>: If she … weighs the same as a duck …
she’s made of wood.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: And therefore?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: A witch! … A duck! A duck! Fetch a duck.</p>
<p><strong>fourth villager</strong>: Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: We shall use my largest scales.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Remove the supports.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: A witch! A witch!</p>
<p><strong>witch</strong>: It’s a fair cop.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Who are you who are so wise in the ways of
science?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: My liege … forgive me …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good Sir knight, will you come with me to
Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: My liege, I am honored.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Bedevere, my Liege.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Then I dub you … Sir Bedevere … Knight of
the Round Table!</p>

Loimbard.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Please go and tell your master that we have
been charged by God with a sacred quest, and if he will give us food and
shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy
Grail.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I’ll ask him, but I don’t think he’ll be
very keen. He’s already got one, you see?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>

storm your castle.</p>

boil your bottoms, son of a silly person. I blow my nose on you,

until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by
surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!</p>

badger…</p>

Sh!</p>
<p><strong>historian’s speech</strong>: Defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened King Arthur … The ferocity of the French
taunting took him completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to
be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his
closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the
Grail individually. Now, this is what they did. No sooner…</p>

| Er no, with my sword. | | SECOND HEAD | Dagger. | | THIRD HEAD | Mace
is quicker. | | FIRST HEAD | No, no, the sword, it’s easier. | | THIRD
HEAD | He said axe. | | ROBIN | Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut
your head off. | | THIRD HEAD | | For God’s sake, CUT that one off, and
do us all a favour. | | FIRST HEAD | What do you mean? | | THIRD HEAD |

<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: We were in the nick of time. You were in
great peril.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: I don’t think I was.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: You were, Sir Galahad, You were in
terrible peril.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Look, let me go back in there and face the
peril?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: It’s too perilous.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Look, it’s my duty as a knight to try and
sample as much peril as I can.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: No, no, we must find the Grail.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: No. It’s unhealthy.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: … I Bet you’re gay.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Sir Launcelot had saved Galahad from
almost certain temptation but they were still lost, far from the goal of
their search for the Holy Grail. Only Bedevere and King Arthur himself,
riding day and night, had made any progress.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And this “Enchanter” of whom you speak, he
has seen the grail?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Where does he live? Old man … where does he
live …</p>
<p><strong>soothsayer</strong>: He knows of a cave … a cave which no man
has entered.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And … the Grail … The Grail is there?</p>
<p><strong>soothsayer</strong>: There is much danger … for beyond the
cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But the Grail … where is the Grail!?</p>
<p><strong>soothsayer</strong>: Seek you the Bridge of Death …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Bridge of Death? … which leads to the
Grail?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight of ni</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Easy … boy, easy …</p>
<p><strong>six voices from darkness</strong>: NI! … Peng! … Neeee …
Wom!</p>

Who Say “Ni”!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: No! Not the Knights Who Say “Ni”!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: The same!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: We are the keepers of the sacred words.
NI … Peng … and Neee … Wom!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Those who hear them seldom live to tell
the tale.</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: The Knights Who Say “Ni”! demand a
sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Knights Who Say “Ni” … we are but simple
travellers. We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who
…</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: NI!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: NI! NI!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: We shall say Ni! again to you if you do
not appease us.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: All right! What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: We want … a shrubbery!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Ni! Ni! Ni … Peng … Nee … Wum!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: All right! All right! … No more, please. We
will find you a shrubbery …</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: You must return here with a shrubbery
or else … you shall not pass through this wood alive!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni! You are fair
and just. We will return with a shrubbery.</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: One that looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: And not too expensive.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes …</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Now - go!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: Ni! Ni!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: One day, lad, all this will be yours …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What - the curtains?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No! Not the curtains, lad … All that … all
that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys … as far as
the eye can see and beyond … that’ll be your kingdom, lad.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But, Mother …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Father, lad.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But, Father, I don’t really want any of
that.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from
nothing. All I had when I started was swamp … other kings said I was
daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same … just to
show ’em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one … that sank
into the swamp. I built another one … That fell over and THEN sank into
the swamp …. So I built another … and that stayed up. … And that’s what
your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But I don’t want any of that, I’d rather
…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Rather what?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’d rather … just … sing …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’re not going to do a song while I’m
here!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t want land.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen, Alice …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Herbert … We built this castle on a bloody
swamp, we need all the land we can get.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But I don’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t like her? What’s wrong with her? She’s
beautiful … she’s rich … she’s got huge tracts of land …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I know … but … I want the girl that I marry
to have … a certain … special … something …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Cut that out!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Make sure the Prince doesn’t leave this room
until I come and get him.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Not … to leave the room … even if you
come and get him.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No. Until I come and get him.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Until you come and get him, we’re not
to enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No … You stay in the room and make sure he
doesn’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: … and you’ll come and get him.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That’s Right.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: We don’t need to do anything, apart
from just stop him entering the room.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Leaving the room.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Leaving the room … yes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Er … if … we … er …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: If we … er …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Look, it’s simple. Just stay here and make
sure he doesn’t leave the room.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Right?</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Oh, I remember … can he … er … can he
leave the room with us?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No …. keep him in here … and make sure he
doesn’t …</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Oh, yes! we’ll keep him in here,
obviously. But if he had to leave and we were with him.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No … just keep him in here.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Until you, or anyone else …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, not anyone else - just me.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Just you …</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Get back.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Okay. Fine. We’ll remain here until you
get back.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And make sure he doesn’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Make sure he doesn’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: The Prince … ?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes … make sure …</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Oh yes, of course! I thought you meant
him! You know it seemed a bit daft me havin’ to guard him when he’s a
guard …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Oh, yes. That’s quite clear. No
problems.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: We’re coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, I want you to stay here and make sure he
doesn’t leave the room until I get back.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Oh, I see, Right.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut your noise, you, and get that suit
on!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And no singing!</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: Hic.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Go and have a drink of water.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: And … o v e r … we go!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Well taken, Concorde!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: Thank you, sir, most kind …</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: And another!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: Message for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Concorde - speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: “To whoever finds this note - I have been
imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry against my will. Please
please please please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of Swamp
Castle.”</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: At last! A call! A cry of distress …
Concorde! Brave, Concorde … you shall not have died in vain!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: I’m not quite dead, sir …</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Oh, well … er brave Concorde! You shall
not have been fatally wounded in vain!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: I think I could pull through, sir.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Good Concorde … stay here and rest
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: I think I’ll be all right to come with
you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: I will send help, brave friend, as soon
as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this
genre.</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: Really, I feel fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Farewell, Concorde!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: It just seems silly … me lying here.</p>
<p><strong>| first sentry</strong>: | Halt, friend … | LAUNCELOT leaps
into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and hacks him to
the floor. Blood. Swashbuckling music . LAUNCELOT races through into the
castle screaming.</p>
<p><strong>second sentry</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Ah! Now … we’re not allowed to …</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant,
Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot. I have come to take you … away
… I’m terribly sorry …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You got my note!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Well … yes …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You’ve come to rescue me?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Well … yes … but I hadn’t realised …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I knew that someone would come. I knew …
somewhere out there … there must be …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’m … your son …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: I’m … er … Sir Launcelot, sir.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: He’s come to rescue me, father.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Well, let’s not jump to conclusions …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Did you kill all those guards?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Yes … I’m very sorry …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: They cost fifty pounds each!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Well, I’m really am most awfully sorry
but I … I can explain everything …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Don’t be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot. I’ve
got a rope here all ready …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You killed eight wedding guests in all!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Er, Well … the thing is … I thought your
son was a lady.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I can understand that.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut up! You only killed the bride’s father
- that’s all -</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Oh dear, I didn’t really mean to…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Didn’t mean to? You put your sword right
through his head!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Gosh - Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You even kicked the bride in the chest! It’s
going to cost me a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: I can explain … I was in the forest …
riding north from Camelot … when I got this note.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Camelot? Are you from Camelot?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: I am, sir. I am a Knight of King
Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: ’Mm … very nice castle, Camelot … very good
pig country….</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Do you want to come and have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Oh … that’s awfully nice.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I am ready!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: It’s just that when I’m in this genre, I
tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword
about … and …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about that … Tell me …
doesn’t Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hold it! Please! LAUNCELOT Sorry! Sorry …
There you See … I just got excited again and I got carried away … I’m
ever so sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: He’s killed the best man!</p>
<p><strong>second guest</strong>: He’s killed my auntie.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, please! This is supposed to be a happy
occasion! Let’s not bicker and argue about who killed who … We are here
today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the
holy wedlock. Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just
fallen to his death.</p>
<p><strong>shout from back</strong>: He’s not quite dead!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Since the fatal wounding of her father …</p>
<p><strong>shout from back</strong>: I think He’s getting better!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: For … since her own father … who … when he
seemed about to recover … suddenly felt the icy … hand of death upon
him.</p>
<p><strong>shout from back</strong>: Oh, he’s died!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I want his only daughter, from now onwards,
to think of me as her old dad … in a very real and legally binding
sense.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: The dead Prince!</p>
<p><strong>concorde</strong>: He’s not quite dead!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I feel much better.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You fell out of the Tall Tower you
creep!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I was saved at the last minute.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Well … I’ll tell you …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Not like that!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: He’s going to tell.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: He’s going to tell …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut UP!</p>
<p><strong>| launcelot</strong>: | We must escape. Quickly before the
song. | | CONCORDE | Come with me, sir. | | LAUNCELOT | You’re not right
for this genre … I must escape more dramatically. | + + CONCORDE +
Quickly, sir, come this way! + + LAUNCELOT + No! It’s not right for my
idiom. I must escape more … more … + + CONCORDE + Dramatically, sir? + +
LAUNCELOT + Dramatically. + CROWD He’s going to tell He’s going to tell
He’s going to tell about his great escape. Oh he fell a long long way
But he’s here with us today What a wonderful … escape.</p>
<p><strong>+ launcelot</strong>: + Excuse me … could somebody give me a
push … +</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Is there anywhere where we could buy a
shrubbery?</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Knights Who Say Ni!</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: Aaaagh! No! We have no shrubberies here.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Surely, there must be. | | ARTHUR
restrains from threatening the LADY. | | ARTHUR | | It will be not good
to argue. These simple people are terrified | of the Knights Who Say Ni!
| | CRONE | | Ohhh! | | ARTHUR takes BEDEVERE further aside. | | ARTHUR
| There is only one way to get the information we want … | | BEDEVERE |
Send her a letter from a long way away? | | ARTHUR | Er, no … no, we
must … | | BEDEVERE | Talk to her in funny voices? | | ARTHUR | | No … |
| BEDEVERE | How about trying ourselves to a tree? | | ARTHUR | |
No. Our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of | the
awful Knights Who Say Ni! | | BEDEVERE | | Ah! Hit ourselves with a big
rock … | | He nods knowingly. | | ARTHUR | | No. Nothing we do to
ourselves will frighten her as much as | what we can do to her … | |
BEDEVERE | Ah! | | ARTHUR | We must threaten to say “Ni”! | | BEDEVERE |
| Oh, no. | | They reapproach the OLD CRONE who is cowering more than
ever. | ARTHUR Listen, old crone! Unless you tell us where we can buy a
shrubbery, my friend and I will … we will say “Ni!”</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: Do your worst! | I have herd the Knights say
“Ni”! in the night. I have herd the | hideous Peng! and they have said
“Nee-wum”! to my sister but still | I have not revealed …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Very well, old crone. Since you will not
assist us voluntarily … “Ni”!</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: No. Never. No shrubberies.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Nu!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No. Ni! More like this. “Ni”!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Ni, ni, ni!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: | It’s not working. You’re not doing it
properly. Ni!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: That’s it. Ni! Ni!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Are you saying “Ni” to that old woman?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Erm, yes.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Oh, what sad times are these when passing
ruffians can say “Ni” at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon
this land! nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design
shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this point in
time.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Did you say shrubberies?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a
shrubber. My name is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell
shrubberies.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No. No. No!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.
May we go now?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: That is a good shrubbery. I like the
laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: We are now no longer the Knights Who
Say Ni!</p>
<p><strong>one knight</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>one knight</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow …
wum … ping!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>one knight</strong>: Peng!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Sh! Sh!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Therefore … we are no longer
contractually bound by any agreements previously entered into by the
Knights Who Say Ni!</p>
<p><strong>one knight</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: Peng!</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Shut up! Therefore, we must give you a
test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who say Neeeow … wum … ping!</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: Neeeow … wum … ping!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What is this test, Knights of N… … Recently
Knights of Ni!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Ni!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Firstly. You must get us another
shrubbery!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: More shrubberies! More shrubberies
for the ex-Knights of Ni!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Not another shrubbery -</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: When you have found the shrubbery,
place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery … only slightly higher,
so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: A path! A little path for the late
Knights of Ni!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: When you have found the shrubbery, then
you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest … with a herring.</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: Yes! With a herring! With a herring!
Cut down with a herring!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We shall do no such thing … let us pass!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Oh, please!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can’t be
done!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Don’t say that word.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What word?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: I cannot tell you. Suffice to say is
one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How can we not say the word, if you don’t
tell us what it is?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: You said it again!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What, “is”?</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: No, no … not “is”!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: Not “is”! Not “is”!</p>
<p><strong>sir robin’s singers</strong>: Bravely good Sir Robin was not
at all afraid To have his eyeballs skewered …</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: “Is” is all right … You wouldn’t get
far not saying “Is”!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: My liege, it’s Sir Robin!</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: You’ve said the word again!</p>
<p><strong>singers</strong>: … and his kidneys burnt and his nipples
skewered off …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Sir Robin!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My liege! It’s good to have found you again
…</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Now he’s said the word!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Where are you going good Sir Robin?</p>
<p><strong>robin’s singers</strong>: He was going home … he was giving
up, He was throwing in the sponge.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Shut up! No … er … no … I … er … I … er … I
certainly wasn’t giving up … I was actually looking for the grail … er
thing … in this forest.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No … it lies beyond this forest.</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Stop saying the word!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: Stop saying the word! The word we
cannot hear! The word …</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, stop it!</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: They’re all saying the word …</p>
<p><strong>tall knight</strong>: Stop saying it. AAAArghh! … I’ve said
it …</p>
<p><strong>other knights</strong>: You’ve said it! Aaaaarghhh! … We’ve
said it … Wwe’re all saying it.</p>
<p><strong>| tall knight</strong>: | Well, At least We’ve got ONE
shrubbery. | | OTHER KNIGHTS | Yes, Yes … We’ve Done very Well … NI! | |
TALL KNIGHT | Ssh! I think somebody’s coming. We’ll get them to give us
| another shrubbery. | | OTHER KNIGHTS | Good Idea. More shrubberies. As
many as possible. | | Perhaps we start to TRACK BACK from the scene as
they go on talking. | | TALL KNIGHT | What shall we call ourselves this
time? | | KNIGHT | How about “The knights of Nicky-Nicky”? | | |28
EXTERIOR - DAY | | A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a

BRIAN’S ADVISERS stand around | him. Everyone bears the signs of past
injuries I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the

from BEDEVERE. | | They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car
and drive off. | | |30 EXTERIOR - DAY | | Back in KING BRIAN’s Court.

The GUARDS drag the ADVISER roughly away. | | SECOND ADVISER | No! | | |
KING BRIAN | | I will personally disembowel the next little bastard who
tells me that | there are no more close harmony … | | At this moment we
hear faintly the sound of singing. KING BRIAN stopped | to listen. The
entire COURT turns thankfully towards the mellifluous | sounds. | |
We’re the knights of the round table | our shows are formidable | but
many times we’re given rhymes | that are quite unsingable… | | KING
BRIAN | Wait a minute! Five point harmony with a counter-tenor lead! | |
Various members of the COURT sigh and breathe more easily. | | CREEP |

KNIGHTS | No fear etc. | | SECOND ADVISER | | It need not be close
harmony oooh agh! | | SIR GALAHAD | Ah but it would get round to close
harmony, wouldn’t it? | | SECOND ADVISER | Not necessarily … As I say
king Brian is much more relaxed than | he used to be. | | SIR GALAHAD |
I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of |
straight choral work? | | SECOND ADVISER | Well obviously he’d prefer a
bit of close harmony arghhh! | | KNIGHTS | Ah! There you are! | | SIR

… iron spikes though your heads. | | KNIGHTS | Ah! That sounds more like
Brian the wild! | | SECOND ADVISER | | He … he … still gets irritable
occasionally. | | SIR GALAHAD | Like with close harmony groups. | |
SECOND ADVISER | Ooh … Look if you’re scared … | | SIR LANCELOT | We’re
not SCARED! | | SECOND ADVISER | | Very well! King Brian challenges your
to sing before him in close | harmony! | | ARTHUR | A challenge? | | The
KNIGHTS look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow |
suffuses KING ARTHUR’s eyes as he looks heaven-wards. The other KNIGHTS
| look at him rather fearfully. | | ARTHUR | | It is a challenge. We
cannot refuse. | | SIR GALAHAD | King Brian’s a fucking looney. | |
SECOND ADVISER | Great! | | | SIR GALAHAD | Are you all right? | | CUT
TO KING BRIAN the wild on his dias. he sees the KNIGHTS enter | the
arena. | | KING BRIAN | Ah good! | | CUT TO TRUMPETERS who executes a
rather bad fanfare full of missed | notes. meanwhile various SHOTS of
preparation. | | KING BRIAN settling down. | | KNIGHTS being led up to
the podium. the last of the previous close harmony | group is being
loaded onto a cart and pushed away by the cart driver | from scene tow |
| SHOT of KING BRIAN on his podium and the HERALD being untied and
having | his gag removed. | | SHOT of ARTHUR and KNIGHTS getting into a
group on the podium still | rather nervous. | | The fanfare comes to an
end, and several wrong notes. | | KING BRIAN | | RIGHT! Carry on
gentleman. | | HERALD | KING BRIAN SAYS CARRY ON! | | ARTHUR | | All
right … two tenor lines - I’ll take the base. | | They all nod. | | One…
Two… Three… | | Sound of Bows being drown very near by. | | ARTHUR looks
up and frowns. | | CUT to reveal a line of twenty ARCHERS they all have
their left leg | missing, but they DO have two arms. | | Their arrows
are drawn back and point directly at ARTHUR &amp; CO. | | ARTHUR | Hold
it! Err … King Brian! | | HERALD | | ARTHUR OF CAMELOT ADDRESSES THEE OH
MIGHTY KING BRIAN! | | KING BRIAN | | What? | | ARTHUR | What are THEY

ONE-LEGGED RSM | Left … Left … Left, left, left, left | Left … Left …
Left, left, left, left. | | They hop round behind a long fence and
disappear from sight | | | KING BRIAN | Right! Ready when you are. | |
HERALD | KING BRIAN IS READY! | | ARTHUR | And … One … Two … Three …
Four … | | They are just about to sing when the ARCHERS, bows read and
arrows points, | peep over the top of the fence. | | HOLD IT! | | SIR
GAWAIN | | We’re | | Quick flash of ARCHERS sensed to fire, one tires to
hold his shot back but | fails and fires his arrows by accident in the
air. | | Quick flash of FIRST ADVISER who is hanging by his nostrils
from the | highest tree in the kingdom, moaning, getting hit by the
arrow. | | KING BRIAN | What is it now? | | ARTHUR | We’re not entirely
happy with the acoustics. | | HERALD | THEY’RE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH…
| | KING BRIAN | | Oh Sod the acoustics! Get on with the singing! | |
HERALD | KING BRIAN SAYS SOD THE ACOUSTICS! | | ARTHUR | In that case we
shall just have to perform elsewhere. | | | HERALD | THEY SAY IN THAT

concealment - fitting arrows into their bows. | | HERALD | KING BRIAN
CALLS THEM BASTARDS AND DEMANDS TO HEAD CLOSE HARMONY! | WHAT WILL
HAPPEN NEXT? | | KING BRIAN | I said don’t. | | HERALD | Sorry, King. |
| KING BRIAN | Right! On the count of three … one … | | HERALD | THE
KING’S SAID ONE! | | KING BRIAN | Two! | | HERALD | THE KING’S SAID TWO!
THEY’VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT! | | We hear the sound of bows being drawn
back. Tension mounts. the KNIGHTS | all look pretty grim. The end is
clearly pretty near. | | KING BRIAN | | Three! | | HERALD | THREE! | |
Sound in the distance of beautiful close harmony singing | | “Bravely,
good sir robin was not at all afraid…” | | CUT TO see SIR ROBIN and his
MINSTRELS approaching from round a corner | of the castle. SIR ROBIN
walks a few feet in from of the them looking | rather embarrassed. | |
KING BRIAN | | FANTASTIC! | | CUT BACK TO ROBIN’S MINSTRELS | | “To have
his eyeballs skewered and his kidneys … argh!” | | They are suddenly
pin-cushioned with arrows. | | KING BRIAN | HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO!
HO! | Oh bloody marvellous! | | ROBIN turns and looks at the decimated
remains of his MINSTRELS, surprised | but relieved. | | ARTHUR | Sir

joined by their PAGES and | make good their escape. | | KING BRIAN | HA!
HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! | | HERALD | KING BRIAN’S SHOT THE

<p><strong>voice over</strong>: And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin
set out on their search to find the Enchanter of whom the old man had
spoken in scene twenty-four. Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and
Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.</p>

forced to eat Robin’s minstrels … And there was much rejoicing … A year
passed …</p>

<p><strong>tim</strong>: To the north there lies a cave, the cave of
Caerbannog, wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock,
the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged …</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: … make plain the last resting place of the most
Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How shall we find this cave, O Tim?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Follow!</p>
<p><strong>+ arthur</strong>: + What an eccentric performance! +</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shhh!</p>

<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: You cretin!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: That is not an ordinary rabbit … ’tis the most
foul cruel and bad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You tit. I soiled my armour I was so
scared!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: That rabbit’s got a vicious streak. It’s a

<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, It’s got huge … very sharp … it can jump
a… look at the bones.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Go on, Bors, chop its head off.</p>
<p><strong>bors</strong>: Right. Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew
coming up.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Je…sus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I warned you!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I done it again.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Did I tell you? Did you listen to me? Oh no,
no, you knew better didn’t you? No, it’s just an ordinary rabbit isn’t
it. The names you called me. Well, don’t say I didn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: It’s always the same … if I’ve said it
once.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Charge!</p>
<p><strong>all knights</strong>: Run away! Run away!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Who did we lose?</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Sir Gawain.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Ector.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And Bors. Five. + + GALAHAD + Three, sir! +
ARTHUR Three. Well, we’ll not risk another frontal assault. That
rabbit’s dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Would it help to confuse him if we ran away
more.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shut up. Go and change your armour.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Let us taunt it. It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Do we have any bows?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. ’Tis one
of the sacred relics Brother Maynard always carries with him.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How does it … er …</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: I know not.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Consult the Book of Armaments.</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: Armaments Chapter Two Verses Nine
to Twenty One.</p>
<p><strong>another monk</strong>: And St. Attila raised his hand grenade
up on high saying “O Lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.”and the Lord did
grin and people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and
anchovies and orang-utans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and…</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: Skip a bit brother …</p>
<p><strong>another monk</strong>: … Er … oh, yes … and the Lord spake,
saying, “First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count
to three, no more, no less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count,
and the number of the counting shalt be three. Four shalt thou not
count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to
three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number,
be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards
thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: One, two | , three … + , five … + + GALAHAD
+ Three, sir! + + ARTHUR + Three. + ARTHUR throws the grenade at the
RABBIT. There is an explosion and cheering from the KNIGHTS.</p>
<p><strong>all knights</strong>: Praise be to the lord. Huzzah!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: There! Look!</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: What language is this?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: It is Aramaic!</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Of course. Joseph of Aramathea!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: It reads … “Here may be found the
last words of Joseph of Aramathea.”</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: “The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh…”</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: He must have died while carving
it.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: That’s what it says.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: But if he was dying, he wouldn’t bother to
carve “Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh”. He’d just say it.</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: It’s down there carved in
stone.</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Perhaps he was dictating.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Shut up. Is that all it says?</p>
<p><strong>brother maynard</strong>: That’s all.
“Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh”.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: “Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh”.</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: Do you think he meant the Camargue?</p>
<p><strong>galahad</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: France, I think.</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: Isn’t there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh’s in
Cornwall?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, that’s Saint Ives.</p>
<p><strong>| robin</strong>: | Hey! | | BEDEVERE | No, that’s in

BEDEVERE + Oooooh! + + LAUNCELOT + No “Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh …” at the back
of the throat. + + BEDEVERE + No! “Oooooh!” in surprise and alarm! + He
indicated the entrance of the cave. They all turn and look. There in the
opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon beast.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh! GALAHAD My God!</p>
<p><strong>launcelot</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: I know! I know! I Know!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bedevere</strong>: It’s the … oh … it’s the … it’s on the tip

OF VISION. ARTHUR turns. | | ARTHUR | Who was that? | | HECTOR | | It
was Sir Alf. | | ARTHUR | I didn’t know we had a Sir Alf. | | HECTOR |
He was feeding it bread. | | ARTHUR | | Well, that was a very silly
thing to do. Now the rest of you stand | well back from the BLACK BEAST
of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | | HECTOR | Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | | ROBIN | Look
out. | | The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them. The
KNIGHTS retreat | into the darkness of the cave. | | GAWAIN | | It’s
only a cartoon. | | ARTHUR | Sh!</p>
<p><strong>+ voice over</strong>: + As the horrendous Black Beast lunged
forward, escape for Arthur + and his knights seemed hopeless, when,

<p><strong>| galahad</strong>: | Look! | + GALAHAD + There it is! + +
ARTHUR + The Bridge of Death! + + ROBIN + + Oh! Great … | | They look
and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone | which
bears the words: “Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles” and an arrow. | | ARTHUR |
God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke | in
scene twenty-four. | | The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous
track edging along | the side of the mountain. GALAHAD is leading. | |
MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher. The path gets more and more |
slippery and dangerous. They reach another milestone which says: |
“Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 4 miles” and an arrow, and “Ni! 82 miles” and | an
arrow pointing in the opposite direction. They go on. It is | dangerous
and difficult. Tension in their faces. | | As they are climbing,
BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR. | | BEDEVERE | We must find the
bridge … the Bridge of Death … | | ROBIN | | Oh, great! | | BEDEVERE |
The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveller | three
questions. And he who answers the three questions can | cross in safety.
| | ROBIN | | And if you get a question wrong? | | BEDEVERE | You are
cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. | |34 EXTERIOR - DAY | | CUT TO
them struggling along. Perhaps downhill now. It is growing misty. | SIR
LAUNCELOT stops them and points. They peer. | | CUT TO see in the mist …
a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the | gorge below. We cannot
see the other side. | | Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the
blind soothsayer they | met earlier in the forest. | | ARTHUR | | He’s
the Keeper of the Bridge. It’s the old man. | | BEDEVERE | | Who’s going
to answer the questions? | | ARTHUR | You go, Robin, and God be with
you. | | ROBIN | | Er … I tell you what - | | Why doesn’t Launcelot go?
| | ARTHUR | | Very well … Sir Launcelot. Brave Sir Launcelot. This is
the Bridge | of Death … | | LAUNCELOT | Oh, yes sir … I will take it
single-handed. | | I will … | | ARTHUR restrains him. | | ARTHUR | No,
hang on. All we want is for you to approach the old man | and he will
ask you three questions. Answer those question as | best you can, and we
will watch … and pray. | | LAUNCELOT | Yes, my liege … | | ARTHUR | Good
luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful … | | They shake hands, Arthur’s
eyes moisten. LAUNCELOT approaches the | Bridge of Death. | | ARTHUR |

How can they cross?</p>
