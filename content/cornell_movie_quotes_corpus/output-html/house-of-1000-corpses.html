<p><strong>girl</strong>: Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest little
guy. Then one day he got sick and died. My heart was broken. My whole
body hurt.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: After that, I saw things differently,
everything could be summed up with three simple words… fuck the
world.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC’s
Halloween monster weekend. I’m Jimmy Ray and I’ll be bringing you the
oldies, the goldies and sometimes the moldies. The good, the bad and the
uglies straight from the WJRC vaults.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Hey, kids still trying to decide on
the right costume? Well why not head on down to Randall’s Penny Save
located on Kimball Rd. just off route 1 in Mackin County. Choose from a
wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers… …everything you
need for your Halloween needs.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Alright let’s get back to our
monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear’s
Picnic.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: I… I got back a stack today. Some nice
shots. See, a good topless June Wilkinson… unfortunately she
personalized it… to Stucky, love June.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Hmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Shit, this ain’t worth nothing now that my
name gotten all over it. I was a fixin’ on trading it to Jackie
Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: The retard over at Molly’s fruit
stand.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Yeah, he’s all hot on her after he found
some of his dad’s old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps ’em
taped inside his school workbook.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: That kid is one horny retard.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Christ, ain’t they all. All them
retards wanna do is fuck and eat.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Well, yeah… I think that if you knew him… I
mean if you’d understand his urges, shit the guy’s like forty or
something.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Worse than a fucking rabid
baboon.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his
weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the
corner of his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Yeah, doesn’t hurt himself, just spins it
around next to his eyeball.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: I’m sure that ain’t the only place
he’s sticking those pencils.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Naw, he don’t do anything else with ’em, but
he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had
Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn’t get it out.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: I always loved that mute broad that
Chuck Heston was shacking up with.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yeah, now there’s the perfect
woman.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Can I get some stamps off ya? Did you fix
the toilet yet?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yes, I did… so don’t you go
stuffin’ any goddamn paper towels down that hole. I just snaked the shit
out of that thing.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Ya hear me? You bust that crapper
and I’ll beat your ass.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: I hear ya.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All clear. Let’s go shopping.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Mary fucking Moses. Get the fuck
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hold it, clowney. Keep your paws where I can
see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Yeah, don’t move or I’ll blast a hole the size
of a Kansas City melon through your ugly-ass Bozo face.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Go get that other asshole out of the shitter
and drag his ass back in here.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Miserable little cunts with guns. I
ought to jump right over this counter and bash your fucking balls
in.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Alright Tippy, hand over the cash box and I
might leave your brains inside your skull.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: That’s what you bitches need. A
reality check courtesy of my boot in your ass. That’ll be a fucking cash
box you can cry to mamma about.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Come on, fatboy!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That’s it. I’m gonna count to ten and you’re
gonna hand over the cash or I’m gonna splatter your grease paint mug
across the stateline… one.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Fuck your mother.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Fuck your sister.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Come on, man. Just shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Hey, I know you. We were in high school
together. Wood shop, right? …Richard Wick… right?</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Shut up, shut up, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Quiet down… three.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Fuck your grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop
teacher use’ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn’t there a song we
made up to go with that?</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>stucky</strong>: Little Dick Wick, play with his prick Don’t
his smell, just make you sick.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: And most of all… fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: God damn it, that motherfucker got
blood all over my best clown suit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Alright then, out of all of Charlie’s chicks
who do you think is the hottest?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I guess if I had to choose I’d say… mmmmmm…
Sandra Good. She seemed like a nice girl, I mean in a psycho kind of
way.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really? Huh, I thought for sure you’d say
Lynette Fromme. She’s got that snooty vibe I know you dig.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sqeaky! No way, she ain’t that hot.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s pretty cute.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I
remember from fourth grade… called a… shit, what did we call her? Oh
yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants… when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski,
this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There always one kid with no bodily controls.
We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit
there puke all over himself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Better than pissing… anyway so, what’s your
choice?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If we’re talking cute… like regular cute, I’d
say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain’t hot.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, no shit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: As far a hot… goes I gotta go with… Ruth Ann
Moorehouse.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty
hot.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fuck yeah, she is. I’d join a cult to get
some of that… and the best part is she didn’t try to kill the President
or nothing, so that baggage ain’t hanging around.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I thought she tried to murder a witness for
the prosecution.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll let it slide, she was only
seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dude, talk about baggage, that ain’t no
carry-on shit, that’s some heavy duty Samsonite shit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, I guess… hot chicks are always
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hot has got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hold on, I’ve heard this before… but I can’t
remember the end.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says,
“do you smoke?” The guy say, “yeah”… the devil say, “great cause Tuesday
is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shit, we really need to find some gas.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then the devil asks, “do you drink?” Guy
says, “yeah”… devil say, “wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night,
best booze you ever had… all made from the finest stuff.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then the devil says, “are you gay?” Guy says,
“fuck no”… Devil says, “Well then, I guess you’re gonna hate
Thursdays.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yeah, I remember now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, no shit I just told ya. Hey, you think
this place called Alien Ed’s UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It
says, “Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I dunno… we’ll ask around as we get closer.
Man, I really don’t want to run out of gas out here in the middle of
Petticoat Junction, man.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t panic yourself, way too much caffeine
guy… I see a sign. Captain Spaulding’s Museum of Madmen and Monsters…
cool. Also… fried chicken and… gasoline… next exit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I hope this place is cool. We could use
something interesting to liven up chapter 12.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it’s
worth thinking about.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: OK, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It’s
awesome.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How awesome?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really fucking awesome.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera
awesome?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hell yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a kick ass
place.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Grab Mary and come inside.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to
work.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Rise and shine.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No please, let me sit this one out.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Let’s go. You’re the one who wanted to be a
photographer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I resign.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Too late. You’re in for life, let’s move it
out Private Shutterbug.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Christ, I hope this isn’t more crappy folk
art. It’s so quaint… it’s so primal… it’s so crap.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Aw, it ain’t crap… it’s… cute. …and really
who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Aw, shit… I gotta pee anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I ain’t no rich man, but I see the truth. You
do not have to go to Hell. You are in Hell. This is Hell. All American
Hell. …true heaven in my hands… I’m gonna blow Satan back through the
door to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How long have you been running this place?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: How long is a piece of string? Too
God damn long, that’s how long.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Shit, I don’t remember exactly. I
took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Duke?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yeah, my Pa wasn’t right in the
head after that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You mean John Wayne?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Hell, boy there some other Duke you
know about? A great American.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I
like science fiction.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: I figured that much. Why the fuck
you asking so many jackass questions for?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You see me and my friends are writing a book
on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see
when you drive cross country.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: I don’t drive cross country.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But if you did.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But suppose for a second you did.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Y’all find us country people real
funny like don’t ya… well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some
grits, I’ze a gotta get me some schooling.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, no I think it’s really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Well fuck me Side Sally, who want
to read about all that horse shit anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’d be surprised. Would it be OK if we took
some pictures and included this place in our book?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Hey, knock yourself silly.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You got some really rare stuff here… …dig
your Feegee mermaid.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I swear I’ve aged five years since this trip
started.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon.
Now I’ll be up all night… …ugh, my back is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from
your Dad’s?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I don’t know. Couple hours I think. I’ve got
to call him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It will be nice to have a few days off to
regenerate. This trip is fun, but it’s starting to get brutal.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old
stripper lady’s place. Watching her dance around with those
ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a
million years would have believed it if I hadn’t seen it.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: A decent meal every once in a while wouldn’t
hurt either, this road food is crap.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If I never eat at another Waffle House again,
I can die a happy girl.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Scattered, smothered and covered.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Exactly… well, I guess a couple more photos
won’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Great, you’re back. Let’s go. We already paid
for the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Tickets for what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This isn’t everything. Get ready for this…
there’s a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I don’t want to see that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How about if we skip it and just hang out
here. I can get some great shots of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Aw, come on. It will be fun.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Oh yeah, murder museum… sounds fun.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll need pictures of the inside too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Alright, alright. I know… I wanted to be the
photographer.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Anytime this year, people. Alright
line your asses up in front of the black door. The tour is about to
begin.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, you are about
to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are
meaningless and pain is God. To your left you see the infamous Albert
Fish.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Sadist, masochist, child killer and
most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning
himself with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and
embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray…</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: …showing clearly 29 sewing needles
inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of
65.</p>
<p><strong>close up on</strong>: a dummy face of a grizzly looking old
man in hunting attire.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: To your right. One of our most
popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Murderer, cannibal and momma’s
little bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special pleasure in playing with the
dead bodies of women, especially their sexual organs. He was quite a
handy little dandy, fashioning lamp shades, jewelry and human skin suits
from his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of
Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: And now I would like to introduce a
local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse
Nellie and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Murderer, torturer and most of all
master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern at Willows State Mental Hospital,
nicknamed Weeping Willows for its neverending cries of pain, took great
pleasure in control. Through primitive brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed
he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill, or so the
story goes. His terrifying experiments continued until 1952.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: At which time he was discovered and
turned over to authorities for observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale was
abducted from his cell by members of the victims’ families. Vigilante
justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was taken out and hanged. The next day
his body was found to be missing. Some say he survived, rescued by his
loyal slaves, others say they hung the wrong man… To this day no sign of
Dr. Satan has ever been discovered. But who knows? Maybe he lives next
door to you.</p>
<p><strong>klunk</strong>: A big metal door opens to the outside
world.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Please exit through the door.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Hello… …hey Denise… what, what’s wrong,
did you break down?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: No, nothing like that… yeah, we’re gonna be
a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding’s
outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we’re kind of
behind schedule.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Oh yeah, yeah I’ve driven by that place
before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit
running the place.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, well he’s still here. I think him and
Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry… yeah, he’s gotta see
everything… yeah, I know… thinks there’s some unsolved mystery around
every corner.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Well, don’t take too long, the kids are
already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix… I know, I know
I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they’re
trick or treating tonight… I got the joint decked out this year, built a
graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Hopefully I can move things along here and
make up the lost time by speeding all the way home… yes, Dad I’m
kidding.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Well, just promise me you’ll be careful…
alright, alright see ya soon… good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m gonna go ask him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Aw, come on Jerry. We’ve gotten all we’re
gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shit, it is only sprinkling and it’s worth
the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah so… OK, expect us more around eleven or
so. OK yeah, I will… love you, too, bye.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I know it’s hard to understand, but I really
want to see this tree.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: OK, alright I’ll draw you a map,
but I still say it is a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Geez, he never gets tired does he.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he
goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He’s always working on 10.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe he’s a cyborg.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I like sleep.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We hit the jackpot! Let’s roll, good buddy.
We got ourselves a convoy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Ugh, what’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fried chicken. Anybody want some?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t know where that skunk ape sleeps.
Maybe in the trees and all… all I know is he eats squirrels to survive
and he had impure relations with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: That’s true. He performed lurid acts upon me
and my person while my husband Russell was a fix’n to our hound
Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: If I see that thing again… I’m a gonna kill
that skunk ape.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: It looked just like that chubby fella from
McHale’s Navy… Ernie Borgnine.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hold up the picture.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Keep straight on this road here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not exactly sure… it looks close. Did we
pass an abandoned school bus yet?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let’s just skip it. It is probably nothing
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Aw Christ, Jerry. We can’t see anything now,
it’s too dark. Let’s forget it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on, we need something like this. It
could be the real deal. It’s too far out of the way to come back to.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s a hitchhiker.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Way out here?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, don’t even think about playing the good
samaritan, there’s way too many psychos wandering loose these days.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s a girl.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, maybe she knows where this is?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: That seems likely.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Should we stop?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We can’t leave her out here in the rain… maybe
we can just drop her at the next rest area.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She looks like a freak.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Stick her in the front, if you want to pick
her up so bad. She’s soaked.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She looks like she stinks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She looks like she stinks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Cat fight, cat fight.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Hardy har, har.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out
there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really, that’s a long time.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was
invisible or something… or else they’re creeps who wanna jam their slimy
hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yikes.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in
and he’s got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Well, hitchhiking ain’t the safest way for a
girl to travel.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, but it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sounds like a magical trip through the
heartland.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where ya headed?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Aw, I was going home to my Mamma’s house…
yeah, I was out doing this thing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Couple more miles up this road.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, you might know… …you know where this
tree is at? It’s an old hanging tree from…</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, I know where that is, it’s right by my
house. It’s Dr. Satan’s tree. I can show ya.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really, wow, so it’s really a real thing.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, it’s a tree. I used to play there all
the time. But, you can’t find it without me. Outsider can’t find no
deadwood.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Deadwood, is that what it’s called? Cool,
will you show us?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Maybe, maybe, maybe… hey, you know what word I
hate?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Cone.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Huh… what cone?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Any cone, yeah… I hate that word… sounds ugly,
I don’t like crumple either.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I always hate saying the word cheese, every
time you get your picture taken… smile, say cheese.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What about the tree?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh yeah, the tree.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is crazy. She don’t know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh, I know. I’ll show you where it’s at,
sweetie. Aren’t you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of
Christmas love.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Go straight up about another mile… til we hit
Cherrypicker Road and turn right… it ain’t far from there.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: This is WJRC News at the top of the
hour… Investigators in Clairemont County are no closer to identifying
the body of a young woman found crucified to the doors of St. Mary’s
Church yesterday morning.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Excuse me, could you not smoke in here?</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Local police and State Officials have
released this report…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t know. Looks like some kind of
animal.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why are we stopping?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There’s a dog in the road.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Honk at him. Scare him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He won’t move.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Go around him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There’s not enough room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then run him over, he’ll move.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: No! He’s one of God’s creatures, he can’t help
it if he’s dumb… I’m just crazy about animals.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The animals have got nothing to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, he moved.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let’s get going before that thing tries to eat
the car or something.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy
who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a
lion cub and got eaten by the lions.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought
it was bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No… yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his
family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying.
Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I’d like to see that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The lions were totally covered in this guy’s
blood… I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his
legs off… it was a wild scene.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya
think.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck. I think we blew a tire.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t even say it.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: You got to be fucking joking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was
fucking bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: OK, let’s relax. I’ll check it, maybe I’m
wrong. Don’t everybody freak out just yet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll help ya.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Gee, ya think it wouldn’t be too much
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I hope you fixed the spare like I asked
ya.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain’t… um, I can’t
remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it
back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jesus Christ, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, technically I did what ya said.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re a real fucking piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can I help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I was just wondering.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wondering what?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Are you two gals all funny with each
other?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: You know… a couple of queers.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you believe this fucking girl?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy
look about you… like a real pussy licking bitch.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: No. No pussy licking here, but thanks for
your concern.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I got some bad news and some bad
news.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Tire’s fucking gone crap on us, man. There’s
no saving it now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry’s
garage.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What the hell are you laughing about?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair
watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I guess I’ll try to back it out on the rim… at
least to the main road.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: If you keep going straight you can get back on
the interstate… it’s easier.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just back up.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I think we should go straight. I mean we know
for a fact there ain’t nothing back that way, right?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh wait! I love this song!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fine. I’ll go straight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fine! I’ll go straight!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck! We are fucked!</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Turn that fucking radio off!</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Now what are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: We can walk to my house from here. My
brother’s got a tow truck, he can come get your car.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think I’m going fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I can’t believe…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: OK, whatever. Let’s go get your brother’s
truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll go. It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You said it, not me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Forget it. I’ll just go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Screw that, no way, I ain’t letting you go by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll be quick. Just stay here, no
sense everybody getting drenched.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, it won’t take long and besides you sassy
poodle girls will slow us down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t forget the flashlight, it’s pretty dark
out there.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>miss bunny</strong>: Hi, I’m Miss Bunny and welcome to my
Hollywood Revue… …where the stars shine forever.</p>
<p><strong>miss bunny</strong>: Hi, this is the place where the magic
happens.</p>
<p><strong>miss bunny</strong>: This is Jenny, she is our resident
Ingrid Bergman.</p>
<p><strong>miss bunny</strong>: This is Ronald J. Perrywinckle… our
Humphrey Bogart… today we’ll be doing a scene from Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>humphrey cat</strong>: If that plane leaves the ground and
you’re not with him you’ll regret it… maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid squirrel</strong>: But what about us?</p>
<p><strong>humphrey cat</strong>: We’ll always have Paris. We didn’t
have, we lost it… until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last
night.</p>
<p><strong>ingrid squirrel</strong>: When I said I would never leave
you.</p>
<p><strong>humphrey cat</strong>: And you never will.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Almost there… are you in a hurry or
something?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, yeah, kind of.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Fuck, it’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, listen to this… I think this is related
to our Dr. Satan.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, in this book there’s a chapter called
Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to
work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men
of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case
where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to
become an arm-less wonder.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of
four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It says, “records show that Ellie Thompson
was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal
bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows
State Mental Facility.”</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at
the age of 16.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Blah, blah, blah… it doesn’t say, but she was
released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the
arm-less wonder. Says she, “criss-crossed the United States constantly
in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.”</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: These dates perfectly correspond with the
time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I’ll bet
he amputated her arms.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know, I just thought it was
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: You know what Jerry, who really cares at
this point?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t… …I just thought it was weird.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let
him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That stupid hillbilly slut.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, don’t blow everything out of
proportion.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You didn’t see the look she threw me. She’s up
to something.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked
shit to us.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: When you were outside with Bill.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She said we look like pussy lickers or some
shit like that.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, she said we looked queer.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Aw, get over it, she’s just some dopey
redneck, she ain’t smart enough to be up to nothing… I mean anything…
chicks.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: These are all my dolls. I use to like to chop
their heads off.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: The door’s locked. I’ll gotta go around… wait
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Christ, you scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Aw, you ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is your brother ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh… yeah, he already left. We’ll wait inside,
come on.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He left!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, come on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I don’t know… about half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: What? I didn’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wait… quiet. Turn off the radio.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Now… listen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Shhhhhh, quiet.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I still don’t.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Turn on the headlights. See if anything is
out there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What… what!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Lock the doors… quick, quick.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It’s
the tow truck guy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think I’m gonna have a fucking heart
attack.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: OK lassies, I think it’s time you get to
gripping reality.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Enough with the stupid voices.</p>
<p><strong>gloria stuart</strong>: Knock again louder.</p>
<p><strong>melvyn douglas</strong>: I should of thought that was loud
enough to wake the dead… that’s an idea.</p>
<p><strong>raymond massey</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>melvyn douglas</strong>: Wouldn’t it be dramatic, supposing
the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly
burning about them.</p>
<p><strong>gloria stuart</strong>: I’m sure it would be very
amusing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So, you live here alone… I mean with just your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: No. There’s a bunch a us ‘round somewhere… I
think Mamma’s sleepin’. She sleeps a lot, now… do you want
marshmallows?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Um, yeah sure, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: You sure do a lot of guessing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, um… …what kind of animal is that?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: A dead one.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mmmmm, this is tasty.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: marshmallow with her</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of
late.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Don’t worry, sugar. It ain’t past my bedtime…
are you flirting with me?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What? No, I’m was worried that… I was just
wondering what’s taking so long.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed
everbody?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s not something to joke about.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: OK, sorry… maybe the Great Pumpkin ate ’em
up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, great they’re back.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Whoopie fucking doo.</p>
<p><strong>dr. wolfenstein</strong>: Aaaahooooh, the Doctor is in! Don’t
move, don’t scream. Stay tuned for more creature craziness from channel
68’s Halloween eve movie marathon. I’m your host… your ghost host with
the most, baby… Dr. Wolfenstein and will be with you until the end.
Aaaaaaahooooooh!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother
almost scared us to death.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Dude, your chick’s a little high strung.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mary, I’m sorry but he left without me. Mary…
come on, you don’t think I’d leave you stranded out there.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell him we’re
gonna be late. Can I use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Excuse me, may I please use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bill, why don’t you ask her… she’s your
special friend.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ain’t got one.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Huh? Oh, hi. You really don’t have a
phone?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, none. I had one once, back in ’57 maybe…
I don’t know. Really ain’t nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around
here no more.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could
drive us to a phone.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all
call him R.J.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What do they call you, sweety?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Um, I’m Jerry… that’s Bill… Denise and
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car
to the nearest garage.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I mean obviously we will compensate you for
your troubles.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, you ain’t no troubles, no, no, no fuss.
Baby… go see what Rufus Jr. is doing with these nice folks’
automobile.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: In the meanwhile please make yourselves at
home.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: 98 bodies in your bed, Some are green,
some are red. Eat the flesh and pick the bones, Drink the blood when you
get home. 99 bodies in the ground, Some are blue, some are brown. Gather
’round the people said, Where do you go when you are dead?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So, what brings you kids way out here, ain’t
you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here
in the sticks?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, I thought I’d maybe take in a
hoedown.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, really… …well, I’m a pretty good dancer
if you know what I mean… I bet I got a few moves you ain’t never
seen.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: No, he’s just joking. We don’t really have
any plans other than spending the night at my Dad’s house… …which is
where we were headed when our car broke down.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, I guess I’ll just help him hand out
candy to the trick or treaters.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And I’m gonna help put the razor blades in
the candy apples.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ll bet you are… you are a naughty little
thing aren’t ya.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I was just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, I get it… I guess you think you’re too
good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, just a little too old.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh really, well I hope something changes
your mind some day.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Tiny’s home.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What about R.J.?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh, he was already gone before I seen him… but
Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new
wheel.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The yard, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s an old auto junkyard out in
Baldwin.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: How long is that gonna take?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He should be back in a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A couple hours!</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Can’t Tiny drive us to a phone?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Tiny ain’t got no car, he ain’t even got a
bicycle.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: How’s he get around out here?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: He walks, duh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Fucking great.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I know you’re my guests and welcome but I’d
please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, even though I know it seems childish
to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all
invited to stay for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re a strange one, aren’t ya honey. I
think you and me are get on like… …like something real good.</p>
<p><strong>dr. wolfenstein</strong>: There well, who knew there was love
to be found in The Old Dark House. Coming up next, do not move a muscle,
an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic… are you
ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I hope to Christ she doesn’t expect us to wear
these things.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Whatever it is just do it. The more we play
along the faster we’ll get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Really, now is not the time to make
waves.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, I’m just waiting for Cousin Itt to show
up.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Shhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: You sure you don’t need any help in
there?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No dear, I’m fine. Now what kind of host
would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Ma, Tiny’s in.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Go tell him to get your Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Ma, I can’t, I’m busy getting dressed.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’ll have to forgive Tiny, he can’t hear
so much.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yeah, my poor baby. It’s his Daddy’s fault.
I mean Earl was a good man… I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one
day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: What happened? Oh, I’m sorry, it’s none of
my business.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He tried to burn the house down, said it was
possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the
fire started. I don’t think Earl ever meant to harm us… but Tiny was
badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Is that why he wears the mask?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around new
people, but he’ll warm up to ya… especially the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction
between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Maybe. He’s a real lady killer.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Didn’t ya think, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, we’ll see… the night is young and so
are you… oh well, couple more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Don’t be such a fucking smart ass.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, it’s really your fault that we’re stuck
in this shithole in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, don’t worry she didn’t get offended by
what I said. You two got to lighten up… right, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Whatever, at this point all I care about is
food. I’m starving and I got a fucking killer headache.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, I asked you if you wanted some
chicken.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Didn’t look like chicken to me, more like
fried pussy cat.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Tasted pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: God damn it, I can do it. I can do it
myself, ya big monkey. I ain’t dead yet… so don’t you and your sister
start counting out my money yet.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: God damn, my dogs are barking.</p>
<p><strong>bela lugosi</strong>: Your hands, please. Your left hand
shows your past…</p>
<p><strong>bela lugosi</strong>: …and your right hand shows your
future.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Hello, Denise?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Oh, yeah… no, Fred. I was hoping you

slowed ’em down… yeah… uh-huh, yeah… no, no you can keep it ’til
Tuesday… alright, talk to ya tomorrow, bye.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: OK, everyone, put on your masks. We can’t
very well eat with our everyday faces exposed.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Christ kid, put it on. She ain’t letting any
of us touch the grub ’til you’re wearing the damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve been meaning to ask you, Mrs… Ummmm.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Firefly.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Firefly… mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you
know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, I’m not much for local gossip an this
and that, but I’ve heard it mentioned in passing over the years but… I
mean folks is queer and they say things, crazy things you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: It’s all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of
hungry chipmunks… Christ, Dr. Satan. That takes the bull’s nuts alright…
…hey, I hear some genius up north got a hot line on the Easter Bunny for
ya.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I know all about what you want to know
about.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Otis! I can’t believe you decided to come
down and join us… and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special
night… all my babies together.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Now, I don’t know where you heard all your
little fairy fables about Dr. Satan but…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: From a Captain Spaulding down at some
museum.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: That old bitch hog don’t know shit. He tells
cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don’t sell no Yankee
boys no truth.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: But something happened, right? I mean the
story is based on a real incident, right?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter for
the Daily Asshole?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Grampa… watch the language.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I ain’t sure that you really need to know.
It’s better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I really want to know.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten
him.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Boy, I bet you’d stick your head in the fire
if I told ya you’d see Hell… meanwhile you too stupid to realize you got
a demon sticking out your ass singing, “Holy Miss Moly, I got a live
one.”</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Can we please change the subject?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Dinner’s over. Ladies and Germs… it’s
showtime.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s he so excited about?</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Yeah, showtime for what?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: For the show. It’s Halloween eve and time

<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, you mean on TV.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, no, no it’s so much more special than

something you’ll really love.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Please, come in… how many in your party…
…one, two, three and four… right this way.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Please be seated.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This is way too fucked up for words.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know the words… fucking psycho fucking
bullshit, that’s the words.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just grin and bear it.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: That food… ugh, I feel like I’m gonna
puke.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, ya can’t complain I never take you
anyplace.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can’t believe what I’m seeing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I know, this is fucking nuts.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is starting to make me real
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just sit back and enjoy the show.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, straight from his
smash six week sold out run at Tiki-Ti Club… the Stardust lounge is
proud to present Mr. Sexy himself… Grampa Hugo.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Hey, let me tell ya a story… so I’m hanging
out with my buddy Hal Jackowictz and I’m like, hey Hal let’s go get some
booze and chase the chickens… fucking Hal says no, no the old battle axe
at home will break my balls… I gotta get my ass home.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: So, I tell ’im… Hal, here’s the secret. Go
home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife’s
pussy… I mean jam your face right in the bush.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know, I think he’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: This isn’t funny, it’s twisted.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping
and licking away at her pussy, she’s screaming and howling… totally
passes out from the experience.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Dear God, let this end.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Now, Hal… He’s feeling pretty good, so he
goes into the bathroom for a quick shave… …suddenly he lets out a
horrible scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Sitting there on the toilet is Hal’s wife
Gloria… and she says, “Quiet down, you’ll wake Grandma!”</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Thank you, you’re too kind, too kind… stay
in your seats, coming up next we got something special for you men out
there.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Shit, I’m all for being a sport, but this is
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Man, it’s already ten thirty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m with Denise, can’t we just walk to
someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks
we could walk for hours and find zero.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, I’d say at this point all we can do is
just wait it out. There’s nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: I suppose. I mean they’re obviously all
bonkers, but I guess they’re harmless.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I fucking hope so.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: You gotta be kidding me. This chick is
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How much is a person supposed to stand?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: to keep her voice</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing
your viewing pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck
whore!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: You shouldn’t a done that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why? You gonna do something about it?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, I’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I’ll cut your fucking tits off and shove ’em
down your throat.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Baby! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Come on, ma… this bitch’s got it coming.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, I told you…</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Car’s done.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I suggest you kids leave now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t look back, just get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Lock the fucking doors.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Almost there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course she was gonna cut me, she’s a
fucking nut… I knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: You’re in Hell, bitch! You’re gonna die like a
dog!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I gotta open the gate.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Drive through it!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Holy fuck, hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bill! Help him!</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Hi. Lieutenant Broekman please… Donald
Willis.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Hey, Phil… Yeah, I’m alright… but I need
you to check on something for me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: I’m a little worried about Denise. She
called me last night from the road, out by Ruggsville at some joint
called Spaulding’s or something like that, said she’d be here about
eleven… but she never showed up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Yeah, if you could run a check on up
that way and see about any accidents or road closing or anything, I’d
really appreciate it… …yeah, yeah, I know… I’m sure nothing happened
but, you know me I like to worry… thanks… bye.</p>

<p><strong>otis</strong>: Yeah, I’ll bet you did. Scooping ice cream to
your shitheel friends on summer break… well, I ain’t talking about white
socks with Mickey Mouse on one side and Donald Duck on the other… shit,

<p><strong>otis</strong>: This is blood and guts, Suzy Q. Our bodies
come and go, but this blood is forever… …let me read you something,
listen and learn… you listening?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: And the angels, all pallid and wan, Uprising,
unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy “Man” And its hero the
Conqueror Worm… …you get that? Art is eternal, you get me, mamma?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Now, I’m gonna remove my hand… you make a
sound and I swear I’ll slit you open and make you eat your own fucking
intestines… you get me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why? Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady
there are some bigger issues at hand… than your fucking have a nice
fucking day bumper sticker shit!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where’s Bill?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Well, Bill… he’s a good guy, he’s been great

specimen. I mean you don’t know what a dry spell I’ve had, total block…
…total block… but Bill he’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Let’s go see.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bill? No, no, no! What have you done?
Bill!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Behold… The Fish-Boy!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This can’t be real, this can’t be real, this
can’t be real.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Oh, it’s real… as real as I want it to be,
mamma… …look, see the magic in my brush strokes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Fuck you, you fucking freak!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Oh, come now… we’re all creatures of God and
freaks in our own way… …but if you’ll notice… right here, needs a little
something, heh?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What are you doing? …no, stop… please,
please.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become
immortalized.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Noooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Well, let’s go see if the nut that runs this
place can help us.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Get a load of all this crap… this is one sick
place.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Whoever’s a jerking off on that
bell better be gone when I get out there… ’cause I’m gonna rip your nuts
off.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Officers, officers what can I do
for you today? I ain’t fried up the birds yet… if that’s what you’re
ring a ding dinging about.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: What I need are some answers.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Well, I’ll try but I don’t know
nothing ’bout nobody. I’m a guy who likes to mind his own business, if
ya get what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: You seen this girl? Say… within the last 24
hours.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yeah, yeah I seen her. Good looking
kid, but not really my type… …I like meaty, eh?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Hey ass clown, how ’bout some answers. He
ain’t interested in your love life.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Come on, get with the facts.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Hmmmmmmmmm?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: What’d you see, who was she with, where were
they going?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Aw, she was with some nosey,
smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around… asking stupid
questions.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Questions about what?</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: This and that, mostly some tired
Dr. Satan bullshit… they got a gander at the display back there and
thought they could solve the great Deadwoods mystery.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: And I gave ’em directions out
there, up by the old farm row… I figured what’s the harm. Stupid kids
probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around
backasswards and got lost as shit.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Is that all… think real hard.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yeah, they weren’t here but a few
minutes, didn’t really have time to get as up close and personal as I do
with most of the assholes that wander through here.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: How’s about you give me those same
directions.</p>
<p><strong>capt. spaulding</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sure. You don’t have to
get all True Grit all over my ass… I’ll give’m to ya… you can knock
yourself silly for all I care.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Enough talk, write.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: We’re gonna have fun tonight, bro.</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Yeah, fun.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally
stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting
shitfaced.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I hope you’re right, but my guts are telling
me different.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Your Spidey senses tingling.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Yeah… …huh, what the hell are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses…
like Spider-man… …you know, like in the comics.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: How old do you think I am? I know who the
fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: You know, his senses start tingling… when he
was approaching danger and shit.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I always favored the Hulk.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Hulk was dumb as shit.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Aw, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Plates match.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Call the chief… We found ’em.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: You all having a Halloween party
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Now, what makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: You all sure are buying a lot of holy water
for two people.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do
fucked up shit, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Yeah, yeah… …I like to fuck shit up.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I’ll bet you do… how much we owe ya…
…Goober?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Actually it’s G. Ober… Gerry Ober, but the
guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Great story Goober, how much?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Ummmm… two hundred and eighty-five
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Keep the change and get yourself a new
name.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Holy crap, thanks!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Come on, bro. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Hey, wait take this.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: A missing girl. I use’ta go to school with
her, she just up and disappeared some day… real weird.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Now isn’t she a happy little cherub… oh well
…nobody just up and disappears.</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Aliens.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: What’d we here, Georgie?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: A vehicle registered to a William S.
Hudley.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field
day beating the shit outta this thing.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Yeah, no mercy here.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: Recover any bodies?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring
this much hell down on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Just in the wrong place at the wrong
time.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: That’s the understatement of the year.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Yep, I suppose it is.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Hey, I found something.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: What’d ya got there?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Keys.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: Well Christ boy, don’t stand there like a
prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: Open up the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Toss ’em over here.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: God damn.</p>
<p><strong>huston</strong>: You find something, Georgie?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Yep, I found something.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Please… Tiny, please. Let me go… help
me.</p>
<p><strong>denise</strong>: Please, God please.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: You sure this guy’s supposed to ride with us?
Seems kind of weird.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Chief said pick him up and take him with us
on our house to house. Guy’s an ex-cop, thinks he can help.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just
get in the way.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Yeah, well I guess it’s tough to sit on the
sidelines and wait when your own kid’s missing… besides, ain’t no such
thing as an ex-cop.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: That must be him.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Mr. Willis?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I’m Wydell… this is Naish.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: George Willis… …any leads?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Well, we were on our way out to run a check
on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town… closest thing we got to
a lead at this point.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Well, all we know is the kids were headed
out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some
local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Dr. Satan?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Yeah it’s horseshit, just some boogieman crap
that the kids like to scare each other with.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Anyway, there’s not much else out that way…
so, I figure maybe there’s a chance the kids broke down and found their
way over to one of the farms.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: What about the body you found?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that’s
a strange one.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a
couple months, figured for a runaway.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Fit the profile?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: No, not really. Good kid, never been in any
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Her part in this I can’t figure… but I
will.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Christ, you know it’s crazy… I lived
through so many other people’s nightmares, you know. Always cool and
calm, but… but I never thought I’d be the one needing help, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Let’s hit the road, sooner we get a move on
sooner we’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: God damn bitch, what the fuck are you
waiting for… Charles Nelson Reilly don’t know shit…</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Watch that bitch, she’s thinking about that
Klugman bangin’ Brett Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: He’s the fucking slick jack Match Game man,
mamma.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Where do they find these people?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Christ, four kids couldn’t just
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: No they couldn’t, somebody had to see
something.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn’t
do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good
kid.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I’m sure there’s a logical explanation.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: I pray to God there is.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Turn up this road.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Where we headed?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I seem to remember another farm set way back
off the road where the car was found. I’m not sure if anyone lives there
anymore, but it’s worth a look.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I’m gonna see if anybody’s home. You and
Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Right… …come on.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Otis! Otis! Come quick, there’s cops
outside.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: What! God damn, how many?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: What? How many?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I don’t know. I only saw one.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m sure there’s more than that… fucking pigs
always travel in packs… …here, take this.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Go down stairs and play nice… I’m a gonna go
’round back and handle things like I always fucking do.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Shit, don’t these packrat hillbillies throw
anything away?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Shhhh… you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Yeah, I hear it… where’s it coming from?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Over here, inside the smokehouse.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Anybody in there?</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: We gotta break it open.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: I ain’t got a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Tell it to my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Shit… fuck procedure.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well hello, officer.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Excuse me, I’m sorry for disturbing you this
fine afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Aw, you ain’t disturbing me, but it kind of
looks like rain, don’t ya think?</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: My name is Lt. Wydell, I’d like to ask you a
few questions.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Questions? Well, heck, I’ll tell you
anything you want to know.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: I appreciate your cooperation. I’m looking
for a missing girl… …this girl here, Denise Willis… have you seen
her?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, I… mmmmm… no, I ain’t seen her,
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Please, could I please come in and talk to
you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture…
might stir up something.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I um… no, I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Please, just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, alright… I guess I can trust you… being
a man of the law and all.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, you are very welcome… Lord knows how I
love a man in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>naish</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Call Wydell.</p>
<p><strong>wydell</strong>: Think… do any of these kids look familiar in
any way?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, I can’t say that I ever seen ’em before…

<p><strong>mr. willis</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Hands up, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Turn around, real slow… piggy-pie.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Interlock your fingers behind your head… …do
it!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Kneel.</p>
<p><strong>dr. wolfenstein</strong>: It is midnight my little boils and
ghouls, the witching hour. Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and
madmen to go to work… so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back
and prepare for a fright night classic… …The House of Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Get those motherfucker… those high water
bitches and rocketship daisies… kill ’em, kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Show me, show me, show me, show me!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Drink up, it’s party time.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Enjoy your last night… …where’s Otis?</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh, he’s coming, he got something real special
this year.</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Quiet, quiet, you know he won’t come down
with all this hoop-dee-doo bouncing off the walls. Now, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: I shot an elephant in my pajamas this
morning… how he got in my pajamas I’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Grampa, shhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Then we tried to remove the tusks, but they
were embedded in so firmly that we couldn’t budge ’em.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Let him finish.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but
that’s entirely irrelephant.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m the one who brings the Christmas candy…
now tell me …Who’s your Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m the one who brings the devil’s brandy…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Who’s your Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Yes! I’m the one who beats you when you’re
bad…</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Who’s your Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Who’s your Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m the one who loves you when you’re fucking
dead!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Now, I say my little darlings… maybe prancing
around where you don’t belong ain’t such a winner of an idea…</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: And you, the great rusher of fools, what were
you after… Huh, speak to me… Oh, that’s right, Dr. Satan… everybody got
to know about Dr. Satan, Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest for fuck
sake, he’s already got one foot in the grave and the other’s tap dancing
around the edge… …well, I can see the disappointment on your sad little
puppy face… so I’m gonna do you a favor, a big, big favor. You owe me,
boy. I’m gonna let you meet the old bastard.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: That’s a horse’s ass alright, I told
you.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Baby, roll that old love machine over here, so
this boy can meet his hero.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: You see it’s all true, the boogieman is real
and you found him… …why so sad? Isn’t this what you begged for? There he
is, the living legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan. Now, don’t get shy on
me… ask your hero some questions, don’t blow this last in a lifetime
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the air,
the earth… the universe.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Look at the way he lights up… Grampa just
loves meeting his fans.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Aw gee whiz, I’m so excited… I really think
you’re the coolest… you’re tops on the playground, cooler than the
Fonzie.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Oh, oh pick me, pick me… I have a
question.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do you like to
kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: What the fuck are you saying? Who the hell
is talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Come on, my babies are getting restless.</p>
<p><strong>rufus jr.</strong>: Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in
the pit.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Alright, alright. Cut ’em down, it’s time they
get what they came here for.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Hold this. Point it over here.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Take his gag out, it’s more fun with the
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yeah, I like the screaming too… it’s so much
more exciting.</p>
