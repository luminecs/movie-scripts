<h1 id="happy-birthday-wanda-june">happy-birthday,-wanda-june</h1>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How do you do. My name is Penelope Ryan.
This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing–and those who
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I am Harold Ryan, her husband. I have killed
perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts–as a professional
soldier. I have killed thousands of other animals as well–for sport.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I am Dr. Norbert Woodly–a physician, a
healer. I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a
respected member of society. Gentleness must replace violence
everywhere, or we are doomed.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Would you like to say something about
killing, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Jesus–I dunno. You know. What the heck.
Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an
atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four
thousand people in a flash.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno, boy.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: It was a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Thank you. You can leave now. We’ll
begin.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Peace!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This is a tragedy. When it’s done, my face
will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro. My husband, who kills so
much, has been missing for eight years. He disappeared in a light plane
over the Amazon Rain Forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as
cantaloupes. His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the
bomb on Nagasaki. I should explain the doorbells in this apartment. They
were built by Abercrombie and Fitch. They are actual recordings of
animal cries. The back doorbell is a hyena, which you’ve just heard. The
front doorbell is a lion’s roar. Would you let them hear it please?
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And this is my son, Paul. He was only four
years old when his father disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s coming back, Mom! He’s the bravest, most
wonderful man who ever lived.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I told you this was a simple-minded
play.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe he’ll come back tonight! It’s his
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stay home tonight!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Oh, Paul–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re married! You’ve already got a
husband!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s a ghost!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you have to go out with some guy–can’t he
be more like Dad? Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly– can’t you do better
than those two freaks?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Thank you, kind sir.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A what kind of doctor?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A fairy–a queer. Everybody in the building
knows he’s a queer.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s an interesting piece of news.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re the only woman he ever took out.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Not true.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Still lives with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You know she has no feet! You want him to
abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who
has no feet?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How did she lose her feet?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: In a railroad accident many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was afraid to ask.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Norbert was just beginning practice. A
real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose. As far as
that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A lot of people don’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is
playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign. Peace. Peace.
Peace, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I hate that thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: clothes, carrying a rolled-up poster</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re taking Mom out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re going out?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Take plenty of cigars.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We made the date three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I must take you to an emergency ward
sometime–on a Saturday night. That’s also fun. I came to see Selma, as a
matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: She quit this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We don’t have a maid any more.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The animals made her sneeze and cry too
much.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m glad somebody finally cried. Every time
I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry. I
don’t cry, of course. Not manly, you know. Did she try
antihistamines?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: They made her so sleepy she couldn’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room
crawls with tropical disease.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Everything stays as it is!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: A monument to a man who thought that what
the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My father!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I apologize. But you didn’t know him, and
neither did I. How’s your asthma?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: How’s the fungus around your thumbnail?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s jungle rot! This room is making
everybody sick! This is your family doctor speaking now. Here–I brought
you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: “War is not healthy for children and other
living things.” How lovely.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I hate that thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Keeps fairies away!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: affectionately,</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m glad you brought your vacuum
cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: That maid just quit. The place is a mess.
You can start in the master bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Please–</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He’s not anybody to tell somebody else what
to do in a master bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’ll get ready, Herb. I didn’t expect you
this soon. Please–won’t everybody be nice to everybody else while I’m
gone?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Most men shunned me–even when I nearly
swooned for want of love. I might as well have been girdled in a
chastity belt. My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and
chickenwire, but of Harold’s lethal reputation.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I keep having this nightmare–that he
catches us.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He’d kill me. He’d be right to kill me,
too–the kind of guy he is.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Or was. We haven’t done anything wrong,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He’d assume we had.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s something I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: All through the day I’m so confident.
That’s why I’m such a good salesman, you know? I have confidence, and I
look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.
People laugh sometimes when they find out I’m a vacuum cleaner salesman.
They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three
thousand dollars last year. I’ve got six other salesmen working under
me, and what they all plug into is my confidence. That’s what charges
them up.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I was captain of the wrestling team at
Lehigh University.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh. If
you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t want to go to Vanderbilt.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You don’t wrestle if you don’t have supreme
confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to
myself, “My God–here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great
heroes of all time–”</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Something happens to my confidence.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This conversation took place,
incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally
dead.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: When Harold is definitely out of the
picture, Penelope, when I don’t have to worry about doing him wrong or
you wrong or Paul wrong. I’m going to ask you to be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m touched.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: That’s when I’ll get my confidence
back.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: If you’ll pardon the expression, that’s
when you’ll see the fur and feathers fly. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You’ve got to fight from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Not true.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Or get eaten alive.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: That’s not true either–or needn’t be, unless
we make it true.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Phooey.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Which we do. But we can stop doing that.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: We simply stop doing that–dropping things on
each other, eating each other alive.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Penelope! We’re late!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Women are always late. You’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I’m sick of this argument. I just have one
more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter
what he does. That’s the only way you can have a country!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s the planet that’s in ghastly trouble
now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: None of my relatives are Chinese
Communists. Speak for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and
American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this
lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device. Let a
radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and
that’s the end of mankind.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You can believe that if you want. I talk to
guys like you, and I want to commit suicide. You get that weight-lifting
set I sent you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It came yesterday. I haven’t opened it
yet.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: to find the idea acceptable, even</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Start with the smallest weights. Every week
add a pound or two.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived
be reborn–so he or she can see how it ends. Even Pithecanthropus erectus
and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers
are back on Earth–to see how it ends. They’re all on Times Square–making
change for peepshows. Or recruiting Marines.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You ever hear the story about the boy who
carried a calf around the barn every day?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: He died of a massive rupture.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You think you’re so funny. You’re not even
funny. Right? Right? You don’t hurt yourself if you start out slow.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re preparing him for a career in the
slaughterhouses of Dubuque? Take care of your body, yes! But don’t
become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes. Don’t become obsessed
by your musculature. Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a
thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in
their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Gentlemen! Is this right for a fight? It’s
been so long.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Beautiful! I’ve never seen that coat.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Seven jaguars’ skins, I’m told. Harold
shot every one. Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Oh no! Wear a coat of cotton–wear a coat of
wool.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Wear a coat of domestic mink. For the love
of God, though, Penelope, don’t lightheartedly advertise that the last
of the jaguars died for you.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: She’s my date tonight. What do you want her
to do–bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?
Bugger off! Ask Paul what he thinks. Your mother looks beautiful–right?
Kid? Doesn’t your mother look nice? Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t care what she wears.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Something’s made you sore.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You bet I’ll worry about it. I said
something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s my father’s birthday–that’s all. That’s
all. Who cares about that?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I had not the slightest inkling. Why didn’t
you say so?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She doesn’t care! She’s not married any more!
She’s going to have fun! I hope you have so much fun you can hardly
stand it. Dr. Woodly–I hope you make up even better jokes about my
father than the ones you’ve said so far.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Kid–kid–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And I wish you’d quit touching me all the
time. It drives me nuts!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You sure misunderstood something– and we’d
better get it straight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Explain it to them. I’m bugging out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t touch me. Get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Men can touch other men, and it doesn’t
mean a thing. Haven’t you ever seen football players after they’ve won
the Superbowl?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Where will you be?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anywhere but here. I’d just sit here and cry
about the way my father’s been forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I worship your father. That stuffed
alligator your mother gave me–the one he shot? It’s the proudest thing
in my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.
Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Kid–kid–</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s good. Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: If he’d just come out for the Little
League, the way I asked him, he’d find out we touch all the time–shove
each other, slug each other, and just horse around. I’m going to go get
him–</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Don’t! Let him have all the privacy he
wants. Let him grieve, let him rage. There has never been a funeral for
his father.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I never knew when to hold it–or who to
ask, or what to say.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Tonight’s the night.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: If he’d just get into scouting, and camp
out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire–</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: What a beautiful demonstration this is of
the utter necessity of rites of passage.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I feel like I’ve been double- crossed. If
you’d just told me it was Harold’s birthday–</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: We could have had some kind of birthday
party for him. We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Minors aren’t allowed at fights.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Then we’d stay home and eat venison or
something, and look through the scrapbooks. I’ve got a friend who has a
whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat. I’m going to bring
that boy back.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: This is very good for us.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he’ll
be tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: As long as he keeps out of the park.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: After this explosion, I think, he’ll be able
to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The only thing I ever told him about life
was, “Keep out of the park after the sun goes down.”</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: We’ve got to dump Shuttle. He brings his
vacuum cleaner on dates?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s the XKE.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s an experimental model. He doesn’t
dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of
competition.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: What kind of a life is that?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He told me one time what the proudest
moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine
years old. Oh, Norbert–promise me that Paul has not gone into the
park!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: If you warned him against it as much as you
say, it’s almost a certainty.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No! Oh no! Three people murdered in there
in the last six weeks! The police won’t even go in there any more.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I wish Paul luck.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s suicide!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’d be dead by now if that were the
case.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Every night, Penelope, for the past two
years, I’ve made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: To show myself how brave I am. The issue’s
in doubt, you know–since I’m always for peace–</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m amazed.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Me, too. I know something not even the
police know–what’s in the park at midnight. Nothing. Or, when I’m in
there, there’s me in there. Fear and nobody and me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And maybe Paul. What about the murderers?
They’re in there!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: They didn’t murder me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Paul’s only twelve years old.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: He can make the sound of human
footsteps–which is a terrifying sound.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We’ve got to rescue him.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: If he is in the park, luck is all that can
save him now, and there’s plenty of that.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s not your son.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No. But he’s going to be. If he is in the
park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, “You
and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at
midnight.” On that we can build.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s a jungle out there.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: That’s been said before.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’d go to a movie. I think that’s what
he’d do. If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying. We
could have him paged.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I hate that thing.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Is he coming home?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He ditched me. He started running, and I
started running, then he lost me in the park.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The park!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: It’s dark in there.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And that’s where he is!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I figure he ducked in one place and ducked
out another.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You figure!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Then I saw this bakery store that was still
open, so I bought a birthday cake.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: For Harold. When Paul comes home, we can
have some birthday cake.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How nice.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: They had this cake somebody else hadn’t
picked up. It says, “Happy Birthday, Somebody Else.”</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: “Happy Birthday, Wanda June!”</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: We can take off the “Wanda June” with a
butter knife.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Did you talk to Paul?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Before he started to run. He said his
father carried a key to this apartment around his neck–and someday we’d
all hear the sound of that key in the door.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We’ve got to find him. I want you to show
me exactly where you saw him last. And you stay here, Norbert, in case
he comes home. That’s all he said–the thing about the key?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He said one other thing. It wasn’t very
nice.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: He told me to take a flying fuck at the
moon.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Ooops.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ooops.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Can I–uh–help you gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Gentlemen–that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You startled me.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Yeah. We just got here.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I thought you might be burglars– but you’re
not, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Nope. I got a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The door ws unlocked. Is it always
unlocked?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s always locked.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But here you are inside, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re–you’re old friends of Harold
Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We tried to be. We tried to be.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: He’s dead, you know.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Dead! Such a final word. Dead! Did you hear
that?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Hello? Oh–hello, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hello, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: …Who?… Did she say how far apart the pains
were?… When was that?… Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Call her back–tell her to head for the
hospital. Tell the hospital to expect her. I’ll leave right now.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Look–I’m sorry–I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’ll miss you so.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Look–this isn’t my apartment, and there
isn’t anybody else here. Mrs. Ryan won’t be home for a while.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, oh, oh–I thought it was your apartment.
You seemed at home here.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m a neighbor. I have the apartment across
the hall. I have to go to the hospital now. An emergency.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I mean–I can’t leave you here. You’ll have
to go. I’ll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here. You can come back later.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ahh–then she’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: She’s fine. Please–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Will you please go? An emergency!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She still has just the one child– the
boy?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Yes! Yes! The boy! One boy!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And what, exactly, is your relationship to
Mrs. Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And you come into Mrs. Ryan’s apartment as
often as you please, looking into various health matters?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Yes! Please! You’ve got to get out right
now!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Just her neighbor and doctor? That’s
all?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: And her fianc�!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And her fianc�! How nice. I hope you’ll be
very happy–or is that what one says to the woman?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’ve got to run!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You wish the woman good luck, and you tell
the man how fortunate he is. That’s how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’ve literally got to run!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I won’t try to keep up with you. I’m not as
fast on my feet as I once was.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Miss me, baby?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno, boy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: It’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: A bitch.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Didn’t recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’ve never met.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I wonder who’ll recognize us first?
They’ll wet their pants.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I hope the men do. I would rather the women
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I’m gonna wet my pants.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Home, sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: One thing, anyway–at least Penelope
didn’t throw out all your crap. I bet Alice threw out all my crap after
I’d been gone a week.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It appears that we’re going to have to wait
awhile for any more action here, Colonel. Why don’t you run on home
while the evening’s young.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Home. Jesus. I’m like this. Home!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Home is important to a man.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: How all the magazines show tits
today.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Um.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Used to be against the law, didn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Must have changed that law.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: a broadsword, admiring its balance</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: How everybody says “fuck” and “shit” all
the time. I used to be scared shitless I’d say “fuck” or “shit” in
public, by accident. Now everybody says “fuck” and “shit,” “fuck” and
“shit” all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were
out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Looseleaf–will you get the hell home?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: At least we found the diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: At least!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I’d really feel stupid if we didn’t bring
anything back home.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s enough that you’ve brought yourself
home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I wish you’d tell Alice that. And that
Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tell them yourself!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You don’t know my mother-in-law, boy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: After eight years in the jungle with you, I
know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I didn’t tell you everything.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The time we were in a tree for fourteen
days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I didn’t even scratch the surface. You’re
lucky, boy. You come home, and nobody’s here. When I go home,
everybody’s going to be there.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This room is full of ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You’re lucky, boy. My house is gonna be
filled with people.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Thank God we found the fucking
diamonds!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The hell with the diamonds!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You were rich before. This is the first
time I was ever rich.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go home! Show them how rich you are for a
change!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Can I have the Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff,
for all I care.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: What’ll you do for transportation?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go
home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me about that
Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: When I drive it, I feel like I’m in the
middle of a great big wad of bubblegum. I don’t hear anything, I don’t
feel anything. I figure somebody else is driving. It’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I’m liable to find anything!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s the point! Walk in there and find
whatever there is to find–before Alice can cover it up.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I know, I know. I dunno. At least she’s
in the same house. Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and
there she was.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So long, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: LOOSELEAF and steering him to the</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: How short the skirts are.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Good night, Colonel. It’s been
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Something very important about sex must
have happened while we were gone.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hell!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know what gets me? Those guys who
went to the moon! To the moon, boy!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Leave me alone! After eight years of
horrendously close association, the time has come to part! I crave
solitude and time for reflection– and then a reunion in privacy with my
own flesh and blood. You and I may not meet again for months!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Months?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m certainly not going to come horning back
into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into
mine. A chapter has ended. We are old comrades–at a parting of the
ways.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I’m lonesome already.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The moon. The new heroism–put a village
idiot into a pressure cooker, seal it up tight, and shoot him at the
moon. Hello there, young man. In case you’re wondering, I could beat the
shit out of you. And any woman choosing between us–sorry, kid, she’d
choose me. I must say, this room is very much as I left it. What’s this?
A cake? “Happy Birthday, Wanda June”? Who the hell is Wanda June?</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Hello. I am Wanda June. Today was going
to be my birthday, but I was hit by an ice-cream truck before I could
have my party. I am dead now. I am in Heaven. That is why my parents did
not pick up the cake at the bakery. I am not mad at the ice-cream truck
driver, even though he was drunk when he hit me. It didn’t hurt much. It
wasn’t even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee. I am really happy here!
It’s so much fun. I am glad the driver was drunk. If he hadn’t been, I
might not have got to Heaven for years and years and years. I would have
had to go to high school first, and then beauty college. I would have
had to get married and have babies and everything. Now I can just play
and play and play. Any time I want any pink cotton candy I can have
some. Everybody up here is happy– the animals and the dead soldiers and
people who went to the electric chair and everything. They’re all glad
for whatever sent them here. Nobody is mad. We’re all too busy playing
shuffleboard. So if you think of killing somebody, don’t worry about it.
Just go ahead and do it. Whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing
it. The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the
bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the
time–and drink beer.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: We have merry-go-rounds that don’t cost
anything to ride on. We have Ferris wheels. We have Little League and
girls’ basketball. There’s a drum and bugle corps anybody can join. For
people who like golf, there is a par-three golf course and a driving
range, with never any waiting. If you just want to sit and loaf, why
that’s all right, too. Gourmet specialties are cooked to your order and
served at any time of night or day…</p>
<p><strong>woody woodpecker voice</strong>: Ha ha ha ha ha! You got me,
pal.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: When Penelope asked me to say something
about dropping the bomb on Nagasaki, I didn’t give a very good answer, I
guess. It’s a very complicated question. Jesus–you know? You have to
explain what it’s like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your
orders and all that. What it feels like to be in a plane, what the world
looks like down there. After I got home from the war, the minister of my
church asked me if I would speak to a scout troop that met in the church
basement. So I did. They met on Thursday nights. I used to belong to
that troop. I never made Eagle Scout. But you know something? It’s a
very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout. They always seem so
lonesome, like they’d worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares
about. They get a whole bunch of merit badges. That’s how you get to be
an Eagle Scout. I don’t think I had over five or six merit badges. The
only one I remember is Public Health. That was a bitch. The Boy Scout
Manual said I was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage.
Jesus, they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek. Sugar Creek! That was a
long time ago, but it’s all coming back to me now. There was another
merit badge you could get for roller skating. There used to be a roller
rink at a bend in Sugar Creek, up above where the sewage went in. I got
in a fight there one time. I had on roller skates, and the guy I was
fighting had on basketball shoes. He had a tremendous advantage over me.
He was a little guy, but he beat the shit out of me. I had to laugh like
hell. Don’t ever fight a guy when you’ve got on roller skates. Jesus–I
remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before
I swallowed–so I wouldn’t get sick. Makes you wonder what else your
parents told you that wasn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The night I met Penelope, I had no beard–so
imagine me, if you can, without a beard. Actually, I wasn’t as
good-looking then as I am now. And, if anything, me health has improved.
At any rate–I had just come home from Kenya–to discover that my third
wife, Mildred, like the two before her, had become a drunken bum. In my
experience, alcoholism is far more prevalent among women than men. So I
got into my automobile–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I drive through the night, until I was
attracted by a sign which said–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: “Hamburger Heaven.”</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I think so, daughter. How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Eighteen– and a half.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok–a
gazelle.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Raw hamburger, please–and a whole onion. I
want to eat the onion like an apple. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes, sir. It was a very unusual
automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the
bumpers should be. And what to drink?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What time do you get off work, my child?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, I’m engaged to be married.
My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Did you ever daydream that you would one day
meet a friendly millionaire?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m engaged.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Daughter–I love you very much.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You don’t even know me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You are woman. I know woman well.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Destiny often seems that way. You’re going
to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What do you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: My parents died in an automobile accident
when I was sixteen years old. They left me a brewery and a baseball
team–and other things. I live for a living. I’ve just come back from
Kenya–in Africa. I’ve been hunting Mau Mau there.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Some kind of animal?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The pelt is black. It’s a kind of man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mom? Herb? Dr. Woodly? Hello? A cake? Who’s
Wanda June?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: As a matter of fact–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: As a matter of fact–I am home.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You were about to ask a question?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you–do you–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ask it!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you know who Wanda June is?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Life has denied me that thrill.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you mind if I ask who you are?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mind? God, yes, I mind. I’m your father’s
friend. A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while
ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Woodly.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Dr. Woodly. I should make a little list.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is anybody besides you here now?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The doctor was called away on an emergency.
I think it was birth.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You don’t know where your mother is? Does
she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You think you could find me a pencil and
paper?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And you’ve been roaming the streets while
your mother is God-knows-where?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my
mind. If you’re depressed, laughing doesn’t help much. When did you know
my father?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Man and boy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Everybody says he was so brave.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Even this–“Herb Shuttle”, you said?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He worships Father.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ah! And what sort of man is this
worshiper?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s a vacuum cleaner salesman.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I see. And he came into the apartment one
day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was
charmingly en deshabille–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She met him at college.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: College!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They were in the same creative writing
class.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: College?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She has a master’s degree in English
literature.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What a pity! Educating a beautiful woman is
like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch. Everything stops. And the
doctor? He worships your father, too?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He insults him all the time.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s good about that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It makes life spicy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He doesn’t do it in front of me, but he does
it with Mother. You know what he called Father one time?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What does he do–of an athletic nature?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing. He plays a violin in a doctors’
quartet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Aha! He has a brilliant military record, I’m
sure.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.
Were you in a war with Father?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones–just
and otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell me some true stories about Dad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: “Dad?” Dad. The boy wants tales of
derring-do. Name a country.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: England?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh hell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dad was never in England?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Behind a desk for a little while. A desk!
They had him planning air raids. A city can’t flee like a coward or
fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the
core of the life of Harold Ryan. There was only one thing he enjoyed
more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the
choice himself. Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was a famous sniper. They called him “La
Picadura”–“the sting.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “The sting.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: As in “Death, where is thy sting?” He killed
at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “The sting.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted
into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band–in the war against the
Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von
Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell me that! Tell me that!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hid by day–fought by night. At sunset one
day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black
Mercedes draw up to a village inn. It was escorted by two motorcyclists
and an armored car. Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful
men in all of history–the Beast of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We blacked our hands and faces. At midnight
we crept out of the forest and into the village. The name of the village
was Mhravitch. Remember that name!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mhravitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We came up behind a sentry, and your father
slit his throat before he could utter a sound.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uck.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t care for cold steel? A knife is worse
than a bullet?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The story gets hairier. Should I stop?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We caught another Kraut alone in a back
lane. Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire. Your
father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire. That’s nicer than a knife,
isn’t it–as long as you don’t look at the face afterwards. The face
turns a curious shade of avocado. I must ask the doctor why that is. At
any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of
the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing
there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where did you get the poison?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We carried cyanide capsules. We were
supposed to swallow them in case we were captured. It was your father’s
opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And one of them was the Beast of
Yugoslavia?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The Beast was upstairs, and he came running
downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and
testaments–editorializing about the hospitality they had received. And
your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the
Spanish Civil War, “Major, something tragic seems to have happened to
your bodyguard. I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America. You,
I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.”</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Ja ja. Ja ja. I am Major Siegfried
von Konigswald. They used to call me “The Beast of Yugoslavia,” on
account of all the people I had tortured and shot–and hanged. We’d bop
’em on the head. We’d hook ’em up to the electricity. We’d stick ’em
with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff. One time we killed
a guy with orange juice. There was a train wreck, and two of the freight
cars were loaded with oranges, so we had oceans of orange juice. It was
a joke–how much orange juice we had. And we were interrogating a guy one
day, and he wouldn’t talk, and the next thing I know–somebody’s filling
up this big syringe with orange juice. There was a guerrilla war going
on. You couldn’t tell who was a guerrilla and who wasn’t. Even if you
got one, it was still a civilian you got. Telling Americans what a
guerrilla war is like–that’s coals to Newcastle. How do you like that
for idiomatic English? “Coals to Newcastle.” That Harold Ryan–he says he
spoke to me in perfect German? He talks German like my ass chews gum.
I’m glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me. I sure
didn’t understand it the first time around. I figured he was a
Lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you
can be. All I knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a
machine pistol, and it was aimed at me. The woods were full of all kinds
of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had
guns. They were always looking for revenge. You find a way to bottle
revenge–that’s the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola. Harold Ryan said he
killed maybe two hundred guys. I killed a hundred times that many, I
bet. That’s still peanuts, of course, compared to what that crazy
Looseleaf did. Harold and me–we was doing it the hard way. I hope the
record books will show that. There should be a little star or something
by the names of the guys who did it the hard way. I’m up in Heaven now,
like that little Wanda June kid. I wasn’t hit by no ice-cream truck.
Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands. He was good. My eyes popped
out. My tongue stuck out like a red banana. I shit in my pants. It was a
mess. When I got up on the day I died, I said, “What a beautiful day
this is. What a beautiful part of the world.” The whole planet was
beautiful. Up here I meet guys from other planets. We got some really
crazy-looking guys up here. Their planets weren’t anywhere near as nice
as Earth. They had clouds all the time. They never saw a clear blue sky.
They never saw snow. They never saw an ocean. They had some little
lakes, but you couldn’t go swimming in them. The lakes were acid. You go
swimming, you dissolve. We got some guys up here who got shoved in them
lakes. They dissolved. Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in
Yugoslavia. He switched to English, so I finally got some kind of idea
what he was so burned up about. He wanted revenge for the guy we killed
with orange juice. I don’t know how he ever found out about it. There
was just three of us there when we did it–me and two regular military
doctors. Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed. If I’d
lived through the war, and they tried me for war crimes and all that,
I’d have to tell the court, I guess, “I was only following orders, as a
good soldier should. Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange
juice.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mhravitch. Remember that name.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mhravitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The name will live forever. It was there
that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia. Mhravitch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When I grow up, I’m going to go to
Mhravitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s rather a disappointment these days. It
isn’t there any more.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The Germans shot everybody who lived there,
then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile
ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.
To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle
Scout. Play lots of contact sports?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was
afraid I’d get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re supposed to get hurt!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Woodly says he’s seen hundreds of children
permanently injured by football. He says that when there’s a war,
everybody goes but football players.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Does it bother you to have your mother
engaged to a man like that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re not engaged.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He seems to think they are. He told me that
were.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can’t be. How
embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re a very good boy to respond that
way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d like to use the sanitary facilities, if
I may.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go ahead. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: What a relief!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: My baby’s safe!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What’s the matter now?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see
the cake?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Who have you been talking to?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly
going to be my father now?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: That goes double for me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t want to live any more.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I feel like I want to yell my head off–just
yell anything. Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a
pansy next? This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I’m
concerned. You must be crazy as a fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: How long has this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A week. We were waiting for the right time
to–</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I feel as though I had been made a perfect
chump of.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Marry me instead.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Thank you, Herb. You’re a wonderful man.
You really are. Everybody respects you for what you’ve done for scouting
and the Little League.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You’re saying no.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m saying no–and thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I didn’t make my move fast enough. That’s
it, isn’t it? I was too respectful.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You were wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: What’s so wonderful if I lost the sale? You
poor kid.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Wouldn’t you rather have your mother marry
me than him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: All my dreams have suddenly collapsed. We
did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Well–it was nice while it lasted. Thanks
for the memories.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Is Norbert still here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Then who flushed the toilet?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Father’s friend.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: For Heaven’s sakes!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How do you do, Mrs. Ryan? I’d heard you were
beautiful, and so you are. Am I intruding here?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I couldn’t help overhearing that you were
about to get married again.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Our family physician has asked me to marry
him. Paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give.
He isn’t at all like Harold. But then again, I’m not the woman I was
eight years ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That man is your father.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: There stands the loins from which you’ve
sprung.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It is you, isn’t it, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes, wife, it is. Come here, boy. Your
father is home.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Go to him.</p>
<p><strong>harold paul</strong>: Son, son, son… Father, father,
father…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wife, wife, wife…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wife, wife, wife…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Give us time.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Like hugging a lamp post.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Give us time, Harold–to adjust to your
being alive.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You were well adjusted to my being dead?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We adjust to what there is to adjust to.
Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately. I
hope he can. I will take a little longer. I’ll be as quick as I can.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What sort of time period do you have in
mind? Half an hour? An hour?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t know. This is a new disease to
me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Disease?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Situation.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This reunion isn’t what I imagined it would
be.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A telegram–a phone call might have
helped.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Seemed the most honest way to begin life
together again–natural, unrehearsed.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Well–enjoy the natural, honest,
unrehearsed result–surgical shock.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You feel that you’re behaving as a woman
should?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Every fuse in my nervous system has been
blown.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Who’s that? Teddy Roosevelt?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Safe and sound, I see. Oh–you came back.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I came back.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You know each other?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: We met here earlier this evening.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How neat. How keen.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: A policeman delivered the baby in a
taxicab.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tough luck. You’ll have to split the
fee.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Are–are you crying, Penelope?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s crying because she’s so happy.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s why I’m crying.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Woodly? You know who this is?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I didn’t get his name. A friend of your
father?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He isn’t any friend of Father.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: He isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He is my father.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup. Dr. Woodly–I would like
you to meet Harold, my husband. Harold, this is Dr. Woodly, my
fianc�.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Good night, dear. Good night, dear.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Stay or go, talk or sulk, laugh or cry–as
you wish. Do whatever seems called for. My mind is gone. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I feel the same way. What next?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What next? You leave promptly, of course.
There is no question as to whose home this is–</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Whose son this is, whose wife that is. A
fianc� is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at
this time. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Penelope! God damn it! Penelope!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is Looseleaf Harper alive?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Alive and hale. He’s throwing a little
surprise party for his own family. Is your mother often this unstable?
Penelope!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s a real heavy sleeper sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why don’t you go to bed–son.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t take my eyes off you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tomorrow’s another day.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know what my English literature teacher
said about you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Can’t it keep till morning?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She said you were legendary. I wrote a theme
about you, and she said, “Your father is a legendary hero out of the
Golden Age of Heroes.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s nice. You thank her for me. Go to bed
and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tomorrow’s Saturday. Anyway, she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Penelope!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She was killed in the park two months ago–in
the daytime.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Penelope!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She was on her way home from a meeting of the
African Violet Society, and they got her.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Will you go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes sir. If you can’t wake Mom up, I’ve got
double-decker bunks.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Scat!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Penelope–darling–can you hear me? Wife–you
know what kept me alive all these fevered, swampy, nightmare years? Your
heavenly face, Penelope, my wife–shimmering before me, coaxing me up
from my knees, begging me to stagger one step closer to home. Has love
ever reached so far? Has love ever overcome more hardships than mine?
Has love ever asked more manliness of a man, more womanliness of a
woman? Has ever a man done more for a woman’s reward?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: There is no one in here of any earthly use
to anyone tonight. Tomorrow is another day.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: End of Act One.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mom! Mother! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dad’s got jungle fever, Mom. What’ll I do?
Mom!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: mechanically as a</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shivers and sweats and groans. His teeth
chatter. What’ll we do?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What does he say to do?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He can hardly talk.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Bluh.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’d better get Dr. Woodly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It is an emergency, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Then get him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Woodly?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Woodly?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s that all about?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We thought a doctor might help.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Your old beau?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We thought it was an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t want that chancre mechanic in
here.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s a very decent man, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We all are.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Shouldn’t you lie down?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: When I’m dead– or fucking.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Paul said you were awfully sick.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I was, I was. It never lasts long.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The Indians call it “Zamba- keetya”–the
little cloudburst.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Ah! You’re ambulatory!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What a brilliant diagnosis!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You know what I want? I want you both to
be friends. I know you both, respect you both. You should be
friends.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Nothing would please me more.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Well now–what seems to be the trouble with
the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I know malaria. Malaria isn’t caused by the
bites of bats.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’ve been bitten by bats?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop
with a family of bats. There was a flash flood. There were piranha fish
in the water. That’s how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You have chills?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Chills, fevers, sweats. You can describe it
and name it after yourself: “the Woodly galloping crud.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You can also describe its cure. I’m eating
its cure.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I was going to ask.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Pacqualinincheewa root.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Would you say that again?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Pacqualinincheewa root. Means “cougar fang.”
Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’ve never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Congratulations. By crossing twenty-eight
feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you’ve become the third white man
ever to hear of it.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Are you’ve seen it work cures?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hundreds.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m so glad you like each other. I was so
scared, so scared.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Have some.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I believe in miracles now.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wasn’t that sweet of me?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: More and more we find ourselves laying aside
false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.
Curare, ephedrine–we’ve found some amazing things.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We have, have we?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: That’s an editorial we, of course. I haven’t
turned up anything personally.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Everything about you is the editorial we.
Take that away from you, and you’d disappear.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I could carve a better man out of a
banana!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Please–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You and your damned bedside manner and your
damned little black bag full of miracles. You know who filled that bag
for you? Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself. Men with guts filled
it, by God–men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles–suffering,
ingratitude, loneliness, death–</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Good Lord.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I can just hear the editorial wee-
wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.
I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: “We discovered it in the
Amazon Rain Forest. Now we cure you with it. Now we lower our eyes with
becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, bless you, Doctor, bless you– oh healer,
oh protector, oh giver of life.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He doesn’t deserve this! You don’t know
him. It isn’t fair!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He thought he could take my place. It is now
my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don’t think he’s
man enough to do that.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I thought she was a widow.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You were wrong, you quack!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Awful. I can’t tell you how sorry I
am.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Say hello to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Do say hello to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m taking her to the airport a few minutes
from now. She’s going to East St. Louis–to visit an aunt.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Tell her to have a nice trip.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m going to have to report you to the
Department of Health.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering
from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Now that’s what I call fun.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’ll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings
again. You used to eat it up.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We were one hell of a pair–and we’ll be one
again. What we need is a honeymoon. Let’s start right now.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A trip, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I had a trip. We’ll honeymoon here. Go out
and play.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Play?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Your mother and I do not wish to be
disturbed for three full hours.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He hasn’t had breakfast yet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Buy yourself breakfast. There we go.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A hundred dollars!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The smallest thing I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can I get dressed first?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s so–so stark.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You used to like it stark!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Just–bang–we have a honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m not going to strike you. I am going to
be as gentle as pie–as lemon meringue pie. You mustn’t run away now.
This is your loving husband approaching. I’m your husband. Society
approves!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Good! You held your ground.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Now–turn around, if you would.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Turn around?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m not about to introduce to you a jungle
novelty. What I have in mind is massage–a perfectly decent massage. Turn
around, turn around.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m going to touch your shoulders very
gently now. You mustn’t scream. So tense, so tense.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You shouldn’t have talked to Norbert that
way.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re thinking with your brain instead of
your body. That’s why you’re so tense! Forget Norbert. Relax. It’s body
time.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I have a brain.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We all do. But now it’s body time. Relax.
Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled
with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain
rods. Think of your muscles one by one. Let them go slack. Relax. Let
the brain go blank. Relax. That’s the idea– that’s my girl. Now the
small of the back. Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dad–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: PENELOPE, but knowing</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A hundred dollars for breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Leave a tip.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: away, having been</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ram it up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I do beg your pardon. Those words were illy
chosen. There is tension in all of us here. Something you must both
understand, however, is that the head of this household is home, and he
is Harold Ryan, and people do what he says when he says it. That’s the
way this particular clock is constructed.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sometimes even I hate that thing.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I’ve been looking at motorcycles.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You ever own a motorcycle?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re right! We’ll take a trip. A trip is
what we’ll take. I don’t want to talk about motorcycles. I don’t want to
talk about tits. Go home!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Haven’t got one.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And you went home unannounced, too?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And how were things?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Let’s talk about something else.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Alice got married again.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You didn’t even find that out?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: There was so much going on.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: She married an accountant named Stanley
Kestenbaum.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: So that’s it! “Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum.”
Everybody was yelling “Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum.” I thought it was some
foreign language.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Otherwise, how are things?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I sure didn’t expect her to drop
dead.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Dead!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Alice is dead?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: No, no–shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: For saying “shit.” Or is that okay
now?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Who’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: My mother-in-law. Fire engines,
pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners–</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Well–I walked up to the front door. I was
still alive. Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler
answered. She had her Goddamn knitting. I said, “Guess who?” She conked
right out.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How horrible.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Yeah–cripes. I never did get any sense
out of Alice. She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.
It was a bitch. You know–maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and
there anyway, even if I’d been the paper boy. Maybe not. I dunno, boy.
That’s civilian life for you. Who knows what kills anybody?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Could have happened to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: First Nagasaki–now this.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How about breakfast, wife?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried
potatoes–and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple. Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And lots of orange juice–oceans of orange
juice.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Mrs. Wheeler is dead.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: All right–bring me a side order of
Mrs. Wheeler. Oh, hell–sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some
chow.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That is the most heartless statement I
ever heard pass between human lips.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: “Bring me a side order of
Mrs. Wheeler.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s up in Heaven now. She didn’t hear. She
is experiencing nothing but pure happiness. There’s nothing nicer than
that. Chow! Harold Ryan wants chow!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What a honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Honeymoon temporarily canceled. The boy
should still go out and exercise. I have the impression he never gets
any exercise. He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his
brains over steam radiators.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Then let me see him go out and get some
exercise. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What kind of exercise?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Beat the shit out of someone who hates
you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Chow, chow, chow! God damn it–
nutriment!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We’re all going to have to go out for
breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re a woman, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Then we have a cook.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Cook, by God! Cook! You’re the nigger
now.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: People don’t use that word any more.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t lecture me on race relations. I don’t
have a molecule of prejudice. I’ve been in battle with every kind of man
there is. I’ve been in bed with every kind of woman there is–from a
Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I’d ever been to the South Pole,
there’d be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me. Cook!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You leave me so–so without– without
dignity.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: People now have dignity when frying
eggs?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: They don’t have to feel like slaves.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Then go now–and fry with dignity– sunnyside
up.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno, boy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The educational process.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I guess. You’re lucky you don’t have any
old people around here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She was about to get married again. She
locked me out of the bedroom last night.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s funny about that?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You know me, boy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I should have torn that door off its hinges.
Should have scrogged her ears off. Should have broken the bed. What do
you want? Well?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I–I was wondering–is there anything you
shouldn’t eat–because of jungle fever?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I could eat a raw baby crocodile. The way to
get your wife back is in bed. Do such a job on her that she’ll be lucky
if she can crawl around on all fours. We’re starving. Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She had two lovers, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are
compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness– maudlin concern.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He and his love are like a retiarius. Do you
know what a retiarius is?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: He’s a kind of gladiator who fights with
a knife and a net and doesn’t wear anything but a jockstrap.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You told me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: When we were up in the tree so long–with
the bats.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh. I’d forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Fourteen times you told me. I
counted.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You’d get this funny look in your eyes,
and I’d say to myself, “Oh, Jesus–he’s going to tell me what a retiarius
is again.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Let me guess–breakfast is served?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I do not wish to be scrogged–ever. I never
heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never
wanted to have happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s what you’re supposed to say.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This is not a coy deception. I do not want
to be scrogged. I want love. I want tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You don’t know you want. That’s the way God
built you!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I will not be scrogged. I remember one
time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of
pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn’t feel.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It couldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’d like to have the expert opinion of the
fish–along with yours.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Fish can’t feel.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Well, I can. Some injuries, spiritual or
physical, can be excruciating to me. I’m not a silly carhop any more.
Maybe you’re right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn’t feel much
more than a fish would. But I’ve been sensitized. I have ideas now–and
solid information. I know a lot more now–and a lot of it has to do with
you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Such as?…</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The whole concept of heroism–and its
sexual roots.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tell me about its sexual roots.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s complicated and I don’t want to go
into it now, because it’s bound to sound insulting–even though nobody
means for anybody to be insulted. It’s just the truth.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I like the truth. I wouldn’t be alive today
if I weren’t one of the biggest fans truth ever had.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Well–part of it is that heroes basically
hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while
they’re there.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And they have very mixed feelings about
women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that
they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly
and gently. They can scrog them, as you say– for revenge.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You learned this in some college course?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I learned a lot of things in college.
Actually–it was Norbert who told me that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The doctor.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And what is his most cherished
possession?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: His most cherished possession? His violin,
I guess.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And he keeps it in his apartment?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And no one’s there now?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s too bad. I would rather have him at
home–to see what I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He did his best to destroy my most precious
possession, which is the high opinion women have of me. I’m now going to
even that score. I’m going to break in his door and I’m going to smash
his violin.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No you’re not!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Because if you do–I’ll leave you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: We have this new club up here in
Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Yes, we do.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: We only have two members so far, but
it’s growing all the time.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: We have enough for a shuffleboard
team. In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything. Hitler plays
shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Mozart plays shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in
Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Jack the Ripper plays
shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard. Jesus Christ plays
shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: It was almost worth the trip–to find
out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing
shuffleboard. I like his sense of humor, though–you know? He’s got a
blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears. You know what it says on the
back? “Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.” Most people don’t get it. Most
people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: We’re going to have jackets, aren’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: You bet! “The Harold Ryan Fan Club.”
Pink, eh? With a yellow streak up the back. We got very good tailor
shops up here. They’ll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of
sweatsuit you want. Judas Iscariot–he’s got this black jacket with a
skull and crossbones over the heart. He walks around all hunched over,
and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his
jacket are the words, “Go take a flying–</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: leap at the moon.”</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Aha! Hello! You’re Mildred,
right?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: I heard you were looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: You were Harold Ryan’s third wife.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan
Club? Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Do I have to? Who’s the little girl?</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.
I don’t really know him.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Thought you were another wife, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: I’m only ten years old.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: That’s what he wanted–a ten-year- old wife.
He’d come home from a war or a safari, and he’d wind up talking to the
little kids.</p>
<p><strong>wanda june</strong>: Won’t you please join our club?
Please?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Honey–Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the
time I’ve got–and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget. He
drove me to drink. He drove his first two wives to drink.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Because he was cruel?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Premature ejaculation.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Ach soooooooooo.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: No grown woman is a fan of premature
ejaculation. Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring. He would the
kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.
He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in
them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a
woman could give him, and he’d tear off my clothes. He would carry me
into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet. That was very
important to him. I did it. I tried to be a good wife. He told me to
imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo. I couldn’t do that, but I
pretended I did. It was all over–ten seconds after he’d said the word
“buffalo.” Then he’d zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war
stories to the little kids. Any little kids.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: That is sad.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Is it? I have this theory about why men
kill each other and break things.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald</strong>: Ja?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Never mind. It’s a dumb theory. I was going
to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual…but alcohol.
Peace.</p>
<p><strong>von konigswald wanda june</strong>: Peace. Peace.</p>
<p><strong>woody woodpecker voice</strong>: Ha ha ha ha ha! You got me,
pal.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Go to the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Of course! Not only go to it but go to it in
full uniform! Rent a uniform!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: That’s against the law, isn’t it? I can’t
wear a uniform anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wear your uniform and every decoration, and
let them despise you, if they dare.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I
used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off
of statues and defecated into grand pianos. I now understand: It was to
teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform–
uncontrollable fear. To our women.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I didn’t know we had any women left.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The world is teeming with women– ours to
enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Every time I start thinking like that I
get the clap.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This could be my next wife.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How are you, honeybunch?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Is Penelope in?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The posies are for her?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I wanted to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’ve come to the right man.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I forgot my vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I forget mine for years on end.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Oh my God– And you are Looseleaf
Harper.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life,
Looseleaf! To have a grown man realize who I was–and faint! End of Act
Two.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Two days later. The afternoon of the day of
Looseleaf Harper’s mother-in-law’s funeral. You got it? Two days later.
You know what happened in Heaven today? There was a tornado. I’m not
kidding you–there was a Goddamn tornado. Tore up fifty-six houses, a
dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel. Drove a shuffleboard stick clear
through a telephone pole. Nobody got killed. Nobody ever gets killed.
They just bounce around a lot. Then they get up– and start playing
shuffleboard. I never saw a tornado when I was alive, and I grew up in
Oklahoma. There’s this big, black, funnel- shaped cloud. Sounds like a
railroad train without the whistle. I had to come to Heaven to see a
thing like that. A lot of people got photographs. After the tornado was
over, a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me–to
use up the roll. I don’t like people who go around taking pictures of
everything. Nothing’s real to some people unless they’ve got
photographs. Two days later–right?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I told you the uniform wouldn’t help.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It helped more than you know. Down deep,
people were deeply affected.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You keep on saying “deep” and “deeply.” I
wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I can’t get over how you guys are my
friends. Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Eight years you guys were together– through
thick and thin.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: For seven and a half of those years we were
heavily drugged–or we would have been home long before now, believe me.
We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a
strange blue soup.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Blue soup.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It sapped our will–made us peaceful and
unenterprising. It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more
sleepy Indians.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: So, kid–how they hanging? Or don’t you
say that to a little kid?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He’s a man. Tell him you’re a man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m a man.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’ve got to do something to make this boy’s
voice change. I wonder if we couldn’t get bull balls somewhere, and fry
’em up. Still miss your mother?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re free to go to her, if you want. If
you’d rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Are we really going to find out where the
elephants go to die?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d rather go to Viet Nam.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Would somebody please pass me the
catsup?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What you say is, “Pass the fucking
catsup.”</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Pass the fucking catsup.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I keep thinking about Africa–and the
elephants.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I don’t think I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Of course you’ll go! You’re going to fly the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re so low! Look at that beautiful red
meat. You haven’t touched it.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Sorry. At least you’ve got a place to
come back to. I don’t have a place to come back to anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: All the more reason to go to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno. You know. I used to really love
that Alice. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You know her for what she is now–
garbage.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She was always a rotten wife! She was
against everything manly you ever wanted to do. He was the most daring
test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit. She
made him become a life insurance salesman instead.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I’d think any woman worth her salt would be
proud to be married to a test pilot. I know I would.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: She tried to like it. She was a very
nervous woman.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I could tell that at the funeral. Would you
please pass the fucking catsup again? Was it dangerous testing
planes?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno. Who knows? You know– you’re up
there, and you’re in some plane nobody ever flew before. You put her
into a dive, and everything starts screaming and shaking, and maybe some
pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face.
You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess, and then you pull
back on the controls, and you black out for a couple of seconds. When
you come to, everything’s usually fairly okay–except maybe you threw up
all over yourself. It’s just another job, but you try and tell Alice
that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Insurance!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You actually sold insurance!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I tried. I sold him some. That was the
only insurance I ever sold.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: What an awful sound!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Get used to it. Back door, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s possible, of course, that you’ll die in
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I’ve considered that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Selling vacuum cleaners isn’t the best
preparation you could have.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I just want one true adventure before I
die.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That can be arranged.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s Mom.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Hi, Penelope.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shut up, you ninny! You were never to come
here again– for any reason whatsoever!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I came for my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sneaking in the back door.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I rang. It seemed like the proper door for
a servile, worthless organism to use.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Your clothes are at the city dump by now.
Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I came for Paul as well.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If he wants to go.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You took him to the funeral, I hear.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He’d never seen a corpse. He’s seen a dozen
now.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: A dozen?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s a big and busy funeral home.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Did you like it, dear?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It isn’t a matter of liking. It’s a matter
of getting used to death– as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind
leaving? No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back–for
anything.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Unless she has nerve.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: More nerve than the doctor, I must admit. He
hasn’t been home for two days. Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep
and color television–and the violin?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He knows you shattered his violin.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m dying to hear of his reaction. The
thrill of smashing something isn’t in the smashing, but in the owner’s
reactions.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He cried.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: About a broomstick and a cigar box–and the
attenuated intestines of an alley cat.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Two hundred years old.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He feels awful loss–which was precisely my
intention.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: violin, and, incidentally, placing herself
much closer</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: the futility of such</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Do you hope with all your heart that someone
will be using this vacuum cleaner two hundred years from now?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Fifty years?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You’re making a joke.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m interested in long-term
expectations.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: It’s engineered to last about fifteen
years.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: addressing the</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: HAROLD reflects majestically on the</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: and worried his</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Things.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You feel I’ve done a dreadful
thing–leaving him?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: If I were married to him, I sure wouldn’t
walk out.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Never mind the condition of your body and
your spirit! Look after your things, your things!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And you, Colonel? Let me guess: You don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Go live in a safe-deposit box–with your
things.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Jesus–I wouldn’t want to be married to
him. You know?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I wouldn’t want to be married to me.
We’re too crazy. You know?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: In what way, pray tell?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I didn’t like that violin thing. That was
sad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tit for tat–as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: You never played a violin.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Yeah. I practically forgot. But after you
busted that thing, I got to thinking, “Jesus–maybe I’ll start the violin
again.” That didn’t just belong to Woodly. That belonged to everybody.
Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun. After you
busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself,
“Jesus–who could blame her?”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maybe it’s time you got out.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re an imbecile.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I know you think that.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Everybody thinks that.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Anybody who’d drop an atom bomb on a city
has to be pretty dumb.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of
your life!</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I don’t think so. It could have been.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If what?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: If I hadn’t done it. If I’d said to
myself, “Screw it. I’m going to let all those people down there
live.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: They were enemies. We were at war.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: Yeah, Jesus–but wars would be a lot
better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, “Jesus–I’m
not going to do that to the enemy. That’s too much.” You could have been
the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don’t know how to
make a violin, just by not busting it up. I could have been the father
of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not
dropping the bomb. I sent ’em to Heaven instead–and I don’t think there
is one.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Goodbye, Looseleaf.</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: So long, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What will you do, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>looseleaf</strong>: I dunno. Marry the first whore who’s nice
to me, I guess. Get a job in a motorcycle shop. So long, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Who’s going to fly our helicopter now?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: We got to get another pilot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: For Africa.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Do you really think that Harold Ryan would
go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You invited me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: To make an ass of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: What went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’re ahead of schedule, that’s all. You’re
finding out here what you would have found out in Africa– that you are a
rabbit, born to be eaten alive.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Gee whiz–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It would have been fun to see you drop your
rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I wouldn’t drop my gun.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re hollow, like a woman.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: I’m smarter than Looseleaf.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He can shoot! He can hold his ground! He can
attack! You’re in your proper profession right now– sucking up dirt for
frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: How do you know how I’d act in Africa?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look how you’re acting now! This is a moment
of truth, and you’re almost crying. Slug me!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You’re my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Out! Out!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: No matter what you say to me, I still think
you’re the greatest guy I ever knew.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: You–you aren’t going to have any friends
left, if you don’t watch out.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well–what have we here? A family.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Almost a Christmas scene.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Just one favor.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Money? There’s plenty of that. Mildred got
the brewery. You’ll probably get the baseball team.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I want you to tell me that you loved me
once.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I mean it! I must have that, and so must
Paul. Tell him that he was conceived in love, even though you hate me
now. Tell both of us that somewhere is our lives was love.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Testimonials of that sort are–are beyond my
range. I don’t do them well. That’s a failing, I know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t care. I don’t care if there was love
or not. That’s all right. I’m going to go to my room and close the door.
I don’t want to hear any more.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: See how you’ve upset him. He was so merry
and hale before you came home.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How unhappy he’s going to be–alone in his
room.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He’ll play with his rifle, I expect. That
will cheer him up.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Rifle?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I bought him a twenty-two yesterday–on the
way home from Hamburger Heaven. And where is the good doctor? Have you
two feathered a love nest somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s in East St. Louis with his
mother–visiting an aunt.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Last I heard, his mother was going
alone.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s afraid of you, Harold. He knew you’d
want to fight him. He doesn’t know anything about fighting. He hates
pain.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not
detest him for his cowardice?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It seems highly intelligent to me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What kind of a country has this become? The
men wear beads and refuse to fight–and the woman adore them. America’s
days of greatness are over. It has drunk the blue soup.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Blue soup?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.
It put us in a haze–a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the
edge. We laughed, we sang, we snoozed. When a bird called, we answered
back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought.
Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried. We had a
funeral that went on for five days–for the cockroach! I sang “Oh Promise
Me.” Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to “Oh
Promise Me”? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for
the hydraulic system of a B-36. All the time we were drinking more blue
soup, more blue soup! Never stopped drinking blue soup. Blue soup all
the time. We’d go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and
everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Sounds quite beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Beautiful, you say? It wasn’t life, it
wasn’t death–it wasn’t anything! Beautiful? Seven years gone– like that,
like that! Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of
nothingness, when there could have been so much!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: physical, seizing a</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: .22 rifle at a high</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s a rifle you have?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Of course it is. Is it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Open the bolt!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s a cartridge, if I’m not mistaken.
Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion
cap–all set to go.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was cleaning it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into
the chamber–where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gee whiz, Dad–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!
Load that gun!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dad–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Too late! It’s man to man now. Protecting
your mother from me, are you? Protect her!`</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s a child!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: With an iron penis three feet long. Load it,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’re begging him to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If he thinks he’s man enough.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s really what you want. You become
furious when people won’t make you dead.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m teaching my son to be a man.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: So he can kill you. You hate your own life
that much. You beg for a hero to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I plan to live one hundred years!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If that’s the case–what’s to prevent my
killing myself?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Honor, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What a handsome word.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: But it’s all balled up in your head with
death. The highest honor is death. When you talk of these animals, one
by one, you don’t just talk of killing them. You honored them with
death. Harold–it is not honor to be killed.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If you’ve lived a good life, fought
well–</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s still just death, the absence of
life–no honor at all. It’s worse than the blue soup by far– that
nothingness. To you, though, it’s the honor that crowns them all.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: May I continue with the rearing of my son?
Load that gun!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Load it!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Then speak, by God! Can you fight with
words?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t want to fight you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Get mad! Tell me you don’t like the way I
treat your mother! Tell me you wish I’d never come home!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s your house, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Everybody simply evaporates! There are guest
issues to be fought out here–or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the
champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and
his aunt! I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a
violin.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The old heroes are going to have to get
used to this, Harold–the new heroes who refuse to fight. They’re trying
to save the planet. There’s no time for battle, no point to battle
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of
satisfaction in prospect. We don’t have to fight with steel. I can fight
with words. I’m not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for
want of a vocabulary. Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope. Tell him
to come here.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan–he’s
going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t know. I hope he never hunts. I
hope he never kills another human being.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You hope this, too?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know what I hope. But I don’t think
you care what I hope, anyway. You don’t know me. You don’t know her,
either. I don’t think you know anybody. You talk to everybody just the
same.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m talking to you gently now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. But it’s going to get loud again.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’s right, Harold. To you, we’re simply
pieces in a game–this one labeled “woman,” that one labeled “son.” There
is no piece labeled “enemy” and you are confused.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: There won’t be anybody out there. That’s the
new style: nobody anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s really that bad?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You fool, you fool.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Oh–look at the poor, crucified violin, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It died for your sins.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: This little corpse is intended as a
lesson?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: There’s a certain amount of information
there.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Lest we forget how cruel you are.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m going to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is man to man.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: It’s healer to killer. Is that the same
thing?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What brought you back?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: The same hairy, humorless old gods who move
you from hither to yon. “Honor,” if you like.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He’s a champion after all.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Of the corpses and cripples you create for
our instruction–when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you
are.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This is suicide. Go get the police.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: There’s going to be no bloodshed here. I
know how he’ll fight–the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.
Am I correct?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I can defeat him with anything from flavored
toothpicks to siege howitzers. But he got it into his little head that
he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!
Correct?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What an hallucination! Oh, dear, dear, dear,
dear. Oh dearie me.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You haven’t heard me yet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You intend to crack my eardrums with your
voice? Will I bleed from my every orifice? Who will clean up this awful
mess?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: We’ll find out now, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No, we won’t. No matter how it begins, it
will end in death. Because it always does. Isn’t that always how it
ends, Harold–in death?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: There has to be a threat of some sort,
nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. These
elements are lacking.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re a filthy, rotten bastard.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oooooo. That hurt.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re old–so old.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Now who’s being cruel?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and
the horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We do survive, don’t we? You’re going to
have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That’s a matter
of form–not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard. No rush about
that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re a son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes–well–uh–that’s another one of those
statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.
Whenever you feel like it. It’s sort of like turning off an alarm clock
that’s ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m turning off the alarm. I’m turning off
everything.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ah! The lady is armed.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I want you to get out of here, Norbert.
Harold–I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until
Norbert is gone.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell
everybody else exactly what to do. It’s the American way.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Then you’d better fix your bayonet, because
there aren’t any bullets in the gun.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Where’s the bullet?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Help your mother find the bullet.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: There it is. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How do I load?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Load it for her.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Cock it, too.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Give it to her.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous
now?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The National Safety Council would be
appalled.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Then listen to me. You’re both
disgusting–with your pride, your pride. I hate you for coming here–like
a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away.
But here you are now–high noon in the Superbowl! You fool, you fool.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Everything’s going to be beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You fake! You’re no better than the
dumbest general in the Pentagon. You’re not going to beat Harold. You’re
not going to beat anybody. You’re not going to stay here,
either–yammering and taunting until you’re most gloriously killed. Go
home!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s right, Norbert–go home.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I haven’t said all I have to say.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I haven’t told you, Harold, how comical I
think you are.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Comical?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Sit down or I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Give me that Goddamn thing! Now get out of
here, or I might kill you. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’ve killed women?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Seventeen of them–eleven by accident. March!
Move! You, too!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Norbert–you come, too. Let him go, Harold.
Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Of course he can go–if he’ll just go down on
his hands and knees for a moment–and promise me that he does not find me
comical in the least degree.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Do it, Norbert.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Hands and knees, you say?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And terror, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Goodbye! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Get the police! No time to lose!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re in one hell of a jam. You realize
that?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m high as a kite.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Glands. You’re supposed to be happy when you
die. Call me comical again.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re a clown. You’re a clown who kills–but
you’re a clown.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I love you! Have a cigar!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Evolution has made you a clown– with a
cigar. Simple butchers like you are obsolete!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m to be left behind–in primordial
ooze?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: If you’re at home in the ooze, and nowhere
else.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is going to become very physical. Are
you prepared for that?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’re not such a creature of the ooze that
you’d hurt an unarmed man.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m an honorable clown?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: King Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You hope.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: In any event, I will not beg for mercy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No quarter asked. No quarter given.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Don’t you laugh even inwardly at the heroic
balderdash you spew?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Cut me open. Find out.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’ve struck my blow.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: With spittle?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’ve poisoned you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Lucretia Borgia? Something I drank or
touched? You refused a cigar. That’s it! Potassium cyanide in the
humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I put a poisoned thought in your head. Even
now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind. It’s saying,
“Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete,” and, “Clown, clown, clown.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Poison.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You have a very good mind, or I wouldn’t
have come back. That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, “Is
Harold Ryan really a clown?” And the answer is, “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I–I really must congratulate you. Something
is happening in there.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You can never take yourself seriously again!
Look at all the creatures you’ve protected us from! Did you shoot them
on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: The magic root you gave me–I had it
analyzed. It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893! He explored
your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a
talent for languages, and a pocketknife.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You aren’t going to hurt me. You aren’t
going to hurt anybody any more. Any violent gesture will seem
ridiculous–to yourself!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don Quixote.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: My violin is avenged!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Something seems to have happened to my
self-respect.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: And the hell with it. It was so tragically
irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The new hero is you.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I hate crowds, and I have no charisma–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re too modest.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: But the new hero will be a man of science
and of peace–like me. He’ll disarm you, of course. No more guns, no more
guns.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Was I ever of use?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Never. For when you began to kill for the
fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Here. Finish the job.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: I’m utterly satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re making a mistake. Obsolete old
carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded. You’ve wounded
me.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: More clowning! Don’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We never quit fighting until we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: You’d be killing a friend. Don’t you know
how much I like you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m going to shoot you now.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: My self-respect is gone–and my soldier’s
honor with it. It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: New dignity can be yours–as a merciful man.
You can change!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Like the saber-toothed tiger.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Oh God–you’re really going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It won’t hurt as much as the sting of a
bumblebee. Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You’ll like it
there.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Can I beg for mercy–on my knees?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If you want to be found that way.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: What is this thing that kills me?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Man, as man was meant to be–a vengeful ape
who murders. He will soon be extinct. It’s time, it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Don’t shoot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ve enjoyed being man.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Have it your way. We’d both be better off
dead now.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Crawl home.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Thank you–for my life.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s trash now, like mine.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: New lives begin!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Somewhere in this city. Not here, not here.
Tell Penelope I loved her–in my clownish way. And Paul. Tell him to be a
healer, by all means.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Leave the rifle here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ll put it in Paul’s room, where it
belongs.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Give me your word of honor that that’s all
you’re going to do.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: For what it’s worth now, Harold Ryan, the
clown, gives his sacred word.</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>woodly</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I missed.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: The end.</p>
