<h1 id="major-league">major-league</h1>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Spring training starts the twelfth. How do
you think the Indians will do this year?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: They don’t look too good.</p>
<p><strong>business executive</strong>: They don’t look particularly
good, do they?</p>
<p><strong>longshoremen</strong>: I’ll tell ya. They don’t look very
fuckin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>groundskeeper</strong>: They’re shitty.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Thirty minutes late. Think she’ll show?</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: She’s got to. She’s the damn owner
now.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: She didn’t last week. She was having a
guava facial.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another
season of Indians’ baseball.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know that it may not seem the same without
Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this
team will have made history.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Unfortunately there are some in the press
who feel that… “the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business
being the owner of a major league baseball team.”</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Obviously, Donald didn’t feel that way or he
wouldn’t have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a
dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this
franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Spring training begins in two weeks. Here’s
the list of people we’ll be inviting to camp this year.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I could sit here and tell you what a great
year we’re gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we
had to free agency. We haven’t won a pennant in 30 years. We haven’t
even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it’s time to make
some changes. What do ya think?</p>
<p><strong>simmons</strong>: I never heard of half these guys. And the
ones I do know are way past their prime.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Most of these guys never had a prime.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: This guy here is dead.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Cross him off then.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Let’s not be hasty.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s time to shake things up, Charlie. Clear
the board and start over.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Well, it’s not the best material I’ve ever
had to work with, but I’ll do my best to see we move up a notch this
year.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know you will, Charlie. That’s why I’m
movin’ you up to General Manager. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, that should do it for today. Thank
you, gentlemen. Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: One minute, 58 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>body-builder assistant</strong>: Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps
would like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I’m glad you called me in. I’m still
unclear on a couple things</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh, really? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Well, if I’m the G.M., who’s gonna be the
Manager?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I was thinking of Lou Brown.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Lou Brown?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the
International League for the last 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I think he’ll fit right in with our team
concept.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What exactly is our team concept?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I
want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What do you mean? Some of these guys are
furniture movers?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m serious about this, Charlie. It’s no
secret I’ve never liked Cleveland much. The weather’s lousy, downtown is
a pit, the stadium’s falling apart, and we can’t draw dick. Another
couple of years of this and I’m gonna have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog
food.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Mrs. Phelps, you can’t just up and move a
team on a whim…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s hardly a whim. Miami’s offered to build
us a new stadium – 62,000 capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no rent for the
first million at the gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45
percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the
stadium operations costs. No other franchise in baseball can match that
deal.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Even so, the League’ll never let us leave
Cleveland. We got a lease with the city.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The lease says we have the right to move if
our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year. Paragraph 40, line
17.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: If we play bad enough, we should be able to
come in under that.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What are you saying? You want us to
lose?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No, we’ve been losing. What I want us to do
is finish dead last.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Mister Phelps would never have approved of
this.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He knew it had to be done. He just didn’t
have the courage to do it. Hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of
it. If this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst
record in all baseball.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan, new
G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I wanted to call and say the organization
remembers you fondly from the years you played here and we’d love to
have you come to spring training for a shot at this year’s club.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Is that you, Tolbert? This isn’t very funny,
ya know. I’m hung over. My knees are killin’ me. If you were gonna pull
this shit, you could’ve at least said you were from the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: By the way, you were with me last night.
Who’s this girl on top of me?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Tolbert.</p>
<p><strong>tolbert</strong>: Who the hell were you talkin’ to?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Lines three and four are waiting for you,
Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR- 70’s.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Tire World.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the new G.M.
of the Cleveland Indians. Listen, Lou, I hope you’re sittin’ down ‘cause
I got an offer you probably been dreamin’ about your whole life. We been
watchin’ your progress down there at Toledo with a lotta interest and
well… How would you like to manage the Indians this year?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What do ya mean you don’t know? This is a
chance to manage in the big leagues.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie. I got
a guy on the other line about some whitewalls. I’ll talk to ya
later.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Rick, we heard about your pitching out at
Portland last year…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’m, ah, not with them anymore…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: We’d still like to take a look at ya at our
spring camp in Arizona, March first.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Yeh, well, I’m not sure I can make it by
then.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Don’t worry, we’re gettin’ you out on a
sort of work furlough deal. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Yeh. Where’s Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty
years. Don’t you wanna advance some?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I used to coach the unwed mothers’ softball
team. I have advanced some.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Well, what are you really worried about?
The money?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Naw, I’m just not sure I’d be happy in a big
organization like that. Owners are always on your back, tryin’ to “help
you out.”</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I don’t think that’s gonna be a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Down here baseball’s a game, not a business.
I don’t wanta be a babysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they
know it all already.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: We don’t have any millionaires.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Well then, bonus babies or whatever you
got…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Don’t have any bonus babies either.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Don’t you have any proven major league
talent?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Well, then… I’ll be up in a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Sounds like my kinda team. Have my contracts
ready.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Guess I really put the screws to him.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Taylor, telephone for you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Jake, Charlie Donovan again.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I’m sorry about this
morning…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts on the
first. Can you make it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You been stayin’ in shape down there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I thought so. See ya in Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Let’s go, Taylor. You’re up.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Luis, I’m not gonna be playin’ anymore. I
got a tryout in the States.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Fine. Leave your uniform.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But I changed at the motel.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Leave your uniform.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: This looks like Jake Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Wish we had him two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Four years ago then.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What happened to the private rooms?</p>
<p><strong>temple</strong>: We’re on an austerity program. This is what
happens when you finish 24 games out.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I think it’s Cerrano. Defected from Cuba.
Wanted religious freedom.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: What’s his religion?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Voodoo.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Thought you didn’t have any high- priced
talent.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I forgot about Dorn, ’cause he’s only
high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Yeh, he just can’t field it.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: We’ll shape him up.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Don’t recognize this guy.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I play like
Mays and run like Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff…</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I don’t remember a Hayes on the list.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Look at this fuckin’ guy.</p>
<p><strong>temple</strong>: Maybe he’s the mascot.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks like a
fuckin’ toilet brush. Hey, T.B., I love your pony tail. And the
earring’s cute too. Where’s the matching bracelet?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Jake Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush,
or you got another name?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget about Dorn. He’s always a little
tough on rookies. You’ll get a lot worse from other teams.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Say hey! How ya doin’? Willie Mays Hayes
here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Jake Taylor. Rick Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What the hell league you been playin’ in?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: California Penal.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Never heard of it. How’d you wind up playin’
there?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I stole a car.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This guy wasn’t invited to camp.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most
managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody’s
a lock at any position, and that talent isn’t everything. They’d rather
see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of
all they want you to have fun out there, even though they’re gonna work
your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The
difference between me and those other managers is… I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Shit, I been cut already?</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: 11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you’d fallen
down.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Get him a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: C’mon, Hayes, let’s do ’em right.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no pain.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: How the knees holdin’ up, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Great. Never been better.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Mobility’s good? No problem gettin’ off the
throw to second?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who can keep
this team together on the field. You were a helluva player when you were
sound, but around the league they think you can’t take the pounding
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Around the league they’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I’m gonna have to put you to the test, ya
know. So, I want the absolute truth here. Are you 100 percent?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin’ like
that?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You better if you wanna make this team.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: C’mon, Hayes, this isn’t the All Star Game.
Get up to the damn plate.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like
shit.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: My stroke’ll come back once I get warmed
up.</p>
<p><strong>temple</strong>: Never did get warmed up last year. Hit .211
at Maine. I looked him up.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. His
speed could be a big asset.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: For what? Running back to the dugout?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You gotta stop swingin’ for the fences
though, Hayes. All you’re gonna do is give yourself a hernia. With your
speed you should be hittin’ the ball on the ground, leggin’ ’em out.
Every time I see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Hey, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit. You
can’t teach him to run.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All right, Vaughn, they tell us you’re a
pitcher. Let’s see what you got.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Nice velocity.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Sounded like it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sorry, Lou, I wasn’t quite expectin’ that
much octane.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>clubhouse man</strong>: 96 miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Better teach him some control before he kills
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: C’mon, Dorn, get in front of the damn ball.
Don’t give me this ole’ bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: I took one of these in the eye last year.
Nearly lost my sight.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I’m deeply moved. Every time you play it off
your hip, you give me forty sit-ups.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: What! That’s Little League shit.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: So is this.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come nobody
else picked up on him?</p>
<p><strong>temple</strong>: Okay, Harris, that’s enough fast balls.
Throw some curves.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Lou, I wanna have a word with you here.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do? I got
it right here in my contract that I don’t have to do any calisthenics I
don’t feel are necessary. What do ya think of that?</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: We got anybody left playin’ baseball out
there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Shit, the way I played today, I wouldn’t be
surprised if they red- tagged me already.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What do ya mean?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Red tag in your locker means the manager
wants to see you, ’cause you just died and went to the minors.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry, they don’t cut anybody the
first day.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What is that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of ’em
will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Course if it’s cold and I got a shirt on
under my jersey, I just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it
runnin’. I need to load up the ball a little, I just wipe my nose.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: You put snot on the ball?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: At my age, you put anything you can find on
it. I haven’t got an arm like yours.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What are you doin’ there, Pedro?</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Bats. They are sick.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So are mine. Is somethin’ goin’ around?</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: No hit curve ball. Straight ball, hit it
very much. Curve ball, bats are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. Take fear
from bats.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Jo-Buu?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Maybe he’s the pagan saint of baseball.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: I offer him cigars and gin. He will
come.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: I wouldn’t leave this gin sittin’ around out
here with this group.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu’s gin. Is very
bad.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: This is final cut down day, right?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh, better get your snake ready, Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: No, I’m goin’ cold turkey today. My hands are
too screwed up to hold it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If you’re gonna use that head first slide,
you better get yourself some gloves or you’re not gonna have any skin
left on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I don’t wanna go in there.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Whatever happens, keep it to yourself until
you’re outta the locker room. Don’t celebrate in front of guys who just
died.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What if we’re one of the deceased?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: C’mon, Vaughn, let’s show some nuts here. If
they cut us, we’ll just sign with the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You haven’t
heard the last of me. You think I’m shit now, but someday you’ll be
sorry you cut me. I’m gonna catch on somewhere else, and every time I
pitch against you, I’m gonna stick it up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Good, I like that kinda spirit in a player.
The only problem is, I didn’t cut you.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I think somebody’s been havin’ fun with
you.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: What’s the matter, little lady? Can’t you take
a joke?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Can I have your attention, please? I counted
up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy. If
you hadn’t, I woulda told you he won anyway. Mr. C for the year – Jake
Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget about Dorn. You got other things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Packing for Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You see the new lineup the Indians got?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I never heard of most of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>business executive</strong>: I don’t know the majority of
these names.</p>
<p><strong>longshoreman</strong>: Who are these fuckin’ guys?</p>
<p><strong>groundskeeper</strong>: They’re shitty.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Two down. Bottom of the ninth.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Really got all of that one.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What was it? A slider?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What are you gonna have?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I don’t know. What language is this?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: French.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: They got patty melts over there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget it. I’ll order. Let’s have a
toast.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Here’s to baseball, here’s to the start of
two great careers, and for me, here’s to at least one more good year in
the sun.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What is it? The chick?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Does she know it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I mean she woulda been if I hadn’t screwed
it up. Who’s that guy she’s with?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I don’t know. He’s not wearing a name
tag.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: You want me to beat the shit out of him?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What does she do?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: She’s a librarian.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: A librarian? Shit, I gotta start readin’
again.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Miss Wells, there’s a telephone call for
you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello, Lynn. It’s Jake.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Jake? How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Just a hunch. I took you there when you got
your masters. I figure you’re probably wearing the black velvet dress
with the red sash.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: How did you know that? I didn’t have this
dress when we were…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Thanks. What are you doin’ here? Aren’t you
supposed to be in Mexico somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m playin’ with the Indians again. Back in
the Bigs.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: That’s great. I’m happy for you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I gotta get back…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Wait a minute. What’s your number. I tried
calling you at home, but you’re not listed…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: My life is different from when you knew
me.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Meaning what? That I don’t know you
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Couldn’t we talk about this some other time? I
really gotta…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Okay, just gimme your number.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why not? Because of the guy you’re with?
What is he, a banker?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Lawyer. Please, Jake, he’s watching us.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not leavin’ without your number. You
still wear those great little tortoise-shell glasses? I always loved it
when you took them off.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The number, Lynn…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: All right. 555-9314.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Thank you. I’m back, Lynn, and I’m gonna be
around.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What’s the number again?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: 1036.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Furnished apartment building owned by the
Indians. We get special rates. With what we’re makin’ we’ll need it.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Welcome to the Big Leagues.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You got anybody workin’ there named Lynn
Wells?</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Never heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Take it easy. We got 162 of these to go.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All right, let’s gather ’round.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I’m not much for inspirational addresses. I
just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us
to finish last. The local press thinks we’d save everybody a lot of time
and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves. Me, I like to waste
sportswriters’ time so I’m for hangin’ around and seein’ if we can give
all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Aren’t we gonna have a prayer? I mean we’re
not all savages like Cerrano.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You guys go ahead. I belong to the church of
three-run homers.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: All right, let’s bow our heads.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Have to wake up bats.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Dear Lord, we ask…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You read the Plain Dealer today? They said
this is gonna be the worst Indian team we’ve had in years.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Everybody laughs at the Indians now, but
there were other times. Even won the Series in ’48. Then Willie Mays
made that catch on Vic Wertz in the ’54 Series and Cleveland’s never
been the same since.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: As the Indians go so goes Cleveland,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would
die.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, welcoming
all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians baseball. A
lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending
American League champs, the New York Yankees. And listen to the roar of
the crowd as the Indians takes the field!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yes, sir, they love this club here in
Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes under it
now… Oh, makes a basket catch, Willie Mays style, and the side is
retired.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All right, way to look, way to look. Nice
catch, Hayes. Don’t ever fuckin’ do it again. Okay, let’s get it
goin’!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Bottom of the first, Willie Mays Hayes to
lead it off for the tribe.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A lotta people say you can tell how a
season’s gonna go by the first hitter of the year. In the last fifteen
years, the Indians have never had the season lead-off hitter reach
base.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks it
down, gets up, fires to first. Too late! Hayes beats it!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And so the string is broken. Maybe things
will turn around a little for the Indians this year.</p>
<p><strong>bleacher band</strong>: In the land of burning waters, waters
Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we Love those mighty Redmen, Turn
their foes to dead men, Ummmmm.</p>
<p><strong>first baseman</strong>: Showed some real power on that one,
Slugger.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I plan to get at least a double out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And now Hayes is putting on a pair of black
gloves, sending a little message to the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Bought a hundred of these, one for each base
I plan to steal. Excuse me, here, I gotta take my first step toward the
Hall of Fame.</p>
<p><strong>first baseman</strong>: You look real sharp, but you’ll never
steal second with your shoe untied.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Brewster, quick move to first…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: He got him. Hayes is picked off.</p>
<p><strong>first baseman</strong>: Nice base running, dildo. Hard to get
your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, so much for that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: Guy’s goin’. Gotta be goin’… get the
throw up. Don’t bounce the damn ball.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: Nice throw, dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, Ricky
Vaughn, on to pitch now. You can close the book on Winters…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Easy does it, Ricky. We’re only four down.
We’re still in this thing.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Don’t worry if you’re off the plate on a few
pitches. Doesn’t hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: First pitch is a little high…</p>
<p><strong>yankee hitter</strong>: This guy kinda wild?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I figure you got a 30% chance to survive
this at bat.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ball four.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ball eight.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases loaded
on twelve straight pitches. By the laws of probability, you’d think one
of those coulda drifted over the plate.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Wild thing, You make my heart sing, You walk
everything.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Okay kid. I think we got ’em scared enough
now. Time to get a few of ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Just relax, and keep the arm up on top.
Gotta throw strikes. No place at the inn for this guy.</p>
<p><strong>haywood</strong>: Hey, Taylor, what you doin’ back up
here?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Couldn’t cut it in the Mexican League.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Looked like a strike anyway. You want me to
go get him?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: No, let’s see how he reacts.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: At least he hit what he was aimin’ at.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I think you can go get him now.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: C’mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets up, he’s
gonna be lookin’ for you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So, a tough start for the Erie warriors, as
they drop a heartbreaker to the Yankees, nine to nothing. The Post Game
Show was brought to you by… Christ. I can’t find it. The hell with it.
This is Harry Doyle saying good night, everybody, and Happy Hunting.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re off to a good start, gentlemen. Let’s
keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: God, I was horse shit tonight.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Only thing you got to be sorry about was
hittin’ Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If you wanted to send a message, it shoulda
been to Haywood. He hit the damn homer. Coleman was just picking his
nose in the on-deck circle.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget the other stuff. It coulda happened
to anybody. Besides, Haywood didn’t hit it that good. That ball wouldn’t
have been out of a lotta parks.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Oh yeh, name one.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yellowstone.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Jake, you shouldn’t have come here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I was wonderin’ why you’d give an old friend
a bum phone number.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Let’s talk in my office, okay?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t wanna talk in your office.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I told you I don’t think it’s a good idea for
us to see each other.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: We don’t have anything in common. Sometimes I
wonder if we ever did.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What are you talkin’ about? We were both
athletes, world class, hot for each other. What more can you have in
common?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I stopped bein’ an athlete three years ago.
Books are my life now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Don’t you dare laugh, Jake. In two years I’ve
put together one of the best special collections departments in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So what is it? You’re still sore I never
read Moby Dick?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You never read anything I asked you to.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Not like what’s-his-name at the
restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: His name is Tom, and keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What do ya see in this guy?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He’s stable. He’s intelligent… and I’ve never
found him in bed with a stewardess.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s ’cause no stewardess would have him.
Wouldn’t you rather be with somebody who’s in demand?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Just like always, you don’t take anything
seriously. Everything’s a joke to you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I’m just
tryin’ to loosen things up a little. I’m gettin’ frostbite here.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Tom and I are getting married in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What? That’s crazy, Lynn. I got plans for
us.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What plans?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I was gonna play another a year or two, then
we go to Hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic
champions.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: How can you think stuff like that? I haven’t
seen you in two years. You never even wrote me a letter.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m sorry, Lynn, but I wasn’t exactly proud
of my situation. C’mon, you didn’t think about me at all since I been
gone?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Not so loud, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Remember the three nights we spent on the
beach in Vera Cruz? You have nights like that with Mr. Briefcase?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What about the night you had in Detroit with
Miss Dairy Queen?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What was I supposed to do? She bet me fifty
bucks she had a better body than you. I had to defend your honor.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What a bunch of bullshit! I have a much better
body than she does.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: She’s right. Take it from me, she really
does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity, I give her that, but the,
ah, quality just isn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: How many think Lynn oughta give me another
shot?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The ayes have it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You haven’t changed at all, have you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m afraid I have or I wouldn’t be here.
C’mon, Lynn, I don’t wanna do time for things that happened years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m sorry, Jake. You’ll always be the little
boy who wouldn’t grow up.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Lynn, wait…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: A quarter of the season’s gone, we’re 15 and
24, seven games out of first. Our attendance is just below 180,000.
That’s bad, but not bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Projected over the whole season, we stand
to wind up 36 games under .500 and 28 out of first. That should be bad
enough for anybody.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We finished 24 out last year and still drew
890,000. When school’s out for the summer, attendance is liable to rise.
Plus, this team is showing signs of improvement. I didn’t think we’d win
15 games all year. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: On how we can get worse? How about a series
of fines for good play? Maybe a $30,000 bonus to the guy chosen Least
Valuable Player.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: This is no laughing matter, Donovan. I think
maybe the problem is we’re coddling these guys too much.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What’s with this? We never leave from this
terminal.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Maybe the other one’s jammed up.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Which one is ours?</p>
<p><strong>gateman</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What is this, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Front office says it’s an economy measure,
‘cause we’re not drawin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, they certainly have spared every
expense.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Oh, so now you come around. He’s not
fooled.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Call the stewardess, Vaughn. I need one of
those bags.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: There aren’t any stewardesses.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I wonder if there’s any pilots.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Two down, top of the ninth. Last chance for
the red and blue.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Bouncing ball to second. This should be it.
Collins up with it, on to first, and the game is over.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So, the Sons of Geronimo, still suffering a
bit from propeller lag, are nipped by the Tigers tonight, 7 to 0. The
only excitement for the tribe provided by Rick Vaughn who set an
American League record by throwing four wild pitches in one inning.
Congratulations, Rick. For the Tigers, 5 runs, 9 hits, and no errors.
For the Indians, one run, and let’s see, one hit. Is that all we got,
one fucking hit?</p>
<p><strong>stat man</strong>: You can’t say “fuckin’” on the air.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Nobody’s listening
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Who you got lined up tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Where are we? Kansas City, right? Gotta be
Arlene</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: You call her?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Don’t have to. She knows when I’m in town.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m about ready to turn in. I’ve
anesthetized my knees enough.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, can I have your
autograph?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Ah… yeh… sure. My first autograph. I
couldn’t give these away a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I saw your record on the news. You made their
Hall of Shame. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re a celebrity now, Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I thought you had to do somethin’ good to be
a celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Not if you do it colorfully.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: What’d I tell ya.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Hi, Rodger. This is Vicki and Rene.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Hi, doll. This is Steve Harris.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Where’s your buddy Gant?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: They cut him to make room for bristle boy over
there.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Is that Vaughn, the guy they call Wild
Thing?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: He’s kinda cute. They say he could be a big
star.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: What are you talkin’ about? He couldn’t find
the plate if it was magnetized. He won’t last the year.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: He struck out five in a row before the wild
pitches. Maybe I’ll check him out.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Wait a minute, you’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: I don’t remember you makin’ any date.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Since when do I have to make a date? Who’s
been showin’ you this town the last three years?</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta look out
for myself now. I don’t have to be a slave to no .235 hitter.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Wild Thing, you make my heart sing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Guess we’re over with, eh, Dorn?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Speak for yourself, Taylor. I got a couple
good years left.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: “Moby Dick?” What is that?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s one of the masterpieces of American
literature, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Lynn put you on to this?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Well, we’re goin’ to a club tonight. You
wanna come along?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, I got some more reading to do.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What, you got a test or somethin’? Why don’t
you just go over and see her? Maybe she’ll let you slide on a couple of
these.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I might if I knew where she lives.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Easy. Tail her home from the library.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You mean sit in a car and wait for her to
come out? That’s kinda juvenile, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: anything to do with</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Look, Lynn, I’m sorry I followed you home
but I wanna…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: This isn’t my place…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Whose place is it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who’s there, love? Oh, Mr. Taylor, right? I
remember you from the restaurant. Lynn’s told me a lot about you. Why
don’t you come in for a while?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nah, that’s o.k., I got some things to
do…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yeh, he’s gotta be goin’…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, really, come on in for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake Taylor.
Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a
professional baseball player.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So, Jake, what brings you here this
evening?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I, ah, just had a couple books I wanted to
discuss with Lynn. I thought this was her place.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, it soon will be.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged.
Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thank you. What can I get you to drink?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Beer’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What team do you play for, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The Indians.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Here in Cleveland? I didn’t know they still
had a team.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. It’s
really great.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They’re last right now, but hopefully moving
up, eh, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I’m told that baseball players make very
good salaries these days.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That depends on how good they are, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: How good are you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I make the League minimum.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He was one of the best in baseball until he
had problems with his knees.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What are you going to do when your career ends?
I mean you can’t play baseball forever, can you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Somethin’ll come up.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Will it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know, I was thinkin’ of goin’ to
Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic
champions.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh really. In what event?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter
Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You got the girl picked out?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I did, but I wasn’t smart enough to hold on
to her.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: You used to be an athlete, didn’t you,
Lynn?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Two Hundred Individual medley.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Alternate on the ’80 Olympic Team.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, I gotta be goin’. Nice to have met you
all.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Let me walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Thanks for the beer.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ll let you know if I land a good job. I
know you’re concerned about it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to know what she
would’ve had ahead of her.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Stay away from her.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Lou wants to see you down at the office,
Rick.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: C’mon in, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Rick, I’m not gonna beat around the bush
here. You got a great arm, one of the best I’ve ever seen, but your
control hasn’t come around like we hoped it would.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started
out wild and, after workin’ it out in the minors, for a while, went on
to great careers. Take Sandy Koufax there…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What about Koufax?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Never mind Koufax.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Read these letters, starting at the top.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Can’t read it, can you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: You gonna send me to the minors?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: These things make me look ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Drop in the bucket, Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu.
I still can no hit curva ball for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice to
him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sacrifice? You mean like something
living?</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Si. I kill unborn children.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Not while I’m here you’re not. That’s
murder.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All right, let’s hit the field.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Here’s looking at ya, Jo-Buu.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We’re in the ninth, two down, man on first
and the Indians clinging to a one run lead. VAUGHAN, one out away from
his first major league victory…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Bouncing ball, Dorn can’t get to it, into
left field, base hit. Clarke digging around second, he’ll make it to
third, and the A’s have runners at the corners.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: You want me to go get him?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: No, he’s come this far. Let’s see if he can
finish it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Vaughn in a little trouble here, but I’ll
tell ya, these Cleveland fans are great. Listen to them get behind
Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We need some defense here. Maybe we oughta do
a wave.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: C’mon, Indians don’t do waves. Let’s keep
this thing pure.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: What harm could it do?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Runner goes, high, Taylor has no play. The
go-ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at
the plate.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: High ball two, and the crowd doesn’t like
that call one bit.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Okay, let’s get nasty here, Rick. You know
he’s lookin’ for this pitch. Gotta come up with somethin’ studly.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Fuckin’ Dorn. Game shoulda been over by now.
Dorn coulda had that ball. He tanked it on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: This isn’t the California Penal League,
Vaughn. We’re professionals here. We don’t tank a play for personal
reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. You’ve pitched a helluva game. You
wanna finish it, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Can you give me a strike on this pitch?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Yeh, but I don’t know if there’ll be much on
it. My arm feels like jello.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Just make sure it’s over the plate. I want
him to swing.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: The last time I did that, the guy hit one
that hasn’t landed yet.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: By the way, I been meaning to ask you. Why’d
you steal that car?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I was bored.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Next time you might think about takin’ in a
movie or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Helluva situation we got goin’ here, huh,
Rexman? Two on, two out, you’re down by a run in the ninth. You got a
chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don’t
blow it. They’ll be callin’ you a gutless choke artist all over
America.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re a free agent at the end of the year.
Not much demand for gutless choke artists. What are you hittin’ now?
.230? .240?</p>
<p><strong>rexman</strong>: .316.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey, nice average. Uh oh, on second thought,
that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin’ in the
dumper.</p>
<p><strong>rexman</strong>: Shut up, will ya, Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey, I can understand not wantin’ to talk
about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: By the way, I saw your wife at the Capri
Lounge last night. Hell of a dancer. You must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But that guy she was with… I mean I’m sure
he’s a close personal friend of yours and all, but tell me…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: …Why was he wearing her panties on his
head?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Uh oh, Rexie, I don’t think that one’s got
the distance. Maybe if the wind comes up.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: It’s startin’ to come together, Pepper. It’s
startin’ to come together.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Oh hi, Jake, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick word with
Rodger?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Sure, c’mon in, he’s in the den. I’ll get
some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you out
here?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I just wanta tell ya somethin’, but I didn’t
want to do it in front of the whole team.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know what your problem is, but… …if
I ever see you tank another play like you did tonight, I’ll cut off your
nuts and stuff ‘em down your fuckin’ throat.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Coffee anybody?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Why the hell are we havin’ practice during
the All-Star break?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered
it.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: It’s hotter than shit in here. What happened
to the air conditioning?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Oh man, this old body can use a soak.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Forget it. It’s not workin’ again.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Damn it, I thought they were gonna replace
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Hey, there’s no hot water in here.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: She’s at it again. I’ve had it with this
nickel and dime stuff. I’m gonna get the Bitch on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You wanted to see the Bitch?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t you think you oughta cover yourself
with a towel first, Mr. Brown?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: There aren’t any towels, and I’m too old to
be diving under benches.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, I can take it if you can.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: What happened to the new whirlpool we were
supposed to get?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Revenue problems have forced us to cut back
on equipment. We’ll simply have to fix the old one.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You fixed it six times already. And now
there’s no hot water in the showers.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The pipes in this building are old and
rusted. We’re replacing them, but it’s a long, expensive process.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: How am I supposed to keep my players healthy
with cold water and no therapy equipment?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your players will just have to get a little
tougher. What are they, a bunch of pansies?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains,
sore arms, muscle pulls…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s only temporary. Besides, these guys
weren’t playing that good when the equipment was workin’. If I could get
anybody to come and watch this team, none of this would be necessary.
You oughta be grateful I can still pay your salaries.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: In case you haven’t noticed, and judging by
attendance, you haven’t, the Indians, that thought-to-be hopeless
collection of has-been’s and never-will-be’s is actually approaching the
.500 mark, and with it, semi-respectability. Nothing to write home
about, to be sure, but at least we don’t have to cover our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Ya know, they could be a lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>business executive</strong>: Ya know, I may have
underestimated this team a bit.</p>
<p><strong>longshoreman</strong>: Ya know, these guys aren’t so fuckin’
bad.</p>
<p><strong>groundskeeper</strong>: They’re still shitty.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a break, Mel.
I gotta get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>wingo</strong>: All right, kick some dirt on me. The
Commissioner’ll buy that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Right. Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Hey, don’t you go anywhere. I wanna have a
few words with you.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: What are we arguin’ about here?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: wanted to get at</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You mean the one that was a foot outside?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You still got that great kick. Just like the
first time I ever saw you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You follow me here too?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh, what did you want to see me about?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You wouldn’t have been at the game if you
didn’t want to see me about something.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I just wanted to see you play.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: How was I?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You looked good, but you oughta open your
stance a little. They’re pitching you inside.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ll try that. You wanna have some
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Sorry, I already ate.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Right. I forgot your life is different
now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Thanks for the race.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Whose place are we at this time?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Mine. You follow me again?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I figured
you wanted to see me about something.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I just wanted to see you play.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: How was I?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You looked good, but you oughta open your
stance a little. They’re pitchin’ you inside.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ll try that.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I think I oughta tell you that I’m moving in
with Tom.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Goin’ uptown, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m not goin’ uptown, I just want to lead a
regular life. You know, like an adult maybe. With a house and a garden
and normal hours.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You think I can’t lead a regular life?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You like the life you’ve had, Jake. You like
hangin’ out with the boys, livin’ in hotels, eatin’ dinner at midnight,
having girls send you their underwear in the mail. Remember the surprise
party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team? You never showed
up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the
furniture. It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That was a hoax. The girl was just trying to
get some publicity.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yes, but you had obviously been with her. And
it happened in front of all our friends.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I was drownin’, Lynn. The endorsements were
dryin’ up, my knees were goin’, they were talkin’ about sendin’ me down.
I was just trying to hold on to somethin’, prove to myself I was still
an All-Star. I don’t care about that anymore. I know I don’t have much
time left in baseball. I’m just a guy trying to put his life back
together. Thinkin’ about you was the only thing that kept me goin’ in
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’ve come back to you too many times, Jake. I
can’t afford to believe you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I guess this is our last hurrah then.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I guess so. Did you really read “Moby
Dick?”</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Cover to cover.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: When’s the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: October third.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Your mom and dad like this guy?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You’re still their favorite.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Gonna be a big wedding?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Tom doesn’t like big weddings. You coulda read
Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: At any library.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I mean the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: All Saints on Euclid.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nice church.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nobody. It was Queequeg’s coffin. Am I
invited?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: To the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: If you want. Maybe you really did read it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: This doesn’t change anything, you know. We
were always good at this.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Lynn?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The zipper on your skirt is stuck.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Use your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, my worst fears have been confirmed.
We’re 60 and 60, nine games out of first, and only two out of the first
division. Who do those guys think they are?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Maybe you just have to accept the fact that
they’re not as bad as you’d hoped.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t have to accept anything. Our
attendance is only beginning to rise. If we can force a losing streak
for a week or two, we can still turn this thing around. The fans are
used to losers here. At the first sign of a slump they’ll give up on
this team.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: What’s left to do? You’ve taken away
everything you can.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Not everything.</p>
<p><strong>temple</strong>: Memo says we’ll only be usin’ this for short
trips.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Good thing we don’t play anybody in
Europe.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Can I borrow one of those, man? They don’t
have any magazines on this bus.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sure, go ahead. I think my reading days are
over.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Macbeth. This a good one?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: These are all Hall of Famers.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I’ll trade you Song of Hiawatha for The
Deerslayer.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Naw, I’m not into Song of Hiawatha.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: All right then, how about Crime and
Punishment?</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Yeh, that sounds pretty good. That’s a
detective story, right?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This is it. The Sheffield Arms.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I don’t know if we can survive any more of
these economy measures.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his only
other appearance against the Yankees, will see what he can do with the
Bronx Bombers this time. Vaughn, after a slow start, has come on lately
and now leads the American League in strikeouts with 221.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, jailbird!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon, Rick baby, settle down.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What’s the problem, Rick? You’re throwin’
basketballs up there. That guy in the dugout botherin’ you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Naw, I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget him. Worry about the guys carryin’
bats. C’mon, Ricky, let’s get nasty.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I thought now that Vaughn had some control,
he was ready for the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: Not quite yet.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So, Vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as
the Yankees put together as few squib hits and take a 6-0 lead.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, the Indians made a gallant comeback
today, but fell one run short as the Yankees held on for a 6- 5 victory,
although they didn’t do squat after the first inning. Anyway, if the bus
makes it here from the hotel we’ll be on at 7:30 tomorrow night. Till
then, this is Harry Doyle, saying so long, everybody, and Happy
Hunting.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Mind if I join you?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin’
here?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Just wanted to get out on the road. You
damn near pulled one out today.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Someday we’ll figure out how to beat those
guys.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Ya know, you’ve done a helluva job this
year.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a helluva
job.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: With this club it is.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Ya know, when I first got to camp I figured
this team had no chance. I was just hopin’ we’d win enough that I could
stay on and really start to build something here. But there’s a lotta
talent on this club, Charlie. The veterans are starting to play back to
form and the rookies are developing faster than I thought. There’s two
or three potential all- stars in there. I think we’re a first division
team right now.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You really believe that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I know it. All we need is something to bring
it all together.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: Rachel Phelps would never allow that.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: She doesn’t want you in the first division.
She doesn’t even want you in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I got somethin’ I think you oughta know
about. I wouldn’t have known about it myself if Charlie Donovan hadn’t
told me, although I shoulda guessed it from everything that’s happened.
It seems that Mrs. Phelps doesn’t think too highly of our worth.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: She put this team together because she
thought we’d be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin’ attendance down
to the point where she could move the team to Miami. And get rid of all
of us for better personnel.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Even me?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Even you, Dorn.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: In other words, Phelps thinks we’re all
dinks. That we don’t belong in the big leagues.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: That’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: What if we don’t finish last?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: She’ll replace you with somebody who will.
After this season, you’ll all be sent back to the minors or given your
outright release. So, all we’re gonna get is this one year.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’ve
been playin’ baseball since I was five years old. I’ve had some good
years and some years to forget. I’ve burned out my knees… I don’t think
I have three fingers that work right… I’ve lost most of the money I made
and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time. But I
know one thing… I can still play this game a little. And I’d like to
know who in this room thinks they’re the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is
lookin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, then, I guess there’s only one thing
to do.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Win the whole fuckin’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I figure it’s gonna take 32 more victories to
win this thing. Every time we win, we peel a square.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You remember bra burning in the ’70’s, well,
the newest thing in Cleveland is doormat burning as Indian fans are
standing up and saying “We won’t be stepped on anymore”.</p>
<p><strong>team</strong>: Hello, do you know us?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’re a Major League baseball team, but
since we haven’t won a pennant in thirty years, nobody recognizes us,
not even in our own hometown.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: That’s why we carry the American Express
card. No matter how far out of first we are, it keeps us from getting
shut out at our favorite hotels and restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: So if you’re looking for some big league
clout, apply for the little green home run hitter.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Look what it’s done for us. People still
don’t recognize us, but… …we’re in the first division now.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: The American Express card. Don’t steal home
without it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We interrupt this program to bring you the
following special bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Good evening, everybody. The incredible has
happened. The Indians have finished the regular season in a first place
tie with the New York Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win over the
Tigers in Detroit today. There will be a one-game playoff here in
Cleveland the day after tomorrow to decide the Eastern Division
Championship, the Indians having won the coin flip held just moments ago
in the American League office. We’ll have further details on the news at
11, but for now, get your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Hey, not bad for a has-been and a
never-will-be.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We haven’t won anything yet. We still got
one more to go.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Hey, Taylor, there’s a coupla drop- dead
Annies outside. One of ’em says she used to know you pretty good.
Brunette, great rack…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Darla.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Yeh. What doya say we chat ’em up?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: C’mon, you’re not gonna keep moonin’ over that
library chick, are you? Forget her, she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The Indians are spending the night in
Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning. We’re going to go
back now to Ross Farmer who’s standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the
Indians are staying in Detroit. Ross?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the Indians
are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the
Yankees. Who will start that game is still a matter of some
conjecture.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: You still got that black Corvette? The one
that the sound system took up the whole trunk?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, I had to sell it.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: I thought they gave them to ya.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Not after your knees go bad.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: That’s all right, you’ll be gettin’ a new one
now.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Darla, I don’t think I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: What do you mean? We did this between innings
once.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I guess I’m just not that guy anymore.</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Happens to the best of them sooner or later.
What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna devote a
whole chapter to you in my book.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Excuse me. I was in town for a conference and
thought I’d drop by, but I can see you’re busy…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Lynn, wait…</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you that I’m
startin’ Harris tomorrow against the Yankees, even though it’s your turn
in the rotation.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: He’s got more experience and a little better
record against the Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Yeh, sure. Whatever’s best for the team.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Don’t read anything into it, Rick. You’re one
of the guys that got us here.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Yeh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You mind if I join you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I don’t think I’d be very good company
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Nothin’. Job problem.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I’m, ah, a ball player.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: I know, but that’s not why I came over. I
don’t chase ball players.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Why did you come over then?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Because you’re the sexiest man I’ve ever
laid eyes on, and you look like you could use a… friend.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: I’ve gotta get home.</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I didn’t even get your name.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: Suzanne Dorn?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Mrs. Suzanne Dorn. So long. You’re a great
kid.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Hello, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hello, Suzanne.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Vaughn?</p>
<p><strong>vaughn</strong>: I swear to God I didn’t know who she
was.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Thank you. I didn’t think you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I can’t stay. We gotta get to the park.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Good luck today, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh, you too. Tell me one thing. The night
you came up to my hotel – was there really a library conference?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No, I came to see you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Too bad it didn’t work out better. I just
wanna say I’m sorry for all the things I’ve put you through over the
years.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Even for last night?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Can’t be sorry for that. Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Then you weren’t defending my honor again?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I didn’t have to. She knew she was
outclassed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I wanted to hand in my resignation before you
had a chance to fire me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I know what you been tryin’ to do with this
team. After the season, I want no part of it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, I knew I could count on Charlie to
tell somebody. I was just afraid he might take too long.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Why would you want him to tell somebody?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So you’d tell the team, hopefully getting
them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in
this league. I think it worked.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You tryin’ to make me believe you wanted us
to win all along?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Bullshit. What about the plane, the bus, the
bad hotels…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We were broke. We couldn’t afford anything
better. Donald left the team nearly bankrupt. If we’d had another losing
season, I would have had to sell the team. I knew we couldn’t win with
the team we had, so I decided to bring in new players and see how they’d
do with the proper motivation. There was never any offer from Miami. I
made it all up.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Why should I believe any of this? Now that
we’re winnin’ it’s easy for you to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: If I’d really wanted you to lose, all I had
to do was send the best players back to the minors. But I didn’t, did
I?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You think this was all an accident? I
personally scouted every member of this team, except Hayes, of course.
He was a surprise. They all had flaws which concealed their real talent,
or I wouldn’t have been able to get them. But I knew if anyone could
straighten them out, you could. And if you tell them any of this, I will
fire you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I love this team, Lou. Go get ’em
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know what Dorn’s wife is up to, but
I think it’d be best if you dressed early and got out to the bullpen
before Dorn comes in.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: We got a problem. Cerrano wants some extra
power for tonight. He’s lookin’ to sacrifice a live chicken. We can’t
have people pukin’ in the locker room before the game.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Tell him not to worry, I’ll take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Bye bye, honey, wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Before you go, there’s something I wanta
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>colorman</strong>: Here’s your bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Won’t need it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: You know where Vaughn is?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nope. Haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Let me know if you do. I wanna have a little
talk with him.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: Where’s my chicken?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s comin’ in now.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: One whole chicken, like you said.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: But it no alive.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this. He’s
gotta be gettin’ tired of raw chicken.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding you a
Wahoo welcome from beautiful Municipal Stadium, where tonight before a
capacity crowd of 75,000 screaming featherheads, the braves of the
Cuyahoga will leave their teepees in search of Cleveland’s first League
Championship in over 30 years. Standing in the way, their long time
nemesis, the New York Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway, who have beaten
the Indians like a tom-tom all year long.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All right, guys, let’s take it to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Still nothing – nothing, top of the seventh,
two down. Harris has been in trouble all night, but has battled his way
out with the help of some great defensive plays.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Uh oh, this one’s tagged. Deep center field.
Way back. Way back.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: It’s off the reservation, home run. And the
Yankees lead it 2-0.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the seventh.
The Indians running out of chances.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’ll bring on Cerrano, hitless tonight. As
a matter of fact, he hasn’t touched the ball yet.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Damn, havin’ trouble with the curve ball
again.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: We should’ve gotten him a live chicken.</p>
<p><strong>cerrano</strong>: I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to you, I
stand up for you. If you no help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu. I do it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Long drive, deep centerfield. Way back. It
might be. It could be. The ball is… Downtown, welcome to the Happy
Hunting Ground. The game is tied.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Two down in the top of the ninth, still tied
at 2, Harris working on an eight-hitter.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Activity continues in the pen, as Harris is
really digging himself a hole now. He got the first two hitters, and
then gave up a single and a double and has now gone 3-0 to Cheevers.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: High, ball four and they’re loaded for
Haywood, the biggest Indian killer of them all.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: You pitched a hell of a game, Steve. Take a
seat and we’ll see if we can get this guy for ya.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Give me Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You want Vaughn?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I know he hasn’t done real well against this
guy, but I got a hunch he’s due.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in.
Curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don’t get up with anything.
You listenin’ to me Rick?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: O.K., kid, you’re my man. Let’s go get
him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon Ricky, this guy is the out you been
waitin’ your whole life for.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: O.K. Vaughn has finished his warmup and we’re
ready to…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>dorn</strong>: Let’s cut through the crap. I only got one
thing to say to you. Just rear back and strike this motherfucker
out.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Haywood steps in, the American League triple
crown winner. .341 average, 48 homers, 121 R.B.I.’s. He’s homered the
only two times he’s faced Vaughn.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, Ricky, let’s get nasty.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, looks like the boy is pumped.
Sucker was movin’, wasn’t it? Ever hit ya, it’d leave a two foot hole
comin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let’s see, what should we call now. Let’s
see how he feels about old number one.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow- through.
Keep it up, I’ll show you the ball sometime.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Forget the curveball. Go with the heater.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, shit, all these pitches to choose
from. Maybe we’ll try somethin’ different this time.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And if I don’t see you again, Haywood, have
a nice winter. Okay, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters and the
Yankees are blown down. No runs, two hits, three left on, and, are you
ready, Cleveland? We go to the bottom of the ninth, still tied at
two.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Can you believe this, Monty?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Two down in the ninth, Hayes steps in hitting
.291, trying to get something going for the Tribe.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And Horton is wasting no time. He’s goin’ to
the Duke.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts
per inning and nose hairs.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Ya know I’d be an ass not to pinch- hit for
you here. You’re 0 for 18 against Duke. Plus you’re beat to shit you can
hardly walk, there’s no way you can get around on this guy’s fast ball.
So I want the absolute truth here. Can you beat this guy?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Send Hayes the first pitch. I don’t want
Taylor takin’ too many strikes.</p>
<p><strong>pepper</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Flashing some signals. That’s a hell of an
idea.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What’s this? Taylor is pointing to the
bleachers, calling his shot.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Unbelievable. They’re on their feet here,
stomping, clapping. C’mon, join in wherever you are out there. Let’s
hear you, Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hayes is gonna try to score! Here comes the
throw. He slides. He is…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: …Safe. The Indians win it. The Indians win.
Oh my God, the Indians win it!!</p>
