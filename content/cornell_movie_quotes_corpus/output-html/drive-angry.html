<h1 id="drive-angry">drive-angry</h1>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: Goddamned old man!</p>
<p><strong>fucking passenger</strong>: I thought he was dead! She said
he was dead!</p>
<p><strong>fucking middle</strong>: I don’t see him. Just go. I think we
lost him.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: “The Old Man”, shock of white hair, drives
the Roadrunner, locks the tires and spins the wheel. The Roadrunner
fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM! The truck’s gonna ram the driver’s
side. At least it would</p>
<p><strong>but:</strong>: MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver’s
side window. Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!</p>
<p><strong>“drive angry”</strong>: –then the shot BURSTS through the
title! SHATTERING the words right at us!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: …EXPLODING into the hood of the
Chevy! The hood RIPS up, SLAMS the windshield. Truck CAREENS out of
control! Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck…but… KRAACK - The
Truck nails the Roadrunner’s rear quarter panel. Roadrunner and truck go
into a spin. A tornado of dust SWIRLS around the two vehicles. The
Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front! The Truck HITS a ditch
and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Smoke HISSES from the totalled
Roadrunner. Door creeks open. Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses
toward the Chevy. Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and
rushes Milton, tire iron held high over his head! Milton spins and
KUH-FOOM! –blows Fucking Passenger’s hand clean off! Passenger screams
as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and –</p>
<p><strong>ker-ack!</strong>: – slams it across his face! Passenger
drops. Hard. Milton stoops, removes Passenger’s wallet, digs the cash
out.</p>
<p><strong>over milton’s shoulder</strong>: Fucking Driver scrambles
from behind the wheel, springs to his feet and runs.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: As Fucking Middle drags himself from
the passenger side. He got the worst of it. Looks like his face went
through the windshield. He looks up – – into the barrel of Milton’s
shotgun. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>fucking middle</strong>: I’ll never tell you where they’ve
taken her…NEVER.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I know. The EXPLOSION vaporizes what’s left
of his face.</p>
<p><strong>on fucking driver</strong>: As he tries to stand but his
lower leg dangles from a piece of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the
ground. He looks up at Milton standing over him.</p>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: You…you took my leg you fuck! Milton
presses the shotgun barrel into the man’s good knee.</p>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: Wait. Wait!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: I…I don’t… Suddenly Fucking
Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits up, dazed. Sees Milton.
Spots the iron. Goes for it. Milton spins and KAFOOM! Blows Fucking
Passenger to hell.</p>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
don’t know where exactly. They call it Wolf Deer Run, that’s all I know.
I swear!</p>
<p><strong>fucking driver</strong>: But you’re too late. You gotta know
that. Next full moon she’s dead. Nothing you can do. She’s dead and hell
will walk the earth–</p>
<p><strong>wham!</strong>: Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into
the man’s mouth, breaking a couple teeth in the process. Milton hisses,
his throat dry, like a man who hasn’t quenched his thirst in a
decade.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You tell him I’m coming. You got that? I’m
coming to get her back. You tell him. Tell him I’m gonna kill every last
one of you fuckers. Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and
doesn’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: So I tell him, I says, “Frank, that’s it. No
more free milk. You gonna have to buy the cow you son of a bitch.”</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: But you’re not fat, Piper</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Wha? No, NormaJean, “buy the cow.” Marry me?
He’s got to marry me. I’m sayin I cut him off.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: You cut him off?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Not just yes but hell yes! No tits, no ass.
And I told him if I see that big ol’ dick of his anywhere near my face
I’m gonna bite it in half. Normajean giggles with embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: You said that? How long’s it been? Piper
frowns.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Well, it’s only been two days but that’s like
a decade in horny fucker years.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: So he bought you a diamond?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: A diamond? God no. If Frank had money for a
diamond I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shithole
life in the rear view. But he did get down on his knees and ask me to be
his bride.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Yes way! NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big
hug.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Oh! Piper!</p>
<p><strong>ff-ff-ffump!</strong>: Something yellow peppers them both.
The girls look up as – Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the
window.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Did…did you just throw scrambled eggs at
us?</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: I don’t pay you bitches to stand around.
Now get the fuck back to work! Piper snatches one of the plates. She
delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns toward the newly
arrived customers. The American Indian couple scans a menu… …and Milton
scans her…he quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as –
NormaJean steps up to Milton.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Hello beautiful, coffee?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: That’d be great. Tell me, Stillwater Marsh
around here?</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Stillwater…doesn’t ring a bell. I’ll get
that coffee. But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
She quickly looks away. She knows something… Milton opens his mouth to
speak as– –Piper approaches the American Indian couple.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Hi guys, I’m Piper. Can I bring you something
to drink?</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: We’ll take this.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: “She’s a Brickhouse” breakfast. Ten monster
flapjacks for 4.99.</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: And five waters.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Five waters. And what can I get for… Father
averts his eyes. He’s embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: That’s it. Just the pancakes. If that’s
okay? Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit… they’re
hungry. And broke.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oh. Of course. Coming right up. Piper shoots
Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen. Milton rises slightly. He’s
clearly trying to get Mary’s attention. She’s ignoring him. Piper calls
through the window to Fat Lou.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: One brickhouse. She turns and stops suddenly.
Stares at a pile of muffins kept fresh within a glass cake stand.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Mary can no longer avoid Milton’s
stare.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Stillwater Marsh? You know it? Dale, the
father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: No. We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: You’re in the wrong state.</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: And what state Should I be in? Dale turns,
glares at Milton.</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across. It’s a
two day drive from here.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: And Wolf Deer Run?</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: Never heard of it. The 7 year old LITTLE
GIRL’S eyes brighten.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
that’s where The Smiling Man takes the wicked children to see the Mother
of all things. Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Mother of all things, that sounds very
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Oh it is! The Mother of all things
bleeds black tears unto those who</p>
<p><strong>cut her–</strong>: Mother places her hand over her daughter’s
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: It’s nothing. Just a story parents tell
to their children. Like the boogey-man or the tooth-fairy. A plate
filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper leans in with three
kiddie cups.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: And three milks.</p>
<p><strong>mother mary</strong>: But we didn’t order–</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: –On the house. She winks and moves
away…eyeing the kitchen window. She doesn’t notice…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: staring at her again. An impressed smirk on
his face. Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: So, aren’t you gonna ask what time my
shift ends? Full moon tonight. I’m always a little ‘randy’ during full
moon.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Full moon’s three days off.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: You sure ’bout that, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Pretty sure. Hell of a ride out there.
Yours?</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: The GTO? I wish.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Hers?</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Sure but if you’re lookin’ for a
ride…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: And would you be gentle?</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Life’s too short for that, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: He glares down at her.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: “On the house”? On the fucking house?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oh relax. We gotta toss them muffins out
today anyway. She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Get your hand off of me! His fat fingers
tighten around her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: You get over there and you charge them for
those muff… Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even hear the
CRUNCH. Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
forehead into the bridge of his nose!</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch,
never to touch me again! His nose seeps blood.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: Let…go…of…my… She SLAPS him across the face
with her free hand.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Shut up. She takes a step backwards, but
keeps her hand clamped to his nuts. He has no choice but follow. She
pulls him up to the American Indian family.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Tell’em.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: Wha…what? We see it in her face. She
squeezes. Lou’s eyes go wide…flutter…he’s about to pass out.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Tell them…the muffins…are on the house.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: On. The. House. She lets go. Lou drops to
his knees, then timbers to the floor as Piper turns to the family. The
children are huddled, terrified against their parents.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’m sorry your kids had to see that. Put some
honey butter on those bran muffins and they taste an awful lot better.
Piper turns and crosses toward the door. NormaJean is pale as she
watches her go. Piper brushes past Milton’s booth. His cup is there but
Milton is gone.</p>
<p><strong>ka-thunk.</strong>: She grips the wheel. The RPMS drop.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Car trouble? Piper stares. It’s the way he
said it. Too knowing. Milton glances at the engine.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Oh, that’s not so bad. I can fix that for
you if you like.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I would. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: If you give me a lift.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’m only going as far as Blackfoot Falls. The
truckstop there.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: And I’d be much obliged. Milton leans in,
flicks something then rises and THUMPS the hood shut with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Get it straight old man. I ain’t sleeping
with you. Milton chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten minutes
after I meet her are over.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Yeah. Well, that’s good to hear.</p>
<p>****: For now, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: ’Preciate the ride, ma’am. Milton crosses
toward an old Superman style phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Oh Frank, you know how long I’ve wanted to
feel you inside me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Faster.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Oh, you want it faster? Mona thrusts her
pelvic the tiniest bit faster. Suddenly Piper’s hand clinches a handful
of red hair and yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as
Piper drags Mona backwards off the bed.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: What’s the matter with you?! You psycho bitch
from…</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Don’t. It shuts Mona up. Piper storms back
toward the room.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He
sees her coming. Although he’s a big fella, he looks scared. Suddenly
Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across the face!</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Fuck you, Piper, we’re in lo–</p>
<p><strong>wham!</strong>: Piper clocks Mona! Mona stands there…dazed.
Swaying. Confused.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What was that? I didn’t catch that last
word.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Oh…I…I said…we’re in lo–</p>
<p><strong>wham!</strong>: This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES
into a metal chair on the motel porch. Piper brushes passed her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now baby, just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’m warning you, Frank. Don’t come near
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, sooner you accept this is your fault,
the better. Piper stops, turns, stares.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Baby, I can’t just turn it off. Now you know
that. I gotta have it. At least once a day. It’s in the wiring. You did
this. You made me cheat on you. You’re lucky I’m not more pissed about
it. Piper stares for a moment. It’s like she’s been sucker punched. Then
she zips her bag and crosses to the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Piper! Now cut it out. Enough with the
drama!</p>
<p><strong>the gas station across highway 70</strong>: …the garage. A
grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at Milton, cell phone to his ear.
He sees Milton see him, quickly backs into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Piper!</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: Hey?!</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Pervert. Piper stomps across the lot as Frank
exits, calls to her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we talk about
this? Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Piper, stop this! You got nowhere to go and
you know it.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’ll go to San Francisco and stay with my
cousin.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whoa. You ain’t taking my car. Piper pulls
out the keys, twirls them on her finger.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I said, you ain’t taking my car, bitch. Frank
grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and –</p>
<p><strong>wham!</strong>: – punches him in the face. Caught off guard,
Frank stumbles, nearly goes down.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Your car?! Who’s been making the payments you
out of work, skanky Mona fucking piece of shit?! She drops the gym bag
and launches into him. A blur of FISTS and CLAWS. The tears flow.
Heartbreak, anger, humiliation. Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block
the blows. WHAM!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stop…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …hitting me!</p>
<p><strong>kuh-rack!</strong>: He punches her in the face. Hard. She
drops to her hands and knees. When she looks up, her teeth are caked in
blood.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re insane, you know that? Look what you
made me do! She staggers to her feet, sways before him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, I’ll get you some ice– She SPITS
blood in his face and SWINGS! He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with
the force of thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
she’ll get up this time, then –</p>
<p><strong>quiet laughter</strong>: Frank stares as Piper rolls
over.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Frank. Sweetie. I’m gonna tell everybody what
I caught you doing with my pink dildo. Her laughter becomes a hysterical
fit.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s it. He drops on top of her, his
fingers curl into a fist.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t wanna fuck me? Fine. When I’m done
nobody’s gonna wanna fuck you. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Go to hell. Frank raises his fist into the
air. Then…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Hey. Frank looks up as a boot catches him
under the chin, lifting him off Piper.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: We start close to the ground. Dress
shoes. Suit pants.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure
as shit looks like an accountant in blue suit and purple power tie. Not
especially large. Nice looking face. Something trustworthy about him.
Friendly even. He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it
over his shoulder. There’s a bounce in his step.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Have a seat sweetie. Mary there will be
right with you. Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper’s replacement. She stops
in her tracks. Stares at the Accountant. He winks at her. A shiver runs
through Mother Mary. She backs away then rushes from the diner.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Mary?! Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen
window.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: Where’s she going?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You. Fat fuck. Come here. Lou
stares.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: What did you call me? The Accountant
smiles. Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: I said, what did you call–</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: –I called you ‘fat fuck’ and we had
better leave it at that unless you’d prefer I call you ‘dead fat
fuck.’</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: Wha-what?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m looking for someone. An old man.
White hair. Five-eleven. The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: He was here earlier. Traveling light.
Likely on foot.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m the Accountant.</p>
<p><strong>fat lou</strong>: That’s supposed to mean something to
me?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: It will if I add you to the books. And
if you don’t tell me what I want to know… NormaJean opens her mouth to
speak. Shuts it.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You had something to say?</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: He was here. Earlier.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Yes. We’ve established that.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: Terrible tipper.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m sure he was. Where did he go? She
points.</p>
<p><strong>normajean</strong>: That way. West. On foot.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Want me to roll the window up?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You didn’t kill him did you?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No but he’ll likely piss blood for a day or
two.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Thanks for that.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Hungry? He gestures through the windshield
as they pass a “Welcome to Utah” sign. Beyond, there are lights
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Utah?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You mentioned San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Appreciate what you done for me back there
but I ain’t takin you all the way to–</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: –My business is in Nevada. Can you get me
that far?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m looking for someone. You hungry or not?
Piper considers for a moment, then–</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Yeah. I could eat.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Name’s Milton. You’re Piper, right?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You try to kill me and dump me in the desert
I’ll cut your nuts off.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>greasy fella</strong>: Greetings folks, welcome to the Bull
by the Balls… He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Milton? Roy doesn’t even try to hide his
dislike of Milton.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You hoped I was dead. Not the same.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You planning on staying? Milton eyes a door
marked “Motel Guests”.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Your money’s good as any I‘spect. But be gone
by dawn. With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Back in another life I used to drive a truck
through these parts.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: And you’d spend the night here?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’d spend the night here fucking his wife.
Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I…nothing I guess. A large breasted
waitress, fuckin’ hot for a woman in her fifties, approaches with chips
and salsa. Eyes Milton.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Well, hello. I’m Candy. Start you off with
some drinks?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Same. Candy plops two pens and index cards on
the table.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: And I’ll need to see your IDs. Piper pulls
her license absently and slides it over, begins filling out the
card.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Guess it’s been awhile since you drove that
truck through here.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You want a drink? You gotta be a member. Dry
county.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Welcome to Utah, Mr…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Call me Milton.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: This license isn’t just expired. It’s an
antique.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Fine, then bring me a milk. She tosses his
card on the table.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: For you, gorgeous, we’ll break the rules.
Shhhh, don’t tell nobody. Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You gonna tap that?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Tap what?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Jeez, Milton, how long’s it been? Sounds like
you used to stick it in anything with a crack.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yeah. Well. I’ve been distracted.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Suit yourself. But nobody reaches the end and
says, “Wish I hadn’t fucked so much.” Milton’s gaze returns to Candy.
Even a man as driven as he needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his
look, smiles. Piper slides from the booth.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Where are you…?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’m gonna do my nails, take a hot bath and
sleep in a warm bed.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What about your beer?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You drink it. See you at dawn. But she walks
right passed the “Motel Guests” door and approaches the Busboy, who’s
already eyeing her. As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at
the back of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden beneath his
shirt. There’s an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy
simply adds to his fuckabilty factor. He glances at Milton then –</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: It’s Roy isn’t it? Roy spins from the
bar, smiles a friendly smile.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure is. Get you a drink friend?</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Fantastic place you have here. You don’t
happen to rent it out for parties do you?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: We sure do. You planing a party? Again Jonah
glances at Milton.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>frank tv news</strong>: Mom…Mom…Mom! Would you Reverend Jonah

<p><strong>frank</strong>: I gotta go. Frank clicks his phone shut,
jerks the door open to find – The Accountant smiling at him.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: There was an old man, yes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wha? The Accountant sniffs the air.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: White hair. Angry with attitude.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sumbitch kicked me in the face. Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m the Accountant.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The wha? I called the cops, not a
bean-counter?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: The old man? Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fuck should I know where he went? I woke up
and all three were gone.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: All three?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The bitch, the old man and my car!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: What kind of car?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what, fuck you. You ain’t no cop.
I’m done talking. Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant
grabs his wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room! Frank
doesn’t stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the ground his toes drag
the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite wall and bounces into the
dresser.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You son of a – Frank staggers to his feet.
Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He wipes blood onto the back of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You…you made me bleed. Frank pulls a baseball
bat from behind the dresser.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You leave me no choice but to beat you with
this Louisville Slugger. Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
The Accountant dodges. Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS &amp; GLASS
fly. The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.</p>
<p><strong>slomo</strong>: The short end rips from Frank’s hands, knocks
him backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs there
until… The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
momentum. Frank can only watch as the Accountant -</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: What kind of car?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I…what?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Your car. What kind is it? Frank stares
down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wha…what did you do? The Accountant reaches
out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS out in pain.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A ’67 GTO! Arrgg! The Accountant turns and
walks toward the door. Stops to eye a framed photo of Piper and Frank on
the dresser.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey! Just hold on! The Accountant pivots and
flings the barrel of the bat.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: It’s coming right at his face. Frank
tries to dodge…twists his head…no good. The other end of the broken bat
RAMS through his face, PINS his head to the wall. The words Louisville
Slugger just visible where Frank’s face should be.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Frank Raimi?</p>
<p><strong>trooper #2</strong>: You called about a stolen car? The
Accountant gestures over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: In there. Trooper #1 moves toward the
opened door. The Accountant steps in front of Trooper #2.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m looking for someone. Five- eleven.
White hair. Driving a ’67 GTO. He’s traveling with her. He hands Trooper
#2 the framed photo.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #2</strong>: Excuse me? The Accountant pulls a shiny,
ancient coin, worn from being worried over the years, from his pocket.
He tosses it, the coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2
stares at it. Can’t seem to take his eyes off it. Trooper #1’s eyes
widen as he stares into Frank’s room.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Jesus. He pulls his gun. Points it at
the Accountant.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Keep your hands where I can see
them!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Troopers, this is your lucky day.
Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin. ANGLE - High looking
down on the trio as the coin spins right in front of us - we glimpse the
ancient face in the worn silver - Roman maybe?</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Show us your hands, asshole. What’s the
matter with you?! Draw your weapon!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Here. Look at this. They don’t see a
coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: You’re… you’re a Fed?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: In pursuit of a white haired man. John
Milton. He’s travelling with the girl in this picture. Trooper #1 fixes
his eyes on the photo of Piper &amp; Frank in his partner’s hand. Lowers
his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: But, that guy, in the room. He’s -</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: –Dead. Yes. I’d say it’s unfortunate,
but I’d be lying. World won’t miss him. Look, troopers. I need your help
with my pursuit of this fugitive. If we, we three, can apprehend him…you
are ambitious, correct.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #2</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Yes, we are…</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Wasn’t actually a question. I can tell
you are. Success will mean promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee it. Now we
are going to hunt this Milton, we are going to find the GTO he’s driving
and when we find him, you will shoot to kill. You understand? Shoot. To.
Kill. The Accountant’s voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive. Purposeful.
Promising glory with a hint of damnation.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: That’s against protocol…</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: This man is highly dangerous. He has
killed and will kill again. He must be taken down on sight. The time it
takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your
life. The Accountant crosses to the cruiser’s back door, the coin
disappearing back into his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>busboy</strong>: Uh, are we gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Well, I don’t know, baby. Depends on how well
you do those nails. Now pay attention. You might need to redo that one.
He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her hair up with a
pink bandanna. Candy’s SEX SCREAMS are starting to annoy the fuck out of
her. She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Shut the fuck up in there! Milton twist and
POUNDS the wall right back.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You shut the fuck up! That’s it! Piper
swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn’t prepared and topples
backwards to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oh! Sorry, I didn’t mean… She stops. Stares.
Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.</p>
<p><strong>tv news</strong>: …issued an all points bulletin for Jonah
King’s immediate detention in connection with the murder of a young
married couple in Loveland, Colorado. Their infant girl is believed to
have been abducted by this religious sect. A nation-wide Amber Alert is
now in full effect. Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the
bar. What the fuck? She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of
athletic equipment hangs from the wall.</p>
<p><strong>through window</strong>: Busboy sits on Piper’s bed. Still
naked. He holds her nail polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head
back.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Imbecile.</p>
<p><strong>a noise</strong>: Piper spins, grips the hockey stick. No
one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur… A light GLOWS within
the barn, bleeding through the wood slats. Then… CRREEEEEEEK…barn door
slowly swings open. …revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging
lamp. One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his shoulder. The
third holds a shotgun. The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO
SILHOUETTES step out. Baseball bat and machete.</p>
<p><strong>footsteps</strong>: Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear
around the side of the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle.
Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her. Piper rushes back
inside.</p>
<p><strong>piper’s pov</strong>: LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers.
Work boots. Cowboy boots with a duct tape patch. A door opens. Piper
sucks in breath. More legs appear.</p>
<p><strong>close on guest book</strong>: As a weathered hand comes into
view. A finger traces down to the last two entries. Piper Lee RM 111
John Milton RM 112</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Close’m’close’m’close’m’close. Suddenly
Milton’s head jerks toward the door. His hand shoots beneath his pillow
as– The door BURSTS OPEN! MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into
the room. Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!</p>
<p><strong>kafoom!</strong>: IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH
MACHETE! Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
him as – Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
as – KAFOOM! He’s blown off his feet!</p>
<p><strong>ker-smash!</strong>: The window shatters as a MAN WITH
BASEBALL BAT dives, hits, rolls and comes up swinging! Milton snakes an
arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed with her! As they fall– The bat
SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as –</p>
<p><strong>fwoom!</strong>: The door adjoining Milton and Piper’s room
EXPLODES open at his feet! MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
Milton, presses Candy’s face into his chest, twisting his body to shield
her as his 357 THUNDERS twice! Shotgun’s eye vaporizes in a mist! He
drops to his knees. Man with Axe clutches his throat…blood gushing…turns
and flees back into the adjoining room as –</p>
<p><strong>kuh-fwam!</strong>: The bathroom door flies open!</p>
<p><strong>milton’s pov</strong>: Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots
with duct tape patch appears. Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty
carpet. Milton rolls Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on
the floor. COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can’t see
Milton. Because he’s hidden by the bed.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy with sledge</strong>: Old Man. You know you can’t stop
what’s comin’ That little girl’s as good as dead. TWO BULLETS slide into
the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut. Milton aims under the bed. FIRES! Half the
man’s foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes to the floor! He and
Milton make eye contact beneath the bed…a nanosecond before Sledge
Hammer’s forehead implodes.</p>
<p><strong>a noise</strong>: Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and
raises his head just in time to see–</p>
<p><strong>click. click-click-click</strong>: Sickle smiles, raises the
bladed weapon and–</p>
<p><strong>kur-runch!</strong>: The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a
hockey stick crashes down from above and behind. Sickle drops to the
floor revealing Piper, white knuckling the hockey stick…her face
pale.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad. Milton
stares down into Candy’s face. Her whole body QUAKES…CONVULSES. She
sucks in breath and opens her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Jesus Christ. You’re the best fuck I’ve ever
had. Piper crosses to the adjoining room.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Hello? Do you mind?! We’re… Candy sits up and
suddenly takes in her surroundings. She SCREAMS, wraps herself in a
sheet and flees from the room.</p>
<p><strong>piper’s pov into her room</strong>: Man with Axe is lying
face down in his own blood. Dead. But it’s Busboy who draws Piper’s
attention. Lying beneath blood drenched white sheets. He never saw it
coming.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Aw, hell. Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt
on, rolls Man with Shotgun’s face with his boot. Reloads the 357.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I definitely got their attention.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What. The fuck? You know these people? Milton
flings his duffle over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Come on. There are probably more.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Shhhh. Don’t cry little precious.
FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut. Jonah King turns, freezes. Our two State
Troopers stand near their parked cruiser, staring from Jonah to the
CRYING gym bag. For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A
career maker. News. Media. Leno. Then– The cruiser’s back door opens.
The Accountant steps out. He ignores Jonah King and the crying gym
bag.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Troopers. Remember why we’re here. He
walks by them towards the front door of the bar. Both Troopers turn and
move around the side of building. Jonah King…stares…stunned, he
absentmindedly scratches at the old scar on his face then leaps into the
Sedan with the gym bag, engine ROARS to life.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton, I’m serious! I want some answers!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yeah, we both want some answers. Milton
moves toward the barn as– The State Troopers walk around the bar.
Everyone freezes. The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to
Piper. Recognition.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Aw fuck. Milton grabs Piper, places himself
between she and the Troopers as they go for their guns.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Come on! Milton pulls the 357 and opens
fire! The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
shoot back!</p>
<p><strong>fffump!</strong>: Milton staggers, clutches his side. A
crimson spot spreads across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he
stumbles, falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
spilling from within.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: No! The Troopers keep FIRING! Piper stares
down at Milton’s open duffle. There’s a gun lying within the spilled
clothes. An ancient six shooter. We get just a glimpse, but we can tell
this isn’t just any old gun. There’s detailed inscriptions scrawled into
the metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry. She
reaches for it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No! Not that one. He shoves the 357 toward
her. Piper snatches it without hesitation, rises and –</p>
<p><strong>kupow!</strong>: Trooper #1’s chest EXPLODES. The force spins
him…still firing…he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear! Both men crash to the
ground. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>kafoom!</strong>: The barn doors explode outward as a big
Dodge truck powers toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Have to stop him…</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton! Those cops weren’t trying to arrest
us!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. They weren’t. Get in. Milton climbs
behind the GTO’s wheel.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You gotta patch me up. I’ll drive. Piper
fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: They were trying to kill us!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: They were trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes. Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails
toward the highway–</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: The Accountant steps from the
back door of the bar. Hunter and Hunted glare.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Christ. Piper’s attention is still on the
dead cops.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Christ is right! They start shooting with no
warning?! What are you, a murderer? You escape from prison or something?
The GTO tears onto the highway!</p>
<p><strong>in rearview mirror</strong>: The Accountant just stands
there…fading into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Well?! Which is it?!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Both. Piper raises the gun, points it at
Milton.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What have you gotten me into? I should…I
should…Jesus, I just killed a cop! I’m going to prison. Give me one good
reason I shouldn’t shoot you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Because I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You know what I mean!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: They took my grand-baby. Took my grand-baby
and killed my… He breaks off. Looks away.</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: We see the lighted Amber Alert
sign come into view and quickly blur passed. Piper stares at Milton.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: The little girl on the news? The baby girl
they’re looking for? Milton nods.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: But the news said the baby’s parents were…
Piper stops. Milton’s eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Sons of bitches killed my daughter. Piper
stares. Milton steadies himself.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: So Yeah. I busted out. And I’m gonna get my
grand-baby back. I’m gonna get her back and I’m gonna kill every last
one of the fuckers.</p>
<p>****: You want out, I’ll understand. Piper considers, then –</p>
<p><strong>kuh-fwam!</strong>: They both slam into their seats as the
GTO is rear-ended.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: In the back seat. Now.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Now! Piper scrambles into the back seat as
Milton watches the cruiser pull up along side him.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shotgun. It’s already loaded. Piper digs the
shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the front seat.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Have the other one ready. Not the 357. The
OLD one.</p>
<p><strong>through passenger window</strong>: The cruiser pulls up and
matches the GTO’s speed. After a beat the Accountant turns and smiles at
Milton. Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel through
the passenger window.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: It’s over, Milton. Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Really? What makes you think you have a
choice?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I got something I gotta do first.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Then you should have done it a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I didn’t have to do it a long time ago!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Milton, I will kill that nice woman in
the backseat to get to you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I won’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Again. What makes you think you have a
choice?</p>
<p>****: Now. Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton
snatches it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
hammer with a thunderous…KUH-THUNK.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: This does. The Accountant’s eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>in rearview mirror</strong>: The Cruiser bucks up and over
the guard rail.</p>
<p><strong>ker-frunch!</strong>: And flattens sending out a dusty
shockwave in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Piper! Wait! Milton watches the taillights
vanish over a distant ridge. He starts the engine…then hesitates…</p>
<p><strong>through back window</strong>: Piper approaches the destroyed
guard rail.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: We can just make out the flattened Cruiser
in the light of the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign
of movement. Just flattened metal.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: He’s not one of the ones who took your
granddaughter, is he?</p>
<p><strong>move to reveal</strong>: Milton stands behind her. Shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Someone else.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Is there anyone not trying to kill you?
Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then –</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Come on. I’ll help you. But we’re dealing
with that first? She points to his blood soaked shirt.</p>
<p><strong>close on speedometer</strong>: The needle hovers at 95
mph.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Piper behind the wheel. Milton,
shirtless, his stomach wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun,
reloads.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: My daughter got mixed up with the son of a
bitch right out of college.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: She knew him? She knew Jonah King, the man
they think killed… She stops herself.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: She knew him. The world was in a fuckin
tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution. He places the shotgun
on the dash, grabs the 357.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It was four months before she realized
‘quiet’ meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off
chickens.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Jonah King was into voodoo? Milton reloads
the 357, slowly, methodically.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn’t into.
When she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. Gassed up her
car. Cooked her a hot meal. Then while she slept he broke her leg in
three places with a tire iron.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Jesus. She twists her pink bandanna nervously
in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: She learned her lessen. Was a good little
follower for eighteen months. That’s when they met with some witch
doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown. It was Chinese New Year so the
place was wall to wall slants. She saw her chance, stabbed Jonah in the
face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton. Your daughter was in a cult for two
years and you didn’t know? Why didn’t you help her? Milton grabs the
ancient six shooter. It’s got real weight. His blood-stained fingers run
down the scrolled steel. The gun almost seems alive. Pops the
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I didn’t find out about any of this
until…until I got locked up. Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun
shut. Shoves it into his duffle.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Not gonna reload?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Only had three bullets to begin…</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton.</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: Lights ahead. Several. And road
flares. There’s been an accident. Milton eases the shotgun into his
lap.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: That’s his truck.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Stay put. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>thin old man</strong>: I think he’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Is that right? In a swift move, Milton
RATCHETS a shell into the chamber, drops to one knee, aims into the
cab.</p>
<p><strong>milton’s pov</strong>: The cab is empty. Somewhere near, we
hear a MUFFLED BABY’S CRY.</p>
<p><strong>close on milton’s face</strong>: Realization. Shit. But it’s
too late. A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple.</p>
<p><strong>thin old man</strong>: I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton! Milton rises slowly and takes in the
situation. Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good look
at him. It’s Man with Shovel. Piper’s getting out, doesn’t see Tattooed
Guy until he’s grabbed her. Presses the pistol in her ribs.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Hey! Let me go, fucker! She goes to fight but
Man in Leather Jacket approaches her with an axe. Burly Dude is with
him.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Don’t Piper! Let her go. She’s a pain in the
ass you don’t want. Milton still hasn’t let go of his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>thin old man</strong>: Drop it. Or we’ll gut her. To
emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo Knife from her
purse and smiles a missing toothed smile. Milton drops the shotgun as –
–Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting rifle. Lady in
Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat with nails and spikes
protruding from the end. Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV’s
door. Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
cradles a baby in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Milton, isn’t it? Why are you here? Why
are you making such a fuss?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Isn’t that obvious, you sick fuck? I’m here
for her. Milton gestures toward the baby.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: What’s obvious is that you clearly
abandoned your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: But sacrificing her under the full fuckin
moon, that’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is
unbelievably blessed. Look around. The world’s on fire. Companies own
our governments and the people suffer. Daily. And will continue to
suffer until change comes. And change will come. Thanks to your
granddaughter, Milton. She will open the door to a new world order.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Your BS don’t work on me. You killed my
daughter but I won’t let you kill my grandbaby.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Your daughter’s death was an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No shithead, it wasn’t. I saw the whole damn
thing. I saw who you are when no one’s lookin’. And I saw what that
night cost ya. Jonah’s armor cracks a little as Milton faces the
others.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Milton, you’re embarrassing your–</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: –What was it three or four days before he
showed after killin my little girl? You jerkoffs didn’t notice he was
walking a little stiff? Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business
Woman.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: When’s the last time he shared a bed with
either of you? Before that night, right?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You forced my daughter onto her knees, you
sonofabitch. And she made you pay for it. Jonah stares at Milton in
shock. How does he know?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: But don’t take my word for it. Ask him.
Leather Jacket was there. Jonah made him swear not to tell. Jonah lifts
a .38 auto from within the baby’s blanket and shoots Leather Jacket in
the forehead. Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING. Jonah shoves the
baby into Skanky Gal’s arms then swings the gun toward Milton.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Put the blonde in the RV. Tattooed Guy
shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and Business woman climb in with
the baby. Jonah aims the gun at Milton’s face.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m only gonna make this offer once. Give me
my granddaughter and I’ll let you liv–</p>
<p><strong>kapow!</strong>: He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton’s
head snaps, he falls to the ground on his back.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: No!!! Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the
RV.</p>
<p><strong>business woman</strong>: Please. Try something.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You killed him! You bastard you –</p>
<p><strong>whack!</strong>: Piper’s head rocks back as Business Woman
pistol whips her.</p>
<p><strong>business woman</strong>: Next time I shoot that mouth right
off your face. Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper’s
SOBS rising behind him.</p>
<p><strong>jonah’s pov</strong>: Milton’s body lays there. Unmoving. His
one eye staring skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the
cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind.</p>
<p><strong>milton’s good eye twitches.</strong>: Everyone stares. Did
they just see that right?</p>
<p><strong>the 357 comes up in milton’s hand - fires!</strong>: The
bullet RIPS BURLY’S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back. The others recoil.
Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges Milton with
the ax. MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357!</p>
<p><strong>on gto</strong>: AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger
door.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of
the Station Wagon with the scoped hunting rifle. Aims. BLAM - His shot
rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off. Milton FIRES back with the
shotgun - forcing Man with Wig back behind the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>pov thru scope</strong>: MILTON, face bloody and twisted with
rage.</p>
<p><strong>fu-fump!</strong>: The wheels pound over both of his legs,
SHATTERING them!</p>
<p><strong>matching to:</strong>: A bicycle tire SKIDS to a stop before
us. Then a second.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed
roof, both doors shut. No windows visible. TEEN #1 lights a chillum
pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the pipe, then speaks as only a pothead
can.</p>
<p><strong>teen #1</strong>: Think anyone’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>teen #2</strong>: I guess. Doors is still closed.</p>
<p><strong>teen #1</strong>: Bet it’s sick. Wanna look?</p>
<p><strong>kwu-foom!</strong>: The driver’s side door launches right at
us!</p>
<p><strong>teen #1</strong>: Jesus! The Accountant rolls from the
cruiser, stands, brushes himself off as he strides forward.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Carpenter and despite what you’ve heard,
prefers short hair. Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.</p>
<p><strong>teen #2</strong>: You…you nearly killed me!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Not even close. I won’t see you again
until… He tilts his head, as if reading a sign too far away.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: …until you’re seventy-three. He glances
at Teen #1, then –</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You, I’ll see in three months. And with
that the Accountant turns and strides away.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: A rapidly growing black blotch on the road.
In seconds that blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway,
gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When Jonah speaks…it
is with wonder.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Look at this. He’s still coming.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Who’s still coming?</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: The old man. He’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo and piper</strong>: What? Piper tries to stand.
Business Woman backhands her!</p>
<p><strong>business womam</strong>: Stay down! That’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: You shot him in the face! He can’t–</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Don’t you see? We stand at the
crossroads! Did you think we would just idly change the world? The
forces of evil challenge us! This is wonderful! We show ourselves to be
worthy. I’m so very proud of each one of you. Tattoo and Business Woman
beam. Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby’s face. The kid
goes quiet as – The back glass SHATTERS. Everyone ducks!</p>
<p><strong>kafoom!</strong>: He fires at the RV! He RATCHETS another
shell into the chamber, takes aim then…hesitates…</p>
<p><strong>in rearview</strong>: The front end of a fast approaching
vehicle!</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: The RV pulls off the road to the
left. Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shit! He SLAMS on his brakes.</p>
<p><strong>kafwam!</strong>: What doesn’t explode from the force
KUH-THUMPS as the GTO bucks over her body. Milton grits through the
pain. A bloody angry smile.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: I am patient and forgiving, but that was
wrong of you. He turns to her.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: I’m going to kill you now. And then I’m
going to rape your corpse. So that in the afterlife you might consider
your sin this day. Piper CRACKS her knuckles.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Great. Between now and then. I’m’a fuck you
up. He takes a step and swings a punch.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: The back glass SHATTERS.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Son of a bitch. Milton snatches the 357,
points it out the back glass and opens fire.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: Milton’s POV A white dot spider webs the
Viper’s windshield left.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: Windshield middle!</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: The windshield suddenly turns red from the
inside as a dot appears in front of the driver. The Viper jerks right
drifts off of the dirt path!</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: The RV has pulled ahead and
vanishes over a hilltop. Milton FLOORS it!</p>
<p><strong>shunk!</strong>: Stabs it into Jonah’s shoulder, twists it
deeper in. He SCREAMS. Releasing her!</p>
<p><strong>foom!</strong>: GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the
ground ten feet! The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES! Milton
JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest!</p>
<p><strong>foom!</strong>: The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop…and
passes directly over the top of Milton. Milton’s one good eye zeroes in
on the massive gas tank beneath the back of the car. Milton squeezes the
trigger. The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as – –The Corvette rockets
over the hilltop!</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into
the ground before her! Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as –</p>
<p><strong>ker-fwam!</strong>: She slams into the burning vehicle and
spins out of control!</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Give me the baby and I’ll make the pain go
away. Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: Piper swings out, clinging to
the door for dear life!</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Goodbye, child.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Hey, dickless.</p>
<p><strong>kuh-fwam!</strong>: But before Milton can get his shot off –
The Corvette SLAMS into the back of the GTO! Milton fires! Blowing a
hole in the side of the RV a foot to the right of Jonah’s head! Jonah
leaps back inside the RV. Piper clings on for dear life but she’s
slipping.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: Her head goes buh-bye.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Got ya. Piper nods, crawls toward the
windshield, Milton tries to pull her in as –</p>
<p><strong>kuh-thunk….crunchchchch…</strong>: A horrible sound of
grinding metal roars from beneath the GTO’s hood.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Jesus, Milton. How? She pulls him close…looks
at the back of his head.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s still in there. The bullet. I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: But how…how are you still alive? He stares
back toward the RV. Just a dot on the horizon now.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Ain’t got time to die.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I tried, Milton. I tried to get her back.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I know, baby. I know. Jonah only had about
twenty followers. We hurt him good today.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Fuckin devil worshipers freak me out. They
mess with powers that should be left alone. Turns my shit white.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Powers. It’s all bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: No, Milton. It’s real. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot,
that’s the bullshit. The Devil and demons? Once those doors are opened
you’re fucked. Milton rolls his one good eye. Piper turns back to the
GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I used to know a guy lived out this way. You
got one of them portable phones?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Portable phones? You mean a cell phone? Yeah,
in my bag.</p>
<p><strong>we are close on the cracked earth</strong>: As a hand slams
into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails curl…dig into the ground.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Man With Wig crawls toward us.
He’s pale. Eyes dim.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: He’s crawling toward the Station Wagon.
Someone…somewhere…is HUMMING Wig turns, squints.</p>
<p><strong>a silhouette approaches</strong>: Back lit by the early day
sun. There’s a bounce in his step. Wig holds his hand out to the savior
as– The Accountant’s smiling face becomes clear.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Scorcher today, huh? He takes a big long
swing from an oversized water bottle.</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: Help me…</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Christ on a cracker. My apologies. The
Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into the shade of
the Station Wagon where he flips him around into a sitting position.
Wig’s shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above his left
breast.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: It’s a symbol of our pact with Lord
Satan.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Pact huh? That’s cute. Funny he’s never
mentioned you. Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant
notices.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have some
water. Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Milton’s work I take it?</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: Ran me over with his…how do you…? Who
are you?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m the Accountant. I’m curious. And I
never get curious. What do you people want with Milton?</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: You’re the who? The Accountant smiles,
places his hand around Wig’s clearly shattered femur and squeezes. Wig’s
body convulses! He SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Does it matter? Milton. Why is he
important to you?</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: He isn’t! He’s the one chasing us!</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Why? Wig stares…searches for an answer.
The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig’s body stiffens
and he SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>man with wig</strong>: Because! Because of what we did.
Because of who we took.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Color me curious. What DID you do and
who DID you take?</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Milton sits on the GTO’s hood.
Piper stands between his legs cleaning his wound.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Lemme know if I hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do what you gotta do. You get used to the
pain. Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white skulls
on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton’s head.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: There. That’s better. When she moves aside we
see she’s lined up a skull over his missing eye.</p>
<p><strong>a vehicle approaches.</strong>: Milton slides from the hood,
steps protectively in front of Piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward
them, pulls to the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>pov from approaching vehicle</strong>: From this angle it
looks as though an innocent old man and his granddaughter are having car
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>pov from behind the gto</strong>: From this angle we can see
Milton concealing the shotgun behind him. Piper stands close, her hand
on the handle of the 357 protruding from his waistband.</p>
<p><strong>on wrecker</strong>: As the DRIVER steps out…stands half
hidden by the door as</p>
<p><strong>move to reveal</strong>: Like Piper, the Driver has his right
hand tucked behind his back, wrapped around the handle of a .44
Magnum.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Why does everyone keep saying that?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Because he IS dead. Sure as shit supposed
to be anyway. Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then
–</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I carried your coffin, old man. I was there
the day we put your ass in the ground. Piper stares at Milton. Milton
stares at Webster.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or just
keep stroking it?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That depends. How’s this possible?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You heard about my daughter?</p>
<p>****: I did.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Then you know why I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Back? Back from where? What. The Fuck. Are
you two talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It true they took the little one? Milton
nods. Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Put her in neutral. I’ll pull the truck
around. But Piper can’t tear her eyes away from Milton.</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Sarge! Sarge look at this! Rookie squats to
the ground as SARGE, leather skin, approaches, stares, frowns.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Cigarette butt.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: I see that.</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Sarge! It’s less than twenty feet from the
victims!</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: And less than three feet from the ash bin.
Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred cigarette
butts salute the sky.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Pay attention, Rookie. But Rookie’s attention
has quickly OCD’d elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime
scene. Jeans, cowboy boots, a “Dumbledore Dies On Page 596” sweatshirt.
His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are all
business.</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: You! You can’t be here! Rookie rushes
forward.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Rookie!</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Sarge, this joker can’t just stomp around
the crime scene. Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Captain. Sorry about that. Cap looks up then
stares at Rookie’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: One of yours?</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Yessir, I won’t let it happen again.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Get him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: Cap, he’s green, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: He’s standing on evidence. Rookie leaps back
revealing two shell casings. Cap kneels, stares.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed officer</strong>: Cap! We got a live one.</p>
<p>****: Get me a blanket. And get a medic in here. He turns to Candy,
offers a comforting smile.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: You’re gonna be okay now. I won’t let anything
happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He…he killed them. He killed all of them.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No. You don’t understand, we was fuckin’. He
killed them while we was fuckin’. That’s never happened to me before,
has it happened to you? Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Let’s get a shrink in here too.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Engine’s shot to hell.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Can you fix it? He leans close, hands caress
the engine, searching. Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: Milton stands just through the barn doors,
stokes a fire within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I don’t…how is this possible?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: He loved his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Lots of daddy’s love their daughters, doesn’t
explain shattering reality.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That one loved his little girl enough to
make her hate him. Like Timmy yellin’ at Lassie to go home? Piper looks
even more confused.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You never watched…forget it. Milton was a
bad husband but he was a good father. Used to say it was the only thing
he was ever good at. Then we went and got mixed up with the wrong crowd.
Power and money and once you’re in there ain’t no gettin’ out. So to
keep her safe he vanished the year before she went off to college.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Obviously you got out. Webster glances at
Milton for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: The bastards we were workin’ for, they were
gonna kill us when the job was done.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: So the day before, Milton paid’em a little
visit. He went alone you see. I didn’t know. I would’a gone with him but
I didn’t know. Webster goes very quiet.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Being a daddy wasn’t the only thing Milton
was good at. Sumbitch was good at being a friend.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That fire makin you homesick? Piper and
Webster approach with a six pack.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Cold beer? Milton gazes up at the moon. It
isn’t full but it’s close. The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You know the pain and suffering ain’t the
worse part, right? That’s what they tell ya, what they want you to
believe. But it’s all a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst part’s the goddamn
video feed. Webster and Piper exchange a glance.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It ain’t about the fire and brimstone. Ain’t
about your suffering. It’s about the suffering of them you love. Cuz you
see it. You see it all. In full goddamn detail. And there ain’t nothin
you can do about it. Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL
into the air.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like one of
them tree-huggin piece of shits. Wore sandals. What kind of man wears
fuckin sandals?</p>
<p>****: But I saw how he died. Fought like a fuckin banshee. Milton
goes quiet.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: He loved that daughter of mine. Loved that
little baby too. He kept fightin long after he should’a been dead. But
some people’s better at killin than others. Just how they’re wired.
Milton’s finding it harder to speak.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Then them sons of bitches turned on
my…nosir, physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby
girl…watchin those fuckers…I’m gonna kill’em. I’m gonna kill’em all.
And…and then I’ll be done. Milton finally goes silent. Piper makes a
noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her cheeks. She’s trying not to
sob. Webster looks steely. Determined.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Milton, I can’t fix that car. But I can get
you were you need to be.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Milt, if memory serves you were always
partial to the Nova, yes?</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Yeah, about that fella who killed all
them people at the Bull by the Balls last night. The fella who killed
two of your cops. I know where you can find him.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the
front seat.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What are you doing? Piper pops awake, sits
up. Already angry.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Fuck are you doing?! Milton stares.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Think you were gonna sneak off by yourself?!
Go it alone?!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Uh, no. I need your help. If you’re still
willing. Piper stares for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oh. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Well if I’d known that I would have slept in
a bed!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Mapquest says it’s an eight hour drive and
we got twelve until midnight so we should be fine. And get this, “The
Mother of all things”? “Bleeds black tears unto those who cut her”? Take
a guess what’s really bleeding like a stuck pig from the marsh?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Black tears of oil?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Damn right.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Webster, I need you to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Wha? No. You went alone last time.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m not going alone this time. Piper’s
coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You take that little girl over me?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun.
Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then quickly places an
arm around Webster’s shoulders and walks him out of earshot. Piper
places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares at the two men.
They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods. Milton
returns, slides into the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: He’s not coming?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: He’s too old. He’ll just slow us down. Get
himself killed.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: That’s what you told him?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: That’s what Timmy told Lassie isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Who the fuck is this Timmy and Lassie you two
keep talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: This ain’t gonna be easy, Piper. I need you.
That’s no lie. But are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Just drive the damn car.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I never knew him. Momma said he was a
drifter.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I ain’t your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Fuck you if you are. Milton notices something
in the rear view.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shit. Piper sits up, stares.</p>
<p><strong>through back glass</strong>: There’s a State Trooper’s car
way back there. Fuck. There are two. No lights yet but they are coming
up fast.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Nothing yet. Not until… The lights come
on.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Oh shit. They know.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We can’t stop. Milton mashes the peddle to
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton, this will never work.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’ll work.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: No. It won’t. Nobody gets away anymore. In
fifteen minutes there will be choppers, we’ll be all over the news… She
breaks off. Her mouth drops.</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the
distance we see a police barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line
the roadway in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Just keep driving him to us. We’ll do the rest.
And make sure you peel off before the fireworks. He lowers the handset,
addresses the men.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Gentlemen, these two killed two of our own. I
know you’d like them to pay. Therefore, when I tell you to aim for the
tires, what I mean is aim for their heads. Are we clear? The men nod
with steely determination.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Very good. Please aim for the tires.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Just don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Too many of them.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Just keep driving.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m…I’m sorry I got you into–</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: –They took your granddaughter, Milton, and
now these badge-wearing fuckers are trying to stop you. You crawled out
of the Goddamn abyss…and a few fat-assed county Mounties are giving you
pause? Your grand-baby needs you. Milton nods. Turns back to the
road.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You know what happens to her if they stop
us.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: You lose the last connection you will ever
have to this world. You gotta drive. A scowl crosses his face.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: No. You don’t just drive. Drive angry! Drive
with the motherfuckin’ rage that’ll take us through that motherfuckin’
roadblock!</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: He ain’t stopping.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Good. Makes our job easier. Suddenly a noise
catches them off guard. They turn behind them. Their eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: A Mack Truck RUMBLES over the bridge
approaching from behind them. It’s pulling 80mph at least.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Well…this is unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Uh…what is that?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>ku-fwam!</strong>: The Mack BARRELS THOUGH THE BARRICADE!
Several Cruisers go airborne, sailing directly at us!</p>
<p><strong>through windsheild</strong>: There’s nowhere to go!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shotgun! Piper shoves the shotgun in his
hand. He quickly shoves it out the window and –</p>
<p><strong>through windshield</strong>: We can just make out the
Accountant’s face. He’s smiling.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Hurry! After them! Those men still near,
scramble toward the working vehicles as</p>
<p><strong>scrrreeeech.</strong>: The Mack skids to a stop behind them,
now parallel across the blacktop. Driver’s side angled back at the
bridge. Every gun in the area spins as the driver’s side door opens. The
Accountant steps out, big smile on his face.</p>
<p><strong>sarge</strong>: You want us to shoot out his tires?</p>
<p><strong>on accountant</strong>: As he smiles and flips his coin high
into the air. The surrounding Troopers stare. The Accountant catches it.
Holds it high between thumb and forefinger for all to see.</p>
<p><strong>pov from troopers</strong>: He’s holding an FBI badge in the
air.</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way in God’s
good heaven are you a… The Accountant steps down, thrusting his ‘badge’
into Cap’s face stopping him cold.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Need you boys to stand down. Captain,
you know what this badge means, right? Not a single gun lowers. All
trained at The Accountant. Itching to blow him out of his expensive
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Federal Bureau of get the fuck outta my
way. You boys have blundered into an on-going Federal case. Now, lower
your… He stops, turns…sniffs the air. His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED
TROOPER.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You. ANGLE - Looking down on The
Accountant surrounded by armed angry troopers. He steps from the truck,
nudges Cap aside like he wasn’t there. Cap can’t believe it. Shot
continues, moving down, closer and closer until the Accountant is face
to face with a Young Faced Trooper. The kid keeps his gun aimed,
nervous, excited and confused.</p>
<p><strong>young-faced trooper</strong>: Hey, Hey!!! Cap! And
there…above the kid’s left breast…a pentagram tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: It seems you’re serving two masters. The
kid says nothing stares. Every cop’s gun is sighted on the Accountant.
He doesn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Take out your phone and call him. Call
Jonah King. Tell him the old man is dead. The kid stares until…</p>
<p><strong>cap</strong>: Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent says. Rest
of you. Stand down. Now! Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and
dials.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I don’t think…why aren’t they following us?
Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: They’re likely scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Now we drive.</p>
<p><strong>foom</strong>: A BOOT slams into view.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Stay here. Piper nods. Milton moves toward
the jagged rocks in the distance but soon we can make out the flicking
light of fire ahead as Milton moves toward a cliff’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>close on milton’s face</strong>: He was expecting less than
twenty followers. There are forty down there. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to
the Accountant.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Get away from her.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I shoot you with this, you know what it
means. No heaven. No hell. You cease to exist.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: All the more reason to keep Ms. Piper in
close proximity. You are old, Milton. You might miss again.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: You can’t stop me.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Stop you? Milton, you wouldn’t be here
without me, you ungrateful shit. That roadblock back there, that would
have stopped you. So I want you to drop that iron God- Killer and say
thank you. Milton stares. The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp
flick, suddenly there’s a blade at Piper’s throat. She GASPS.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I said, drop it and thank you. Milton
puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the darkness behind him.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Don’t hurt her. Th-Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: That’s better. He lowers the blade, but
keeps Piper close.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You’re not the first to get out and I
doubt you’ll be the last but I gotta know, HOW did you get out with the
God-Killer?</p>
<p>****: I just walked in and took it.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You did not.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m an old washed up lifer. Never occurred
to’em that I was up to no good.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Wouldn’t wanna be you when he finds
out.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What’s he gonna do? Not let me back in? Now,
I gotta know. Why? Why help me?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I know why. It’s because of those crazy fucks
out there isn’t it? They figured something out didn’t they? Somehow they
know how to summon a piece of hell to earth. The Accountant laughs.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: That’s cute. You haven’t told her?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: She don’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a little
secret. The Dark Lord? Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply the warden of a
very large prison. Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful. Well read. I happen
to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him
greatly.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Then why? Why help me?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Simple. Like the warden, we all have
jobs to do. Getting you here makes my job easier. You get what you want,
I get what I want.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Then help me, now. There are forty of them
down there. You and I could–</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: –No.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: –No. You want to save her then go do it.
If you win, I win. If they take you down, I win. He hugs Piper
closer.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You like butter on your popcorn? It’s
sure to be a grand show. Piper doesn’t know what to say. The Accountant
glances back at Milton.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You’re still here? Milton, the clock is
ticking. Midnight approaches.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Then get off my fuckin car.</p>
<p><strong>high above</strong>: the moon is full and ripe.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: It’s almost time. Skanky Gal nods. But
there is hesitation in her eyes. She’s grown attached to the baby. Jonah
takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: My brothers and sisters, we have come so
far. To this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our
feet. From its death, it shall be reborn. As we will be. We who have
survived the slings. The arrows. The revulsion of those too weak to
believe. We have been cast out. And hunted. But no more. Followers
gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck. Tattoo approaches with an
old rusty knife. It was probably elegant once. Now it is worthless. He
hands it to Jonah. The Followers GASP in holy awe.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: With this sacrifice, no more will we be
shunned. They say the meek will inherit. They LIE. We are not meek. We
are chosen. The hounds of perdition will howl at our command. For now
we… A HOWLING noise. No. An engine. Distant but thunderous. Heads turn.
The sound echoes throughout the ravine then –</p>
<p><strong>fooom!</strong>: The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff’s edge! It
plummets straight at the cultists! They scatter! But three are not so
lucky, they vanish as the giant Chevy turns them to PULP! Jonah’s jaw
drops. This can’t fuckin’ be. Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees
toward one of the giant oil derricks!</p>
<p><strong>kaboom! boom! kuhfwoom!</strong>: He’s shooting Cultists in a
barrel. But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS the
brakes, fishtailing.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Kill him! KILL HIM! Followers produce an
assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the Nova with lead! Milton sights
Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the reverend while he cocks
the pump. JONAH can see Milton’s got him. MILTON grits and pulls the
357’s trigger: Click. Click.</p>
<p><strong>blam!</strong>: Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing
as– Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They fly up
the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from another frontal assault.
Their bodies RIDDLED with lead. The Cultists circle him to get a better
shot. A Magnum is thrust into the driver’s side window - right in
Milton’s face. He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the fucker’s hand.
The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton. Milton twirls the Magnum,
gunslinger style. Jams the barrel into the Cultist’s face and FIRES.
Milton runs down any that get in his way.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: You want to help him.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: He chose you, you know that. Fast car,
spunky attitude. He put your life at risk and you still want to help
him?</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Then go. She rushes toward a goat path
leading down to the valley below. Suddenly something catches her
eye.</p>
<p><strong>close on ground</strong>: The Ancient Revolver. Without the
slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and aims it right at… The
Accountant’s smiling face.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: If I kill you, you can’t take him.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Someone else will come…someone else
always comes. Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from
below.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: Piper, he didn’t steal that gun to kill
me. He stole it to slow me down. He’s getting what he wanted. Now, go to
him. Before it’s too late. Piper turns and scrambles down the goat
path.</p>
<p><strong>control until:</strong>: Jonah BLASTS the front driver’s side
tire, SHREDDING it -</p>
<p><strong>ka-foom!</strong>: Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun
blast!</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Kill him! Jonah and his men open
FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Soon they’ll have a direct shot right
into the Nova’s open driver’s side door.</p>
<p><strong>hey!</strong>: The men spin to find Piper standing behind
them, ancient revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>kafoom!</strong>: Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off
her feet, the gun jerked from her hands. She lands on her back. Hard.
The wind KNOCKED out of her.</p>
<p><strong>kablaaaam!</strong>: The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and
cultists helter skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
JONAH is spattered with his men’s blood, dives behind the wreck of the
Nova.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: Well…this has all gone to shit. He
steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the Nova’s open
driver’s side door.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton
is gone. Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But nothing.
He rushes around the Nova to find… Milton crawling. Bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>milton’s pov</strong>: Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away
beneath an oil derrick. The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he’s won. He places the barrel
of the shotgun to Milton’s chin.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: You lose.</p>
<p>****: Get over here! Skanky continues to cower. Doesn’t budge.</p>
<p><strong>jonah king</strong>: I said get over here! I want him to
watch me kill the kid! Skanky doesn’t move.</p>
<p>****: Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just know I promise to kill her
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>kafoom!</strong>: The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE
FACE! Jonah’s head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless body
into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame. The Accountant
moves away, watching as – The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking
wreck of the Nova.</p>
<p><strong>the gas ignites</strong>: FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to
the heavens - the Nova ROARS one final time, living up to it’s name in a
furious ball of fire that consumes whatever’s left of Jonah King.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire
lighting her face.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton?! He lies on his back several yards
away. Piper rushes up, falls beside him. He’s alive, mouth filled with
blood. She takes his hand.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Skanky Gal looks up to find… …the
Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’m curious. Would you have let him do
it? She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing…</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: That’s what I thought. He turns and
walks away from her.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: See you. Soon. Skanky bolts. Races off
into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton…no… Milton struggles. His head lolls
back and forth. Eyes flick around. Searching.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Where…where is she?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: She’s here. The Accountant hands the
baby to Milton. Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way. He places her in Piper’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Keep her safe.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: I will. Anyone tries to hurt her and I’ll
kill’em.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I know. That’s why I chose you.</p>
<p><strong>a horn blares.</strong>: They all turn toward the high
cliff.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Webster will look after you both. As long as
he can. And he’ll keep trying long after he can’t.</p>
<p><strong>piper</strong>: Milton. This can’t…you can’t just give up.
There’s gotta be something we can do to…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna happen. I’m
askin more than I have a right to. I know it. But love her for me,
Piper. Love her and make her yours. I don’t have any right to ask for
your promise…</p>
<p>****: I promise. Milton. I promise. Milton coughs.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Thank you. And like that. The life fades
from his eyes. Piper holds the baby close, SOBS. She looks up at the
Accountant. But he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>close on milton</strong>: He twitches.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p><strong>move to reveal</strong>: The Accountant stands over him.</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: I’ve seen better. Guess she doesn’t know
you can beat him, slow him, shoot him, even stop him…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: …But you can’t kill a dead man. Milton sits
up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out. The Accountant takes it.
Pulls him to his feet. They turn and walk toward the rising sun. They
walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright yellow glow…then…
…they fade into the shimmering heat… …and they are gone.</p>
