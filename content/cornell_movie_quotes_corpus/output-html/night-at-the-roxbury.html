<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Oh, you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bartender, can I get a beer?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Barkeep, what do you have on tap?</p>

<p><strong>doug</strong>: My man, how ’bout a…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: S’cuse me, partner…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yo, buddy, I was wondering… you know what?
Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, we’re good.</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: Score!</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: What? What’s goin’ on? What’s your
problem?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We got some sweetness on the left.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How you ladies doin’ tonight?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Turn your music down!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah! Just follow us!</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: You’re a big stupid ass!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No. You have beautiful eyes!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I like you too!</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Go home, jerkoff!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay, we’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Guys, this is the Roxbury. No one gets in
unless you’re on the list.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’re on the list.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Names?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Doug Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Steve Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You’re brothers?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: … Yes!</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Quite a joke.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug is hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Yeah, you ever hear this one? You’re not on
the list.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It is. The King of ‘21 Jump Street.’ Richard
Grieco.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Check the wheels.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Check the hottie.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright, we’ll see you later then! You know
what? We’re gonna take off now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe we’ll hang out later.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: There’s no chance of that happening.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know what was wrong with that place.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s hard to say, since we didn’t get in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s just a poorly run operation. They can’t
properly evaluate the incoming clientele.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I thought we just didn’t look cool
enough.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: C’mon. You? You’re a beautiful man. I tell you
what I’d do if it were my club. I would treat all the outside wannabes
just as well as any legendary former television star.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s pretty Roosevelt of you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s just what I believe in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Must be the new dance mix version.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Pull over to the side of the
road!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You know you were doing fifty?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: This is a twenty-five mile an hour
zone.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hottie cop likes you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You think she pulls over anybody? Mave a
move.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Not much, I’m just giving you an
eighty dollar ticket.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She is so into you.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Can I see your license and
registration?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think I got what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She’s calling her friends.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here she comes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How’s my hair?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I want you to do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Whatever you say, TJ Hooker.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Please obey any and all posted speed
limit signs. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s already good, now that you’ve served and
protected me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Way to go, my friend. You got her badge number
plus a month from now you have a date to meet her at the Municipal State
Court. Up top!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Score!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: This is what it’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>security guy</strong>: Folks, we got to keep this area
clear!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There’s a good feeling in here.</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: People, there’s no lingering
by the exits!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug?… Hey, Doug!… Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, it’s Doug.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, hey, Doug. So, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not much. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t know. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s a lot of guys pulling down their
pants, so it’s either the bathroom or the V.I.P room. Meet me back at
the bar. If I don’t make it, I’ll see you tommorow at home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, just hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, anyway, I’m standing there waiting to use
the pay phone…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, he was. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And this guy who’s on the phone turns around
and tips his hat like this.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And who do you think the guy was?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Emilio Estevez.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The Mighty Duckman. Swear to God. I was
there.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Of course, you were. You’re the one who yelled
the breakfast clubber’s name.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I was like – ‘Emilioooo!’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, anyway… you guys want to make out or
what?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Score some chippage. I’ll meet you in
there.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, she’s totally looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ask her where the chips are.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, I know where they are.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Excuse me, I’m looking for the potato chips.
You know, chips made out of potato.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: They’re right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wow, you really know what’s going on, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, look.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: … Hey.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Remember us? We were at the Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We were outside?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Could I get a pack of Marlboro
Lights and that 12-pack of Trojans. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, I think I’m gonna need a 12- pack of
Trojans over there.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: You know, they expire in two years.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That nabob has got it going on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Kickin’ it at the Roxbury, rollin’ a banana
Ferrari.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tasty geisha by his side.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The man is a bag of chips.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: All that and a bag of chips.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Right. Well, we’re doing okay. I got a number
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let me see it!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: 555…? Steve, this isn’t real. It’s one of
those fake T.V. numbers.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Is not.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Is, too. I get this number all the time.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: At least she respected me enough to write a
fake number. We’ll get a real one one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: One of these days? Steve, don’t you get it?
These are our days. Now! Today! Ahora!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ah whatta?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, we’re young. We’re supposed to purge
ourselves of the party virus or we’ll just get so clogged up that when
we’re like forty we’ll just explode.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, like one of those individual plastic
butters you get in the diner. You know, like when you squish it, just
bursts out all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Forget the butter, Steve. I’m trying to
explain –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Or like when you put an egg in a microwave
and all the yellow stuff flies out.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s an exceptional way to visualize it but
listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh! Remember in camp when we put that can of
beans in the fire?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And it exploded. Yes. Steve! If we’re ever
going to live up to our full potential, we’ve got to get this partying
out of our systems now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Alright, let’s do it! Do it! Woo!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Do what? Everything’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Then let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s go home! Wooo!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey! Knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Twizzled you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, you totally got me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That was in my nose.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Captain! Tenille! Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Look at this. Barbara, look who’s
honoring us with their presence.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Ma!… come on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Mom, I’m trying to get my body to enter the
zone, so I can optimize my fat-burning potential, and orange juice does
not help!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, according to ‘Fit for Life’ the idea of
a balanced breakfast is a fallacy. Your body is only prepared to accept
one form of food in the A.M. – fruit.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You can putrefy your insides if you want to.
But, I’m having a cup of cooked oatmeal, one tablespoon protein
power…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … and four soy sausage links. That’s how you
hit your peak.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Quick, Barbara, look at Doug. He is
hitting his peak. You don’t want to miss this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Honey, if you’re going to hit your
peak, do it in your room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: All I want for breakfast is some sliced
mangos and persimmons.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: That’s enough, you two. Your mother is
not the maid.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, can you tell the maid I want some sliced
mangos and persimmons?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: I want you both at work in half an hour.
And, Steve wear something nice. Emily’s back from school.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Excuse me, Dad, but I think you’re confusing
Steve for someone who gives a flying rat’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wow, a flying rat’s ass. That would be wild
to see.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Kamehl, they’ll be there. Just let them
have their breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Sure. Eat. They need their strength so
they can stay out all night for their dancing and their orgies.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: For your information, Dad, Doug and I were
not able to find an orgy last night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Barbara, explain something to me. They
graduate from high school and what do they do? Nothing. Do they go to
college? No. Do they take any intrest in my business? No. Do they think
about the future? No.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, if you know all the answers, why do you
keep asking the questions?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Half an hour. I want to see your dance
club asses at the store.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Jerks.</p>
<p><strong>cappucino salesman</strong>: Single or double?</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: Double.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Good. Steve, you have a customer. Doug,
go ring that man up.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How will you be paying for this? Cash, check
or charge?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Charge.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Visa, Mastercard, or Discover?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Move your thumb.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh… Visa. Good one.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I think something’s wrong with your card. You
sure this is yours? ’Cause it’s not processing.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s my card.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I better call it in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Operator 238 please.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Authorization. Card
number?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Doug, I told you not to call
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I got to get an approval.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: The card’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not the card, sweetness. Me.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Shut up and swipe it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I can go for that.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … that feel good? ’Cause I could swipe it all
night.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: It’s fine. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … Oh, can I help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Excuse me, may I show you around the Silk
Garden. Home of a wondrous variety of flora and fauna – all made of
silk.</p>
<p><strong>customer #1</strong>: Are these supposed to be ferns?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s what people will say. But guess
what?</p>
<p><strong>customer #1</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … it’s not real. It’s silk. Oh, be
careful!</p>
<p><strong>customer #1</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’ve accidentally wandered into the
Enchanted Forest. Allow me to be your guide.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know what I just did?</p>
<p><strong>customer #3</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I just watered your plant for a whole
year.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s up? You want to dance? With you. Oh,
God, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: You don’t spend enough time in dance
clubs? You have to cut up my plants, and make toys of them?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: This club had a jungle theme.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Carlos! Come work the cash register. You
get your brother and load the truck.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Steve! Steve!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t look!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, I guess you’re back from school and
working in the lamp store again.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah, I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Pardon me. I got to talk to my brother a
second.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What, do you like her or something?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Then why are you talking to her?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, look at me. It is your destiny to be
with a variety of lady girls. Not just one lamp store troll. And quite
frankly, your level of looks is way above her level of looks. So for her
own good, just walk away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You are so smart.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: So, Steve, you gonna ask me out ’cause I
think we could have a really good time…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, that sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Back off, chicklet!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: What’s your problem. Doug?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Emily, I don’t know if you know this, but my
brother and I? We live life in the fast lane. That means no stop signs,
no red lights, and no pulling over to take pictures. Now you see this
man over here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He’s my co-pilot on this magic carpet ride.
It’s a two-man operation. One – two – – crowd.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Shut up, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sh! I just don’t want you to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Emily!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Hi, Mr. Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: You know my son, Steve, here, likes
you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Dad, come on!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mr. Butabi, is Steve asking Emily to marry him
again? Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Ha, ha, with the way they carry on, I
think they’re already planning their honeymoon, Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ha. Ha. Did I tell you? I’ve already booked a
wedding band.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Ha. Ha. Yes, and if they have enough
grandchildren we won’t have to hire salesmen anymore. Ha, ha, ha…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Kamehl, you kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: No, you kill me. You murder me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … salesmen. That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, can you just leave Steve alone?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: What? Your brother likes the girl.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, nothing personal, but Emily’s like a
pigwoman from a planet of pig people. And she’s trying to take Steve on
her porky little spaceship so she can take him back to the Planet
Pig!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on the Pig
Planet? Bacon and sausage.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nice call.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Every once in a while I’ll hit pay dirt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: This is all too bad, because that girl
is going to be his wife.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, they could also eat ham.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Enough of pig talk. Doug, do you see
this wall? When they marry, we can knock it down. Then combine stores
and have the first plant/lamp store. And Steve and Emily can run it and
it’s up to them if they want to keep you around.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Are you seeing planes? Is your name Tatu?
Because I think you’re living on Fantasy Island.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: God, that was a sweet show.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yes, I have a fantasy. That I have two
capable sons who listen to me. Look how you load the truck. You’ve done
enough damage for one day. Get out of here. I’m sick of both of you!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, we’re on a break?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You want to Crunch it?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, I’ll Crunch.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s up, Stacey?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Patty, work it.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ritchie, you’re the man.</p>
<p><strong>ritchie</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tom-meee!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Excuse me, can the rest of us use the
mirror?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How’s my form?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Looking good. Relax the shoulders… breathe
through it… lift don’t swing… feel the burn… stitch in time… and let me
hear this one…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Aaaaaaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sweet pump. Got some veinage going.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ask me what time it is.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But I know what time it is.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hotties.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh… Excuse me, do you know what time it
is?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, Let me check my watch.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I… think it’s… quarter three.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ladies love triceps.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Doug! Steve! What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Craig!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Looking large, gentlemen. You guys want the
rest of my power bar?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, we got a Nitro bar.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: How ’bout an Energy Booster Bar?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, we got a Muscle Triplicator Bar.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Okay, but let me know if you need some carbs.
I got a case of ‘carbolicious’ in the back. But supplements aside, can I
get some quality time with you fellas?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’re in between sets. Lay it on.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: How long we been friends?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: All seven years of high school.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s right. That’s why I got to be real
with you now. And I’m not gonna sugar coat it. As a professional
trainer, I’m a little worried about your pecs. You guys don’t go all the
way down. It’s called full extension. And I’m not seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Craig, you’re right. We actually had a long
talk about that the other night.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I just don’t want you to cheat yourselves.
I’m sorry I had to come down on you like this, but in a weird way,
that’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, that’s why we love you and we hate
you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Still friends?</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m glad we had this talk.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, we don’t talk, we do.</p>
<p><strong>aerobics teacher</strong>: Okay, everybody, I’m Shelley. Are
you ready to Cardio-Funk?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No!… Yes!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, man, you are hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>aerobics teacher</strong>: Okay! Here comes the countdown!
Three… two… one!</p>
<p><strong>aerobics teacher</strong>: … and kick!</p>
<p><strong>aerobics teacher</strong>: … and reach.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cardio-funk!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thank you, Shelley!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: … what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Should we go back to work?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We shaked it, let’s bake it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, I told Dad we should put some ferns
and some silk banana trees in front of the store. ’Cause then passersby
and the like could see ’em and we could attract more customers.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Moonwalk that by me again?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I just said I was talking to Dad about the
store and…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The store? You’re sitting around thinking
about the store?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s where we work.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s right. And is that all you want to do
with your life? Is that all you think we’re capable of doing –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Want to go for a swim or what?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … about quarter after… five</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: – capable of doing with our lives!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Doug, why are you Mt. St. Helensing on
me?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Because I want more for you. I care about
you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That is so sweet of you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I know. And you deserve better. You deserve to
get into the Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, there’s a list. You have to be like a
Richard Grieco type guy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type guys. We
should be on that list. We’re ‘A’ club people leading a ‘B’ club
life.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’ve been going to ‘B’ Clubs? Why didn’t you
ever tell me this?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I didn’t want to hurt your feelings. I know
how sensitive you are.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: ‘Cause we settle. ’Cause we keep going to all
those ’B’ clubs ever night They can smell ‘B’ club on us like barf in a
bathroom. From now on, the only club we go to is the Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, how –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: But, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We can’t –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We can. And we will. Because no matter how
many lists and roped off areas the big bouncer in the sky throws in
front of us, we will get through. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re good-looking?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Very good-looking. You especially. Now, repeat
after me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘After me.’ Sorry. I’m just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And it was hysterical. I’m just not laughing
to preserve the drama of the previous moment.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Understood. Continue.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Repeat after me. We can get in the
Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We can get into the Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: Roxbury! Roxbury! Roxbury!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: … And then, and I swear this is true,
someone came into the store today and thought it was a real plant
store.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: I would not kid about that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: The Andersons here. Get dressed and come
join us.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve! Sorry, Dad, we’re busy tonight.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I like your bathing suit, Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks Emily.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, again!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I mean, whatever, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nice to see you, folks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Excuse me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: If I tell you to do something, you do
it. And what is this business of coming in naked. Put on your pants and
come down.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ain’t on our ‘Things to do’ list. Daddy-o.
Steve and I have something extremely important to do tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yes, to come downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Why can I not get through to him?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. You just
keep putting things in, face down, and you need to have a cover page,
because if you don’t – people don’t know where it’s coming from and
sometimes you don’t get through on the first call. That’s why you got a
redial button and a memory button because… you know… actually, I never
use those buttons. I always screw it up. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t try to explain it to him. He’ll never
understand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Oh, I understand. You are going out
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: I just don’t understand what you’re
driving.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Hey! Dad! What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: ‘Memories, all alone in the moonlight…’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You can take away our phones. You can take
away our keys. But, you can’t take away our dreams!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s right. ’Cause we’re like sleeping when
we have them.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Later much.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Emily, nice voice.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Boys! Boys!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: I don’t like you going out without a
phone. What if something happens?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ma, these are embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Take it in case of emergency.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Did Ma get lipstick on me?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, but it looks like you were making
out.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, how’s my hair?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Looks good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Roxbury good?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know it. How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Robust and attractive. I gotta tell you –
tonight, I can taste it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I can’t taste it, Doug! I can’t! I’m so
scared right now I don’t know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bro, you’re mad cowing on me. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m nervous, man. We’ve put all this pressure
on ourselves to get into the Roxbury, and I don’t know if we can
deliver!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You gotta take control of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, you gotta take control! I am barely
hanging on here!… You…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whoa… settle down… relax… think puppies and
candy canes… easy…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How you doing, little lady?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright. Maybe later then.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and I hate
to be the one to burst it. I just don’t think our names are on that
list.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, get real. The bouncer isn’t checking a
list. He’s checking us. Man, I can’t believe all this time, that’s what
you thought.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, why didn’t we ever get in before?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We were kids. We were completely immature.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But that was last night. And now we don’t
even have our car.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Perfect. Rites of passage. Like that Africa
show on P.B.S. When it’s time for a boy to become a man, they send him
to the jungle with nothing but a spear to hunt the lion The van is our
spear and the Roxbury is our lion. And when the hunt is over, we shall
be men.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Does the bouncer know about this?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, Steve, what really matters is that at
the end of the night – when all is said and done and all hotties have
been hit upon – if either of us has just one girl’s number, just one,
then we’ll know, for the first time in our lives, we’re really worth
something.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Storm the castle.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Take no prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, my good hombre, remember us from last
night?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug and Steve Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You’re brothers?</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: No… Yes!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Works every time.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Now, I remember. You can’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, it’s time to play a little softball.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hello, my good man. How’s it going
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Good. You’re still not getting in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, that’s not what a good friends of mine
told me. Maybe you know him? His name is Abraham.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You don’t know him?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How ’bout his two friends? George Washington
and… George Washington?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let’s not forget the other boy in the band,
Mr. Hamilton. He’s a little lonely, wants to join his buddies.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wait up, look what we got here…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, Lincoln…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: …Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
and a commemorative coin – ’84 Olympics – what a proud chapter in
Angelino history.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s one!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s not an A.T.M. That’s where you drop
off your videos.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Wait, there’s one!</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Oh, shit! The car.</p>
<p><strong>blonde model</strong>: Car? What about me?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: No, this car is illegal. All I need
is a police report.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: It’s a racing car. I imported it
illegally.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let me see…</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Ah, great. They’re starting in with
the neck injuries. I’m screwed.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Hey, sorry about your car.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No way. Richard Grieco!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Remember, we saw you last night?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Like Walt Disney says, my man, ‘It’s a small
world after it all.’</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: So, are you guys alright?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My neck hurts.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Right, so, what do you want to
do?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We were just going to the Roxbury again.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But we couldn’t get in.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Hey, you guys want me to get you in
the Roxbury?</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Great. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: See? It all comes from within. And he felt it.
Because he’s an actor and he’s very sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Put in ‘D’ and blast me.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: We got to make a stop at the
Roxbury.</p>
<p><strong>blonde model</strong>: What about the party?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: I don’t want a lawsuit, okay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, keep it together. Think F-R-A. Focus,
rhythm, attitude.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Got it… Fra.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Mr. Grieco. Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: I got two.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s right. We’re with Richard Grieco.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s right. Grieco!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh my God, Doug, this is the most amazing
place I’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Hey guys! This is the coat room. The
club’s in here.</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: …Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whats’ up?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s up?… What’s up, what’s up, whats’ up,
what’s up, what’s up…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve! Get a hold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry, it’s hottie overload in here.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Pace yourself.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … What’s up?… two, three… What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Richard, my man! Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Benny. Place is kickin’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Actually, it’s jumping. Like ‘21 Jump
Street,’ right? Ha! My children watch the reruns on T.V. land. Who are
your friends?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir. He owns
this place. These are uh..</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Doug Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Steve Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Let me show you my V.I.P. table.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh my God! The owner.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He’s the man who pulls the strings. The
Gepetto of party.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Plus, he’s the owner.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sh! Listen and learn, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Yes! I see you! Excuse me, I have to say
hello to Bob Saget.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: So, you guys come here a lot?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, we’re never been inside.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, what are you saying, be cool. So, is
Johnny Depp meeting you here or what?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: No. So you guys look like you really
know how to party.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, yeah, we never stop.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re pretty much out of control.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: I get it, Bob, the club is crowded, so
it’s a ‘Full House’ like your show. He’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Benny, we’ll see you at the party.
I’ll see you guys.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: See ya. Richard Grieco!</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Their necks looked alright,
right?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sir, I just want to say, and I mean this with
the utmost sincerity, it is an honor to shoot the shit with the owner of
the club of all clubs.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, and we’re proficient club hoppers – so
we know what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I mean, we usually go this place called ‘The
Palace’ and that place is rank. The music is ancient.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, no celeb citings and the women are
oinkers.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And they let any asswad in the door. It’s the
worst.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: I own that place also.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, but it’s a really good location.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And the drinks are reasonably priced.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: No, no. You are right. That’s what’s
wrong with this club business. One day you are hot next day you are not.
People get bored easily.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, you know I had this great idea. You
should make this place like a tropical jungle.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, lots of silk plants and vines.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, but they’re not real vines. They’re
bungee cords and people could like swing from one end to the other so if
you left your friends at the bar, you could get back to them.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, and the barmaids could wear loincloths
– but tasteful. Like the ones they wear in strip clubs.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: You could not insure bungee cords. People
jumping back and forth. Too expensive.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay. Hit delete on that one. Doug, tell him
about your street idea.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I was just thinking, you know how people get
bummed waiting outside to get in the club.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is good. You’re gonna love this.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, you make the outside of the club look
like the inside. You know, you put down a rug outside and some couches
and pipe out some music. People will love it. But, then on the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, this is the good part.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … Looks like the street. You know, you park
some cars inside, a mailbox, street signs, and that way when they come
in, it’s like the outside is the inside and inside is the outside.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doesn’t that blow your mind?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: It hurts my brain to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: What about that guy?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: He owns a restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Uch. How’d he get in?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: … Look, I don’t see anything over six
figures… So, let’s just go.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Wait a second. That’s that Zadir guy.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Too bad he’s married. He owns all the clubs
in town. Plus, dry cleaners, that beeper service, and Mailboxes,
Etc…</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Who are those guys with him?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: I can’t find them, but if they’re with Zadir,
they’ve got to be worth something.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Great. Let’s work.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert gottfried</strong>: Oh my God! Benny! Benny! Benny!
Benny!</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert gottfried</strong>: You have to say hello to my
friend at the other table. Not this table. No. No. The other one. Looks
like this table – other people around it. I have a friends and he needs
you to say hello to him at the other table.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: You have a friend?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert gottfried</strong>: Oh my God! You got me! I didn’t
see it coming. No. It was coming but I was not able to see it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: I better go before he explodes.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Was I too pushy? I was too pushy. Did I speak
well?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You were totally articulate.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe he didn’t like our ideas. It’s hard to
pitch in a night club. You ever notice, the music is blasting in here.
We should try to get a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, Steve, what if we…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Up what’s? You want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, she said ‘Yes.’</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hotties want to shake it, come on.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Hey, guys! Over here.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bro, you are incredible!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Seriously, unbelievable stuff out there. So,
you want to hang out?</p>
<p><strong>john travolta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Alright, catch you later then.</p>
<p><strong>john travolta</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Wow, 1980, good year!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, ’80 was an excellent year. Devo had a big
hit that year.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, and ‘Joanie loves Chachie’ started that
year.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That was just a cheap spinoff.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That was a spinoff?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Of course, those characters originated on
‘Happy Days.’</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I did not know that.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Sure, ‘Joanie Loves Chachi.’ But, does Chachi
give a Fuck about Joanie?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Cambi makes a good point. But tonight we
should have fun, not dwell on Scott Baio.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dom Perignon’s good but you know what really
makes a party – Redi Whip.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But not like when you put it on stuff. It’s
when you’re half pressing on that little white nozzle and like before it
comes out, you suck on it, and it’s really fun.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: You mean like nitrous oxide? Whippets?</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: … No!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tscha! What is that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Dooey! We must stop and get Redi
Whip!</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But it has to be Redi Whip in a can!</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Wait, he can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I was just saying it has to be Redi Whip in a
can.</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He really can’t hear us?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dooey, tell your mother I had a really good
time last night!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And your father!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I mean your sister!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good one.</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Mr. Zadir, I’m pulling over here to get
whipped cream.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Operator 238, please… What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Hello, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Guess where we went tonight?</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Let me see, the 7-11 on
Ventura?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, I mean, before this, you sly little credit
vixen.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The Roxbury with Richard Grieco and Bob Saget.
You gotta come out sometime.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: I would. But then there’d be
no one to approve all the money you spend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re always thinking of me.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: The card’s good. ’Bye,
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She approved.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. For a guy who
owns sleazy night clubs, the decor in your house is quite tasteful.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good one.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Excuse us, we’re going to the ladies’
room.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Anna Nicole! Put something on! You are
making us sick!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Do you feel it, Steve? We are finally
experiencing the party lifestyle to the fullest degree. Let’s
mingle.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How’s it hanging? You want to mingle?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cool party, huh?</p>
<p><strong>model guy</strong>: … I guess.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, I’d say it’s kicking into gear right
about…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … now.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>model guy</strong>: I’m a model.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, right. So are we.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s a hard job.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, you know, like you got to stand still
all the time and uh…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Standing still. Standing still is really
hard. My foot cramps sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>model guy</strong>: I know what you mean. What agency you
with? Elite, Ford?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, do you like mingling?</p>
<p><strong>model guy</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: See you on the shoot!</p>
<p><strong>naked woman</strong>: Can you pass me a towel, please?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … about eight o’clock, eight fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>naked woman</strong>: They’re right behind you. Can you just
reach over?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sagittarius.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: BMW.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right off Sunset.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vanilla mostly.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Look at this, I have the Spice Girls, yet
nobody is dancing.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: With all due party-throwing respect, you know
what the problem is, Mr. Zadir? This pool is taking up all the prime
dancing real estate.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, you know, if there were a big piece of
glass you could put over the pool, you could use it as a dance floor.
And it would be really sweet because people would feel like they were
dancing on water.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And you could put fish in the water and it
would be like the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Or, Doug, you know what would be another
amazing idea? You could have a special room for people who want to dance
naked.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Plus, then you could have a room next to that
room with a one-way mirror so other people could watch them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Boys, boys, please let’s not talk
business. We’ll schedule a meeting for this.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: We got scared.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Of who? We’ll kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: No, we got scared someone stole you away from
us.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh… Like some other girls would steal us
away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, right… Oh!</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we borrowed them
for a while?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: … No! Got you!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good one, Mr. Zadir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He totally got me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Mr. Zadir, let me just say that you, sir, are
a load and a half.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Thank you, Doug!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: … Oh, oh, here she comes…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Watch out, boy, she’ll chew you up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Whoa, here she comes…</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: She’s a maneater!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Guess who that was?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, I was supposed to have a moustache.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Sonny and Cher?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay, we’ll give you another hint.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s a rich girl.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And she’s going to go far ’cause she knows it
doesn’t matter anyway.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Guys, guys! I have an idea. You want to have
some fun?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, fun is our last name.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Plus, fun spelled backwards is ‘nuf.’ And you
can never have ‘nuf’ fun.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Great. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: They’re staying in here. And we’re going in
there.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Nice room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, it’s great. Doug, you should check out
this room!</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: I think he’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m just a big believer in sharing.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Steve, why don’t you come over here?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Viv, you know what I heard when I first met
you?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s an ambulance. Coming to take me away
because the sight of you just stopped my heart.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, Cambi, can I ask you something? Do you
like blueberries or strawberries?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cambi</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I want to know what type of pancakes to order
you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know, I was wondering… Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I was wondering…</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Checking your label. Just as I thought. Made
in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Doug, you’ve gotten past the opening
line.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: ’Cause I can see myself in your pants.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Hey, Doug, if I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And this guy on the phone turns around and he
tips his hat like this.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And who do you think the guy was?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And Steve was like ‘Emilioooo!’</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Emilioooo!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Emilioooo! And it was really him.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Is this your first time?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What? Oh my God. That is hilarious. That is so
hilarious! Steve, did you hear that? You don’t even know how funny that
is. You are funny. You don’t even know how funny you are! Man!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vivica, I’ve been thinking. Our relationship
is really going strong now. We’ve had some great times together that
I’ll never forget. Remember when I saw you at the pool?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, I was just remembering back. You know, an
open dialogue is an essential element to any successful long term
relationship. I think we have something special going on here and I
don’t want to move too fast.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Is this your first time?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yes. Isn’t it yours?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh my God! Did you just? ’Cause I just!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: This is historical! This what it’s all about!
Up Top!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not that it hasn’t happened before.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I mean it was alright.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The usual.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m gonna go back in the –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Me, too. I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, Steve?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That was great.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know. Are we A club people now?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You got a number! Wooo!</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Woo! We got a number!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Where have you been? We’ve got to get ready
for our business meeting with Mr. Zadir?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I got some great new supplies for our
business.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘Post Its’ to annotate important documents.
‘Little Post Its’ ‘cause you write smaller than me. ’While you were out’
pads – for while you are out. Scotch tape, in case the Post Its lose
their adhesive-osity. And mugs with our names on them. Yours says,
‘Doug.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Did you call Mr. Zadir?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, before you talk to a man like
Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully developed plan of attack. You have
to have all your ducks in row.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I didn’t know to get ducks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s an expression.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, we’re going back to the dance club
idea?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah. Now you set up the office. I’m gonna
call some real estate people to talk about locations. At that point, I’d
like to schedule a meeting. Can you do tweleve thirty.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m clear.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great. Be prepared to discuss possible club
names and themes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What about music?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’ll have to schedule another meeting for
that. Hey, you know what? Maybe we should have a pre- meeting to
brainstorm before our scheduled meeting.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. That way we won’t look like idiots at
our meeting.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Exactly. Okay, I’m gonna roll a few calls. We
should order in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I can take care of that. Ma!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, Steve?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I was just thinking. Dad would really be proud
of us right now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: Boys, your father’s furious. You were
supposed to be at work an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright, we’re gonna have to do some
re-scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, hello, I’m interested in your sound
systems. I’ve heard good things about your woofers and tweeters.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, I…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m on a call.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Mr. Butabi, where is the other cash
register?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: I’ll be with you in a second,
Mrs. Manicotti.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: One second, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: It’s good to see you’re on a break. I
mean, after all, you’ve been here almost twenty minutes now and it’s
hard work listening to your walking man and ringing up the one customer
you’ve had.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, I’m sensing a note of sarcasm.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: This is a very nice sign. Except for one
thing. This is the only register! This is why I pay you – to push a
button and take the money. Is that too much? Is there some problem I
don’t know about? Did you injure your button pushing finger in a bad
cell phone accident?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, why don’t you go to Rexall’s Drug Store.
I think you need to purchase a bottle of chill pills.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Just when I thought I had you doing the
absolute minimum, you astound me with how much less you can do.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: For your information, Dad, we are working our
asses off.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, our week’s filling up pretty quick.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad, last night, Steve and I happen to have
made a very important business contact.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Oh, what are you dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Did you want me to go the drug store to get
those pills?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I think we should tell him now. Dad, you’re
gonna love this. We’re working on this club idea which could include
many silk plant opportunities and guess who we thought could be our
supplier?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yes, I need you to give me
opportunities. I feed you, I clothe you, I put a roof over your head and
I pay for your little phones so you can call other idiots. I give up on
you two. I am ashamed to call you my sons.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There you go again, Dad. You always tell us to
do something with our lives and when we finally do, what happens? You
got to put us down. You never support us, you never encourage us, and
you never care about what’s important to us. Right, Steve?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you need a prescription for those
pills?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: It’s my own fault. I spoil you. From now
on, you are no longer allowed to go out to clubs at night.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Now enough wasting time. Go clean up the
stock room.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know what, Poppason, not only will Steve
and I not clean the stock room, but we are officially out of here! Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But what about the stock room?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We quit! And we don’t need you! We made big
contacts last night!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, plus we met these girls, Dad, and you
wouldn’t believe what happened.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’re gonna make it without you. You’ll
see.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yes, I’ll see tonight when you get
hungry and you come home to eat my food. And when you come crawling to
me for more money!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Hey, Steve! Do you want to go to the beach
later? I’ve got my bathing suit on under this.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not now!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I’m not talking to you, Doug. You’re an
ass.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Emily, we’re experiencing a major family
crisis. I’m gonna have to take a rain check on this convo.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve! Car!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nice bulbs, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: So, you want to go out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, these are the ideas we’ll pitch him. The
Jungle Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Killer.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The Inside Out Club.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That one needs work.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah. We’ll hold off on that one. And let’s
not forget our ace in the hole – The Naked Room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think we should call it ‘The Nudist
Colony.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That sounds like a strip club. And this is a
dance club.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re right. We’ll go with ‘The Naked
Room.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Zadir’s gonna be excited to see us. This is
it, bro…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘This is it, make your mistakes where you
are. This is it…’</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: ‘… We’re going no further.’</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘Here! The moment is now, no place for
goodbyes…’</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: ‘And now I’m not so sure… doo doo… deep in
my heart…’</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve/intercom</strong>: This is it!</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: You guys know ‘Footloose’?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Actually, we’re here to see Mr. Zadir. It’s
Steve and Doug Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘… pick up your Sunday shoes…’</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Mr. Zadir’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We were supposed to have a meeting with him
about our ideas. Like there’s one where the inside is outside and
there’s one about a jungle and…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve! Never talk concepts with the intercom.
Can we come inside and wait for him?</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Can we leave him a message?</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s just forget it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Stay strong, sailor. Do you know where we can
find him?</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: He’s at the office in Wilshire.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: … ‘Everybody cut, everybody cut… doo
doo.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, Steve, did you notice we forgot to ask
her something?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You mean, ‘What’s up?’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah. That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Actually, it’s not. We’re both involved in
serious relationships now, and our ladies know they can trust us.
‘Trust’ being the key element in any worthwhile commitment.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Why go out for burgers when we’ve got steak at
home?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re right. We should get lunch after
this.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. Zadir.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You’re brothers?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ma’am, thanks for the setup, but we really
can’t get into that right now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, Mr. Zadir!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hey, you can’t…!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I’m in
a serious relationship right now.</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Dooey! My very main man. Up top!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, Dooey, how’s everything goin’?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ragin’ party last night.</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Yeah, is that what my mother said to you… …
or was it my father?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, Zadir wants to have this meeting by the
elevators?</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit last
night. I was out till four in the morning trying to find more.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: From dusk ’til dawn – you, sir, are a party
animal.</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Don’t go near Mr. Zadir. He was drunk last
night and he doesn’t even remember you. You think you’re the first
losers he’s picked up that I’ve had to get rid of come Monday?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Uh… Doo-man, I don’t know if I’m reading my
diss-meter correctly. Because are we being blown off.</p>
<p><strong>dooey</strong>: Just stay away if you know what’s good for
you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Alright, so we’ll see you guys later.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I can’t talk to you right now. Give me a
second.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe we should just go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, and maybe we should just go to college
and not put gel in our hair and starts wearing blue jeans. Let’s do
that, Steve!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cambi’s number.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We had a sweet time last night, didn’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sweet ass time.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Diabetic. I could see doing that again, maybe
even a couple a times a week, right?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The ladies await, my friend. Cell!</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Yeah, I think it’s great how you get to
travel around the world.</p>
<p><strong>akiro</strong>: These hotties are sweet.</p>
<p><strong>toronaga</strong>: Sweet ass.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: I don’t know. It’s just a bunch of pound
signs.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m not sure you’re doing it right.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve, you have to hit the pound sign or it
doesn’t go through. Maybe their phones aren’t working.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Try putting in our number and then hitting
pound.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Bill Nye the Science Guy.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Cambi. It’s your boyfriend. I need to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Uh… well, I’m at the Skybar.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Be right there… sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How’s my hair?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Long-term relationship good?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s totally committed. You know, Doug, when
things aren’t going so well, it really makes you realize how much your
woman means to you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: These guys bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Hi, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You guys messing with our women.</p>
<p><strong>japanese guys</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You want to mix it up? Come on! Take me on.
I’m insane. You don’t know what you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vivica, I’m feeling a little vulnerable here.
I thought we had an understanding. And I can’t believe you’re willing to
just throw away everything we’ve been to each other?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and Toronaga…
they’re my cousins.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh! Well, it’s about time that we met the
family.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come on! What do you think, we’re stupid? How
can they be your cousins?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Well, his mother and my mother are sisters
and that makes us cousins.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Would you excuse us a second?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, we just got to talk to them a
second.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, ’cause we slept with them last night
so…</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: So, did you guys have as good a time last
night as we did?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I had a great time, Vivica. In fact, I think
we’ve reached the point where I can comfortably call you ‘Viv’ and leave
out the ‘Ica.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, you guys want to hang out or see a movie
or do what we did last night… or eat or… just do what we did last night
or hang out, eat and then do what we did last night or… you know,
whatever… and do what we did last night.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Viv, I’m glad our relationship is strong
enough to withstand the hard times – like when were just in the bar – I
also think we’re not just projecting onto one another but dealing with
the reality of who we are. And most important, we know how to
listen.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Hey, you boys want to go somewhere quiet?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>doug/steve</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s gold. I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ladies, have your boarding passes ready.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Aisle or window seat? I’m sorry, ma’am,
you’re gonna have to check that bag… The movie on this flight will be
uh… I don’t know. I can’t think of any more.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Our dad got mad and took it away.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Your dad?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, we used to work for him, but we quit
today so actually we’re unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: You’re not in business with Mr. Zadir?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, we are. But, not now. We just met him
last night. But, we will be. So, no, but, yes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Especially, if we ever get to see him
again.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, we were just kidding about those
boarding passes. You can get in.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Get away from us.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: You guys are a big waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … Como what?</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: Steve, you’re a jerkoff.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, I’m glad you shared that with me.
That’s a big step for the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Guys, consider what we did with you last
night a favor. Now do us a favor and never talk to us again!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What did we do wrong? We’ll change.</p>
<p><strong>vivica</strong>: No, you can’t change. You and your brother
are ugly pathetic losers. That’s the problem with nightclubs. Poor
schmucks look just the same as rich schmucks.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: I can’t believe we actually had sex with
those asswads. I hope the nips are still at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Doug, I think some of the plants are
beginning to wilt… no, I’m just kidding. They’re made out of silk.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … ‘This is it.’</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Steve! This is the worst day of my life. So,
if you don’t mind, I really don’t want to hear you talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, it hasn’t been the Super Bowl for me
either… … just trying to get you to talk.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Talk?! You want me to talk, Steve?! I’ll talk.
Blah-blah-blah, talk, talk, talk! I’m talking! You feel better now?!
Talk!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t really know how to respond to
that.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, big surprise, Steve. You don’t know how to
do something. You don’t know how to work the clubs, you don’t know how
to talk to women. The only thing you know how to do is ask me how to do
everything!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, I –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s why everthing’s gone wrong… ’cause
you’re holding me back.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re so needy all the time. You’re like this
thing tied to my leg, like this… dragging thing…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: A lead weight?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, a lead weight. Thanks. And I am not
letting you drag me down anymore.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … You know, can’t blame me for what happened.
Today was a series of random events gone awry.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe events wouldn’t go awry if I had someone
with a brain sitting next to me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I’d have better events
if I was with someone with a higher level of looks and taller.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m tall enough to kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Did you say something? It’s hard to hear
things that low down to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well hear this. Consider me your
ex-brother.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You care about this?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You want the real thing?!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Then stop talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Lies! All lies!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s right, ma’am. It’s silk. It’ll always
be in bloom. It’ll never change. It’ll never die. It’ll never yell at
you and call you a ‘loser.’ It’ll always be in your room where you left
it, not suddenly move out into the guest house.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: What are you doing? All the customers
are depressed.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m just used to seeing Doug at the register.
I miss him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: But he’s only in the guest house. It’s
ten feet away. It’s like a mansion in there.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There’s no cable.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: There is Cinemax.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, there’s no H.B.O.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Nine… ten.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Okay. One more set. Add ten pounds.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Whoops. Sorry. Wrong pin.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Not the neck – the stomach. Not the thighs –
the stomach. Not the shoulders - the… Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Ab citing! Six pack in full effect.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Where!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: There she cuts.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Hi, Steve. Is that an ab?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Toned and tight, Emily. Want to power up?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I heard about your brother.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’d you hear about him?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Your father said you and him quit, then you
had a fight, then you came crawling back to work like he said you would
and how your brother didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: So, when are we going out?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know a place with good spinach wraps?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look, Emily, I know you’ve had your heart set
on this a long time, but, the truth is we’re from two different worlds.
I mean, I’m a rebel… and you’re kind of the sweet girl next door
type.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Steve, I work next door. It’s not a type,
it’s a location.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know what I mean. I don’t know if you can
handle a guy like me. I’m used to more, like experienced women.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Duh. You’re forgetting – I got to college.
Translation – drunken orgies with occasional Cliff Notes.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know Cliff. Weak delts.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: And I’m not one of those date rape
crybabies.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look, it sounds good, but I’m getting over a
very serious relationship right now. It’s gonna take some time to nurse
my emotional wounds. And that could take, like, until Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Perfect, your dad bought us two tickets to
David Copperfield, this Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ll let you know how I’m feeling.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: It’ll be fun to see things appear, and then
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tight glutes. Steve, as a trainer. I’m pretty
perceptive about picking up body language… I think she likes you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … Fine! I won’t watch Larry Sanders!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Here’s one – ‘Business Computer Systems.’</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m not real good with machines. That was
Doug’s thing. I’m more of a people person.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Steve, a businessman has to have a knowledge
of computers. Ooo! – ‘Venture Management and Analysis.’ you have to take
that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, my dad’s giving me the store
anyway. I don’t really have to go back to school.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: One store? Yah… and maybe we’ll just have
like one house and one car. Steve, we’re gonna have more than one store.
And you have to be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t really want to go back to school.
I’ll have to read.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And homework and teachers always asking you
if you’d like to share that with the rest of the class.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Don’t upset me. Unless you want to make me
less horny.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, that wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Look, first, we combine the stores, plants
and lamps, then we can add furniture, you know recliners…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: … sofas and tables and… and…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … chairs?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Oh, yes! Chairs and wastepaper baskets and…
and…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ah!… Ottomans!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: And then we’ll open a second store in Orange
County with dinette sets and entertainment centers, and a third in San
Francisco and then we’ll be bigger than Ikea, oh my God… Home Depot! I,
I, Ikeaaa!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Emily, I’m sort of feeling, you know, like
we’re moving too fast. You’re talking like we’re married.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Oh my God! Steve! You’ve made me so
happy!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What? No, no. I meant…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Oookay.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Doug, If I’m not mistaken, this place has got
it going on. I owe you big time for inviting me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Wooooo! Who wants to dance all night long!
And I mean aaall night! Wooo! Doug, I am having a hell of a time!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whatever, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey, do you think I should wear this outfit
to your brother’s wedding?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Your brother’s wedding? What are you gonna
wear?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You got to hand it to Steve. That Emily’s the
perfect woman. Strong legs, low body fat, and a positive mental
attitude. A lady like that can really keep you on track. Is it okay to
wear black at an afternoon affair?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Shut up, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Doug, I know you and your brother are having
some problems, but that is no reason to refer to my intellectual
capacity in a diminutive manner.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m sorry, Craig, but you totally Wolf
Blitzerd me with the matrimony update. Do you mind if we just don’t talk
about my brother?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Ten-Four. Boundary set.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, did we come here for some Starbucks’
latte chitchat or did we come here to hit on hotties?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hotties.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, sweetness, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, fine thing, you got it going on.</p>
<p><strong>ellen degeneres</strong>: Thank you. I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, you want to shake it?</p>
<p><strong>ellen degeneres</strong>: No, I think I’ll just let it
sit.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>ellen degeneres</strong>: Now that I’ve met you, I’m more
sure than I’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That was a… … close encounter.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She’ll be back. Just playing hard to get.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I am having a hell of a time! Wooo!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butabi</strong>: And the hors d’oeuvers are hummus dip
and babaganoush…</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Who’s going to eat that? You should have pigs
in the blanket and chicken fingers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Okay. A toast to Steve and Emily, who
after tommorow will be Mr. and Mrs. Steve Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Emily Anderson-Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Really. Okay. Well… to whoever they turn
out to be.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I would also like to thank everyone for flying
in to join us. My brother and his wife from Chicago. My parents who came
in all the way from Maine despite Mom’s sciatica. And the Butabis who
came all the way in from Yee- men.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yemen.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wherever the hell that is. I’m just kidding.
And that’s not the only union I’m excited about. From what I understand,
we got a new lamp/plant store.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: That’s plant/lamp store. Ha ha… that’s a
joke. But, seriously, I think it sounds better.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Steve, don’t you want to make a toast?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, that’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: All the men are doing it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So, okay, uh… I just want to say… what’s up…
Grandpa, Grandma, and those other two old people.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I think what Steve means, is that, we’re just
thrilled with the way this family is coming together. And I’d like to
share with you some of our business plans for after the merger. Can you
pass these out?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: I will get more wine.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could cancel
this whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Yes, sure… … Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Dad, that’s so funny. But I really don’t want
to get married.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: You are serious? All these people are
here and you are serious?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Dad, it’s like, Emily had turned into this
whole different person. I mean, at first, she was this girl that I
really liked to have sex with. Then she turned into this other girl who
I really don’t want to marry – although I don’t mind having sex with
her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Look, the catering is paid for. The
tents are all set up. Your grandparents flew half way around the world.
Besides, all men go through the same thing the night before their
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You mean, all guys feel sort of nervous and
anxious, and kind of hope a train hits her and she eats a can of
botulism or maybe she could hang out with a deer, and a hunter
accidently shoots her or you know, when she’s sleeping and she makes
that nose whistle sound and you shake her to make it quiet but what
you’d really like to do is take her stupid red toothbrush and ram it up
her nostril into her skull.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Steve, these feelings are perfectly
normal.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug? Doug? You there?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’ve reached Doug Butabi. I’m not home right
now – because I’m…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … out living it up, unlike my pussywhipped
brother who’s busy throwing his life away and will spend the rest of his
years selling silk plants for Emillyyy… … Beeeep.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug, sorry I missed you. I guess you heard
I’m gettng married tommorow. I was just wondering if you wanted to be my
best man. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Craig, I know you can lift it. Now can you
just listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I got it. I walk down the aisle. I stand next
to you. And I settle any inter-wedding party skirmishes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, you’re the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just gotta back me up.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh, you mean like spotting you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Now, I get it. If things get too heavy, I
step in. Like a relationship spotter. Thank you, man. I won’t let you
down.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Okay, boys, we’re about ready to
start. You look very nice, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thank you, Father. I love what you’re wearing
also.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, Dad, I’ve been thinking. I didn’t
really have time to have a bachelor party and that’s a pretty important
part of the marriage experience. So, we may want to consider delaying
the wedding a couple of hours so we can go to a strip club or
something.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Sh! We’re starting.</p>
<p><strong>bridesmaid</strong>: Richard Grieco? How do you know
Steve?</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Look, I just don’t want to be
sued.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Alright… it’s a long walk… pace yourself.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Grandma, you look unbelievable! Woo!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s up? You from out of town?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: See you at the reception.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Steve! Getting married! Go for it! You are
the man!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Shut up, Craig! I’m walking down the aisle,
you dick!</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today, to join together…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Father? Did we already start?</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh. Sorry I thought there was going to be a
buzzer or whistle or something.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: … To join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show any just cause why
these two should not be lawfully joined together, speak now or forever
hold his peace.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I am having a hell of a time!</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Very good. Now I understand the
bride and groom have each prepared something.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Dear Steve, today I wear this wedding gown,
and on my face there is no frown. I know our lives together will be
great, just like when we saw David Copperfield on our first date. If you
set something free and it comes back, you should love it forever, and
like one of your silk plants, I’ll try to stay beautiful, that is my
endeavor. Love, forever, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Emily, I used to see you outside my father’s
store. And then we went out on some dates and you let me have sex with
you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Very nice. Steven, do you promise to love
Emily, comfort her, honor her, in sickness and in health, as long as you
both shall live?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My father already paid the caterer.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Emily, do you promise to comfort
Steve, and honor him in sickness and health, as long as you both shall
live?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Now, Steven, repeat after me…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: ‘After me’… just kidding. I’m nervous.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Now repeat after me, with this ring
I thee wed…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: With this ring, I thee wed.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Now, Emily, repeat after me. With
this ring, I thee wed.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: With This ring –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Doug.</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Let’s just keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Mr. Butabi, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Just ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>father williams</strong>: Say ‘With this ring I thee…’</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: With this ring –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry, Dad. Emily, I’m sorry. I’m not ready
yet. I liked your poem.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best man, my
primary duty is to allow the groom to beat a hasty retreat should the
occasion take a sudden ugly turn.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Don’t test me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I’m a keen
observer of human nature. And, I can tell that neither of your sons are
anywhere near the maturity level necessary for this sort of
commitment.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Go ahead, Father.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Emily, with all due respect to Steve, his
discipline is lacking as is his appreciation for you. I, on the other
hand, can bench press 305 lbs. I squat a clean 525, and my body fat
percentage is less than two percent. Not only am I a professional
trainer, but I someday hope to market my own protein bars and produce an
Iron Buns video.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: … Okay… We should look into infomercials.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: … and I also took Craig out clubbing.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That was alright. Plus, I rented a lot of
videos and I didn’t do much else.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, I, uh, I don’t know… I just… Steve?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, I’m sorry. I said a lot of bad things
before and… lately… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ve been thinking, you know… You’re my
brother… we’re brothers and when we’re together, you know… You just…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You don’t drag me down, Steve… I drag me down,
me! And you… you complete me!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Shut up. Just shut up! You had me at
hello.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: And it seems to me that you’re a
little bit harder on Doug than you are on Steve. Isn’t that true?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: You are right. It’s just that Doug is so
rebellious, so hard to control.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: Rebellious? Scrappy? Dreamer, maybe?
What other young man does that remind you of?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: … Myself.</p>
<p><strong>richard grieco</strong>: So who are you really fighting
with?</p>
<p><strong>mr. butabi</strong>: Oh, Richard Grieco, you see right
through me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I missed this car. I look good in it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Of course you do, bro.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know it… Oh… And… you know, you look good
also.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks, bro. I’m glad you moved back in the
room.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Dad was kind of a sport about the wedding once
Richard Grieco talked to him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, and isn’t it a kick in the head how
Emily hooked up with Craig.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s funny. The infomercial really makes you
want to buy those Power Bars.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That silhouette chick is hot.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, look…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We got to remember to tape them.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert gottfried</strong>: Yes! Yes, we’re in flight! Yes!
No! No, that’s down. We don’t want from down. We want up! Yes! Up is
good!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, I wonder whatever happened to Vivica’s
cousins?</p>
<p><strong>akiro</strong>: Kiyamo tomaga.</p>
<p><strong>toronaga</strong>: Kayama, Tokayama! Ko ma sayagan a
suma.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose</strong>: “SHUT UP, JUST SHUT UP.:YOU HAD ME AT
HELLO”</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, get in the other lane, there’s an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wow, I can’t believe all that stuff got
wrapped up in one day.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, check it out…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wait a second, that was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It was killer. Bound to happen.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Whoa! No one gets in unless they talk to
the list.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right. Well we’re on the list.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Steve and Doug Butabi.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Butabi… Great. Step right in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Go right in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Okaaay.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I guess we should go in then.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Boys!</p>
<p><strong>steve/doug</strong>: Mr. Zadir!</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: How do you lke our place?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Our place?</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: Yes, I cut you in. It was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sweet ass sweet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. zadir</strong>: It’s not all sweet asses. Running a club
is a lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Mr. Zadir, we’ve got a situation at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’ll take care of it, Mr. Zadir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re on the job.</p>
<p><strong>cambi</strong>: Call the manager then! We’re always on the
