<h1 id="liar-liar">liar-liar</h1>
<p><strong>ms. berry</strong>: “Work.” Today we’re going to share what
our parents do for work.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My dad is a truck driver.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: My mommy is a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: My dad is a librarian and my mom is a
vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>theodore</strong>: My father is a struck-sher-al-
engine-ear.</p>
<p><strong>craig -</strong>: My mother is an actress. She works at
Denny’s.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: My daddy works at a place where they make
stuff, and my mommy is a mommy.</p>
<p>****: My father is a postal worker.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My mom’s a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ms. berry</strong>: And your dad?</p>
<p>****: My dad? He’s . . . a liar.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well… he wears a suit and goes to court and
talks to the judge and–</p>
<p>****: Oh! I see– you mean he’s a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: A dark street. . . a stormy night… two
desperate men struggle… one man is taken to the hospital, the other to
ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case
of a poor man, brutally victimized.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, for once I agree with t he
prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case – but the true victim is my
client.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Put yourself in his shoes for a
moment–walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the
suburbs.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You’re nervous, timid, looking over your
shoulder – when suddenly, you encounter him– pouncing from the shadows.
You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his
hand– a knife?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: And in that terrifying instant you do what
any respectable citizen would – you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you
shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it’s all a mistake… the
man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of
metal caused by his bank card.</p>
<p>****: As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially
still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help.
First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi
ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to
notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man’s Lexus to
head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a
sigh of relief: “Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!” But do
the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No– they
arrest you and throw you in the slammer!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: � And why? Why does the State turn its
massive power against this individual?</p>
<p><strong>impressive</strong>: moment, then answers his own</p>
<p>****: Discrimination,</p>
<p>****: But this time it’s not based on race.</p>
<p>****: Not based on gender. Not based on religion,</p>
<p>****: No–this time it’s discrimination based on size! wants you to
think - - i t ’ s always the big guy’s fault. Is that what we’ve come to
as a society – persecuting people because they’re large?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on
you!</p>
<p>****: The state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of
Justice. Only you can douse the flames. The decision is your s. And
please…don’t let your emotions run away with y ou . The fact that my
client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of
their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Instead, let cold reason be your guide as
you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: How’s it going, Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Another gratifying day serving
Justice.</p>
<p><strong>client</strong>: Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was
some way I could show my appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Stay out of my neighborhood after
dark.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Mr. Reid, do you have a � moment-?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No, I’m late picking up my son.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: -Because a couple of reporters want to
interview you about your big win today.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher ..</strong>: How’s my hair?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p>****: I ’ m sure he just got tied up in court again.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Maximillian!</p>
<p><strong>transformers!! .</strong>: Fletcher instantly becomes a human
version of the TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max
knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . … Until –
.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Malfunction in vector 3 ! ! Malfunction in
vector 3!! Look out! It’s on tickle mode!!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: And who is this lovely lady? Max, could
you introduce me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s no lady, that’s mom!</p>
<p><strong>audrey. �</strong>: Thanks, Max.</p>
<p><strong>� fletcher</strong>: Mom? !</p>
<p>****: Himnm. . . I don’t remember her looking that good, Malfunction
in Vector 4! Malfunction in Vector 4!</p>
<p>****: Keep Vector 4 away from me. Unless you want Vector 4 chopped
off.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You know, you were much easier when we
were married… So where are you off too?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Stanford. I’m delivering a paper.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on
a bike.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey mom, dad’s taking me to see wrestling!</p>
<p>****: Oh, Fletcher!</p>
<p>****: Oh, Audrey!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Do you have to take him to tho se things?
They’re so violent.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher/dan george</strong>: The boy must learn the way of
the war rior . An d wh o be tter to teach him than Rowdy Rod- . Piper
and Big John Stud?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher/dan george</strong>: He must be schooled in the way
of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple. For only
then–</p>
<p>****: Shut up!!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher/dan george</strong>: The squaw will never understand
us.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Max, my man!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fletcher, good to see you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What? No kiss for me?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What do you say, Max? Give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I didn’t know the boyfriend was going.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Jerry. His name is Jerry and yes, he’s
going.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean
you two are…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’ve been seeing him seven months, what do
you think?</p>
<p><strong>fletgher</strong>: I was hoping that after being married to
me, you’d have no more strength left.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: . Well you have to remember when</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: MEDIC!! I’ve been hit.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, great… I’m so happy for you two. I
am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry’s
taking that job offer in Boston.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Aud, I am so sorry…</p>
<p>****: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yo u gonna be okay? Because if not, we
could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does
that appeal to you at all?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend,
Max.</p>
<p>****: You drive.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dad, are we really going to go to
wrestling?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Absolutely, Maxattacker. We just have to
stop by the office for one minute.</p>
<p><strong>konigsberg.</strong>: As they head inside, Fletcher and Max
pass a BEGGAR.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: ’Scuse me, sir. Do you have any change?</p>
<p>****: ’Fraid not. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Fletcher!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Philip!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: And this must be Max!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: . Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You know, Ethel and I had a blast at our
last little get- together.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, me too. I can never get enough of
charades. We’ll have to do it again sometime.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: How ’bout tonight?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Not that soon. I’m taking Max to see
wrestling–</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: We love wrestling. We could–</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t think so. See, Max is really shy
around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tell you what – give me your card as a
reminder. I’ll call y o u . Soon. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi, Mr. Reid.</p>
<p>****: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Fabulous! I love it.</p>
<p>****: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know who sent it. But it’s for
Mr. Allan. It’s his anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ah… The Partnership Committee meeting
still scheduled for Friday?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yep…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, I’m… fixing the card, Look, they
spelled Mr. Allan’s name wrong. Have an apple.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>m iranda</strong>: Fred, it’s your duty to present the
strongest case possible.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The strongest case possible, consistent with
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Let the Judge decide what’s true. That’s
what he gets paid for. You get paid to win.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: If you insist on my taking it to trial, I’ll
represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda – I won’t
lie.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Then we’ll just have to find someone
who’will.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hey, Pete! Great tie! �.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Thomas–looks like you’re losin’

<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, yeah. You’re going to love it. Uh, why
don’t you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone,
have a good time. We’ll be leaving in a second.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Damn! I completely forgot.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Oh, there’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You’re a saint. I should get you
something.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing.
Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: . Let’s see.. . �</p>
<p>****: Judge Patterson’s clerk. He needs your filing.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tell him it’s in the mail.</p>
<p>****: Right. You’ll do it next week. Mr. McKinley phoned, questioning
that fourteen hours you billed on Christinas Eve.</p>

looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: As if I don’t have anything better to do
than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. Tell her I’m in
court.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Court’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tell her I broke my leg and had to be
shot.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you tell her yourself?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: –And then send out a notice of judgement
on my win today!</p>
<p>****: I’ll get right on it.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Miranda! I didn’t see you. Hey, you look
lovely, today. Here, I bought you a gift.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Thanks. I heard about your victory today.
You’re making quite an impression on the partnership committee.</p>
<p>****: Oh, that’s right. You folks are meeting again soon. “Allan,
Stewart, Konigsberg, and Ried.” There’s something about the rhythm of
fours. It’s like a full measure. Well, anyway, I’ve got a client waiting
in my office–</p>
<p><strong>miranda .</strong>: Actually, something important h as come
up. You’re not busy tonight, are you?</p>

<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Uh…would I . . . ? What did you say?</p>
<p>****: I proposed, I . . . Look, I know this Boston thing is a great
opportunity, good job, mo ney .. . everything. But I started to think
about being three thousand miles away from you and Max. And I didn’t
like it. I– Look, I know it’s a lot to ask, to move and everything, but
I . . . . I love</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Max Factor… Happy birthday. How old are
you today? T h ir t y ? Forty?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, you’ve held up well. I only wish
there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to
mark this day, like….</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: . . . A present! .</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It’s… it’s. a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Baseball stuff!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Baseball stuff.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Will you play catch with me?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tonight. After your party, you have my
word on it.</p>
<p><strong>audr ey</strong>: Jerry, these are for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The company wants me to get started right
away.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can’t just pick up and move to Boston with
two days notice.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ju st come check it out. You a nd Max, see
the town. Let’s Then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life,
fine.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s just not that simple… What about my
job? I’ve been at UCLA three years.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s New England. They’re lousy with
colleges. You can’t swing a bat back there without hitting a
college.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: There are other factors involved.</p>
<p>****: T here they are now. �.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Did you have fun? How were the wrestling
matches?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Big fun. Manly fun. Am I right, Maxie?</p>
<p>****: It was fun..</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: So how were the wrestling matches ? Did
you have fun?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Max , my man! My happy birthday man!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: One-two-three-four-five… and one for good
luck.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Did you see that? He struck the child!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look what dad got me!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whoa! Great! I have my glove in the car.
We’ll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch. Then tonight
we’ll oil</p>
<p><strong>fletcher �.</strong>: When is it his birthday?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Some thing’s come up. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mom, let’s go. I want to play.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We’ll talk tonight.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max’s birthday?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher’</strong>: Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I knew that. I
did. I blocked it out weeks ago. The se ven tee nt h of May. Max’s
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s the eighteenth.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: The seventeenth of May is the day I
.remind myself that the eighteenth is Max’s birthday. See you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: This is good. This is really smart.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Only i t ’ s . . . Like not true. Every
word of it is a lie.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I mean… isn’t that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that
after you’ve provided years of faithful service and loving support, of
raising his children – They are his?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: After all that, your husband wants to deny
you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Seven single acts of indiscretion.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: –Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of
which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is
responsible, for.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last
night studying your c ase. Not just your case… b ut you. And, by now, I
feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant
businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another
man–</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p>****: –Seven .other men. You’re not trying to deny him what is r ig
htf ull y his. All you’re insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours.
And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. I think you’re bending over
backwards.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Well, I did agree to give him j oint
custody of the kids… He’s always been a good father.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: And you’ve always been a good wife.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. . .</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: There’s such a thing as being t oo nice.
That’s why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that
there is more than one side to this st ory. All I’m asking is the
opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. Will you give me
that opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes! I ’ m tired of getting kicked
around.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Good for you!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ’ m so grateful I
have an attorney I can trust.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re good. You’re really good.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, pshaw.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a
truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it’s going to
g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you’ll make
partner.</p>
<p>****: Actually, how would you like to make a partner right now?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p>****: Captain Fuzzy is my name, Making children happy is my game,
With a shake and a juggle, And a big belt buckle, You’ll all be glad I
came. ’</p>
<p>****: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, if you don’t hire your brother, who
will?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They called me again from B oston. They
really want me there tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: . . . I can’t go to Boston.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’ll love it there.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can’t move Max three thousand miles away
from his father.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Audrey, I have never said a bad word about
your ex –</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: But how much responsibility does Fletcher
take for Max, now? He’d never come over if you didn’t remind him.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I know. But if they’re three thousand miles
apart they’ll never see each other. Fletcher will never come to Boston
and how can I send Max cross-country to him?</p>
<p><strong>.jerry</strong>: So because your ex-husband is unreliable, we
can’t-’-</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I know, it’s not logical, it’s emotional.
I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I still want to marry you.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton… I hope I’m not
calling too late… Mr. Crisitelli, I’m afraid I have to turn down your
offer..’. So am I . . . Well, I’ve fallen in love with this beautiful
woman in L.A. and she doesn’t want to leave and I won’t leave without
her… Well, thank you very much… Yes, good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>a udrey</strong>: Fletcher, where are you? We’re getting
ready to cut the cake.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Urn, actually, something has come up. A
problem on a new caaa– .</p>
<p><strong>f let che r</strong>: A-h-h-h-!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Nothing. I just nailed my �knee into the
desk… Listen, I’m really sorry I can’t ’make it.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max is going to be so disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ll make it up to him, I promise. I’ll
pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Do you want me to put him on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ah, no. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: All right, birthday boy, make a wish.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: C’mon, honey. It can be anything– whatever
you want most in the world.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max, your dad is sorry. He had to work.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He said he was coming. He promised.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yes, well, he… promises he’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn’t tell a
lie.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A clock on a wall. It’s 9:15’. We are–</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: S o . . . was it good for you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ve had better.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: “I’ve had better?”</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: “I’ve had better?!”</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: “I’ve had better?”</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: New in the building?</p>
<p><strong>model</strong>: I just moved in Monday.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you
the grand tour.</p>
<p>****: O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No. Just the ones I want to bang like a
drum.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Any change, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>.fletcher</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Could you spare some?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Unquestionably.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Will you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Because I resent your p re sen ce. You
fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I
don’t believe you’ll use the money for food, but I believe you’ll use it
for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Jerkoff.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: You look like you’re having a rough
morning.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ve had better.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Good morning, Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Dana. ”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: All right, Virginia, how much will it take
to put an end to this?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Fifty per cent of your estate.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of
adultery? What’s your case?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Our case is simply this. . .</p>
<p><strong>dana .</strong>: Interesting, though based on your track
record, I expected a little more.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher ..</strong>: Wa it! Wait! I’ve got it in
writing!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise for the Honorable Judge William
Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play
hardball, I’m game.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole
versus Virginia Cole. How’re we doing this morning, counsel?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: And you, Mr. Reid?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, I’m a little upset about a bad
sexual episode I had last night–</p>
<p>****: Well, you’re still young. It’ll happen more and more. In the
meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? First, Mr. Reid, I
see that your client was previously represented by Mr. Rand of your
office.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: I take it you’re seeking to
substitute in as counsel?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Fine , fine. And for the record, the
reason is?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to
my client’s case.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: I take it you don’t share the same
ethical objections, Mr. Reid?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I have lower standards, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the
substitution of counsel, I’ll allow it. Is that what you want,
Mrs. Cole?</p>
<p>****: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>****: What are you doing?</p>
<p>****: Your Honor, I ’ d like a continuance!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens “</strong>: This case has already been delayed
several times, Mr. Reid.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I realize that, Your Honor, but I ’ d
really, really, really like a continuance.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: I’ll have to hear good cause,
counselor. What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I can’t lie!</p>
<p>****: Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I’m still waiting for the good caus
e. Now, do you have it or</p>
<p>****: Not.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Motion for a continuance denied. Is
there any chance of a settlement in this case?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I don’t think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it
abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to –</p>
<p><strong>settle! settle! settle!</strong>: Dana and Mr. Cole look at
Fletcher with surprise.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: There appears to have been a change
in strategy. Let’s go to my chambers and negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual
agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We
have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private
investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not
her husband.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It certainly does.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: However, my client has no desire to see his
ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he’s willing to offer her a cash
settlement of.two point four million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Two four seems like a pretty fair
offer, Mr. Reid.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In
fact, I’d say beyond fair, bordering on stupid.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d?
That Ms. Appleton’s willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack
of faith in her position?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No, not at all. She’s got my client dead
to rights. When</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it –
I’ve seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you.
Even Clarence Darrow couldn’t explain this away.</p>
<p><strong>judge samioan</strong>: Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite
explanation, I’d say you’re dead in the water. How’s you client’s
story?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: The best that money can buy, Y o u r
Honor. �</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Strong corroborating evidence?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: We have evidence that you are not going
to-believe.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: You’re pretty confident how this
trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: All right! Double the offer! Four point eight!
And not a penny more.</p>
<p>****: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If
your client has half a brain, she’ll jump at the offer.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle.
I’m talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,</p>
<p><strong>find-no-line-at-the-friggin’-</strong>: DMV miracle! You’ve
gone from two point four to four point eight million in…</p>
<p>****: four minutes. Think of it this way – now you’re getting paid
seven hundred thou per schtupp!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday – I’m
the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another
man–</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Seven! �</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: – Seven other men. With the story you came
up with, I don’t think I can lose. I want to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mrs. Cole, you don’t �. understand, I–</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
settlement?</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Th ere’ s no settlement. Trial to
start at one-thirty sharp.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher .</strong>: I think you need help.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What’s shakin’, Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Your cellulite, Tubster.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hiy a, Fletcher. How’s the Cole case
going?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: ’Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with
my career right behind it.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: Fletcher is RUNNING NOW, COVERING HIS EARS and
SINGING LOUDLY so as not to hear OTHER EMPLOYEE ’GREETINGS…</p>
<p><strong>� greta</strong>: Hi, boss. What’s happening</p>
<p><strong>please don’t ask!</strong>: – And races into his office.</p>
<p>****: Do n’t panic. You can beat this – it’s all a matter of
willpower.</p>
<p><strong>fl et ch er</strong>: A test. . . Something small… Aha!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Red. Red. All right. Focus,</p>
<p>****: The color of this pen is � r–. R–. R–! The color of this pen
is–blue! AAAAHH!</p>
<p>****: Ahhhh! One’ tiny lie and I can’t say it!!</p>
<p>****: ’ I’ll write.it!</p>
<p><strong>inadvertently:</strong>: “This pen is blue.”</p>
<p><strong>no, no, no, no, no! ! ! !</strong>: Greta enters to find–
FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Boss, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: . The pen is blue!! The pen is .</p>
<p><strong>blue !!!</strong>: Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair.
A moment – then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Red?</p>
<p>****: Oh, that’s easy for you to say?!</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Home? Was the case settled?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No. I have to be in court at
one-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Well, then how can you.go home?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t know!!!</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: Before I forget – Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know
where the Darvis settlement offer stands.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I only proposed a settlement t o dick with
them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it. .</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: ’�…dick with them.” Okay. Your accountant,
Philip, called to remind you about getting together. .</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’d rather shave my ass and sit in
vinegar..</p>
<p>****: Got it. And your mother called again. Are you still on
vacation?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: So then you’re here?</p>
<p>****: shaking his head</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: I ’ m having a little trouble following you.
what do I say to your mom?</p>
<p>****: Tell her I’m a thoughtless son who’d rather spend ten hours
clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her– but
only if she asks. You.might also add that she deserves better, though I
hope to God you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Thanks for clearing that up. And that’s it,
except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your
son.</p>
<p><strong>ohh! i’m such a shit!!</strong>: He reacts, particularly
stunned by this truth.</p>
<p><strong>audrey’</strong>: Hey, Fletcher. T was wondering if you were
going to still pick up Max after school today.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t think I can. I had a case I was
certain would settle and it didn’t. I have to go to trial this
afternoon, God help me.</p>
<p>****: Right.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It’s true… I really do want to see Max,
today.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: How about that. I really do.</p>
<p>****: But things keep coming up at the last minute.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes, but-this time it’s different.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I see. And how is that?</p>
<p>****: This time I’m telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: But last night you weren’t?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Having sex.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: ,</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No. It was with someone I don’t even like.
But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that</p>
<p><strong>a u d r ey</strong>: M y God!!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is dad picking me up?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No, I’m sorry, Max. He can’t make it. I
will. I’ll work it out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I guess my wish didn’t come � true.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What wish?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn’t
tell a lie.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Answer, answer, answer…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Audrey, let me explain. Something has
happened to me–</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Fletcher, something else is about to happen
to you.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher.</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max and I are moving to Boston.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max
and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I’m going to
go. God knows I don’t have any reason to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well then you’ll have pretty much the same
relationship you have with him now.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Audrey, please…. Is this because of what I
just said on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: That was the straw and this is the camel’s
back saying goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Heading home.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: When you gee there, stay there. I’ll be
right over. We have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ll be right- there!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I
must confess– after last night’s incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I
was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your
chances of making partner.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: But then I thought, “No, that ’s not fair.
Fletcher didn’t mean to insult me.”</p>
<p>****: “It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and
Fletcher is very, very sorry.”</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Isn’t that right, Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Uh – not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: N o ? No?! What are you sayi ng? Have you
no respect for me?!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: None, whatsoever. I mean, I ’ d like to
respect you, and if it weren’t for your mistreatment of the associates,
your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I
would.</p>
<p><strong>m iranda</strong>: But – what about last night?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I was afraid you wouldn’t support my
partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for
sexual conquests.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: The color of the pen is – re d ! .</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What’s your problem, schmuck?!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I ’ m an inconsiderate prick!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: C’mon, you can do this! The color of the
pen is – RED!</p>
<p><strong>fletc her</strong>: S hi t !!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Do you know why I stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Depends on how long you were following
me.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Why don’t we take it from the
top.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: � Here goes – I didn’t fasten my seatbelt,
I didn’t glance in my rearview mirror, I didn’t signal when I pulled
away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I
almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I
failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I
changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the</p>
<p><strong>intersection-without</strong>: signalling while running a red
light and speeding.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: May I see your driver’s license?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It’s in my other pants.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I see. And where are your � other
pants?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hanging from my boss’s credenza.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Do you expect me to believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Do you think I’m an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes – but that’s beside the point! My
license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging
from a credenzaJ I wouldn’t lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but
I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I see. So you ..have no reason to
try and hide your license from me?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I didn’t say that. I have other reasons.
Seventeen reasons, to be precise. Unpaid parking tickets.</p>
<p>****: Be gentle.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Audrey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Wait? You know, I just had an insight into
myself. I ’ m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because
you’ll be right over and – here’s the crazy part – I actually wait.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I can explain–</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did
you come in a cab?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Thank you. . I can’t tell you how much
this means to me.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can. One thousand, six hundred, and
fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You scratched my car!</p>
<p><strong>tow-yard employee</strong>: Where? .</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Right there!</p>
<p><strong>tow-yard employee</strong>: Oh that? That was already
there.</p>
<p>****: Why, you – you liar! Do you know what I ’ m going to do about
this?</p>
<p><strong>tow-yard employee</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: …Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will
just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won’t show up,
and if I finally got the judgment you’d just stiff me anyway, so what
I’m gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and the tail
pipe!</p>
<p><strong>tow-yard employee</strong>: You’ve been here before, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well I can’t remember when I’ve had more
fun, now if you’ll excuse me, I have a class.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about
this Boston situation.</p>
<p><strong>. audrey</strong>: What do you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You can’t go. It’s not fair. Taking Max
three thousand miles away is not fair.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Let’ s define “fair.” Last crushed because
his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Last night–</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: – Was none of my business. When it happened
two years ago it was my business, but now I don’t have to care anymore.
See, that’s the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max.
Everything you do matters to him… and everything you don’t do.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: All right– now let me tell you
something…you’re absolutely right. I’m guilty of all charges. I’m
throwing myself on the mercy of your -court.</p>
<p>****: I have an idea. I’ll come over tonight, right after court lets
out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We’ll have a
game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We’re suppose to be on a plane</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this
first. Please. Au drey, I’ve lost you. Don’t make me lose Max, too.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re really coming?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: This is iron-clad. This is the mother of
all promises. What time?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …Six?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ten-to-six.</p>
<p>****: All right… only if I tell Max you’re coming and you don’t show
up and I have to see that look on Max’s face – that heartbreaking look–
it’s Boston, Fletcher.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher.</strong>: I will be there.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I hope so. Do you know what your son was
doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his
birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn’t
tell a lie.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh my God! That-‘s it! An innocent kid - -
a heartfelt plea– a birthday wish! Sure, it’ s impossible –but it ’makes
sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>ms . berry</strong>: Are you Max’s dad? I ’ m Ms. Berry,
Max’s teacher!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hi. Listen, I need to talk to</p>
<p><strong>ms. berry</strong>: Mr. Reid, we were just talking ab ou t
careers. You’re a lawyer, aren’t you?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mr. Reid it’would be wonderful for the children
to hear something positive about lawyers!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, actually– �</p>
<p><strong>ms. berry</strong>: Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us
what it’s like to be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Uh, hi. Uh, I’m a lawyer and I work at a
big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. berry</strong>: One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe some of the
children have</p>
<p><strong>questions</strong>: Jeffrey?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What kind of lawyer are you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mostly, I ’ m a divorce lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It means if you’re daddy left your mommy,
he’d call me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I help people fight over their money and
their children.</p>
<p><strong>theodore</strong>: Can’t they fight without you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher ’ “</strong>: They could but then J wouldn’t make a
living.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Why would my daddy leave my mommy?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: To marry a younger woman. To escape a
loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an
illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare
tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged
arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death.</p>
<p>****: Well, I think it’s time for fingerpainting.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Monster-Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dadzilla. You came to play catch?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No. I ’ d like to, but I can’t right
now.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I ’ m sorry I missed your party la st
night. How was your Uncle Glen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange
hair…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: That’s why he should have worn
make-up.</p>
<p><strong>’ max .</strong>: I want to play kickball with my
friends.-</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yeah, okay, urn… Your mother told me
about… the wish you made last night. It came true.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really? You mean you have to tell the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No matter what?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No matter what.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is wrestling real?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: In the Olympics, yes. On . Channel 23,
no.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Will sitting close to the TV set make me go
blind?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Not in a million years.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If I keep making this face–</p>
<p>****: will it get stuck that way?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: .If I go in the water right after lunch, will I
drown?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Only if you can’t ’swim.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why do I have to eat squash?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Because your mom buys it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How come you’re always too busy to play with
me?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I . . . I don’t know. I ’ m . . . Hey, you
know I’m coming over to nig ht. We’re gonna play together.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Baseball?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: . Yes! This is absolutely an</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you.
I ’ m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So you can lie?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Not to you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Max, sometimes grownups… need to lie. It’s
hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here’s an example. When Mommy was
pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I
thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she’d say to me “How do I
lo ok?” So I’d say, “Oh, honey, you’re beautiful, you’re glowing.11
Otherwise, I would’ve hurt Mommy’s fee ling s. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t think she was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Right. No… Max, I don’t know how to get
along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could
lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job… Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Will you help me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: That’s my boy!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Now, do whatever you did last night… only
this time, make an un-wish.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I did it. ^</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Great! Great! Now to test –</p>
<p><strong>slaps him.</strong>: Fletcher returns to his son.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p>****: Not like I ’ d hoped. Did you really unwish it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Only what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant
it. This time when I unwished it I only did it ’cause you told me
to.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, then do it again. Only this time,
mean it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because I don’t want you to lie.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I explained this to you! I have to lie.
Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But you’re the only one who makes me feel
bad.</p>
<p>****: Max, recess ’is over, come on in.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I am coming over, tonight, Max. You
believe me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ll see you tonight, buddy… That’s a
promise.</p>
<p><strong>macho attorney</strong>: Yo, Fletcher! How’s it hanging?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Short and shrivelled.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Fletcher! I’m still waiting for your call. I
guess you must’ve lost my card –</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Or my phone was busy –</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Or you just forgot –</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No –</p>
<p>****: Or something. So anyway,’ why don’t you swing by my place
around seven-thirty!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Philip… I don’t want to come over to your
house!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Fi n e ! We’ll go out! There’s this new
karaoke bar I’ve been dying to try. I’ll pick you up at your office!
Seven- thirty! !</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Do you want your messages?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: My son hates me.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: No! He loves you. I’ve seen y ou together.
You’re his hero.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: O h yeah? Last night at his birthday
party, he made a �wish. That I wouldn’t be able to tell a lie for one
whole day.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Kids…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It came true.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It’s true. Didn’t it seem odd to you that
I kept telling the truth all morning?</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Well, yeah, but…</p>
<p>****: You’re telling me that you can’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: That’s right! I am incapable of lying.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Just today?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It’s a
twenty-four hour curse.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Yes, those are going around.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Go ahead. Ask me something I ’ d normally
lie about.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I
wanted a raise–</p>
<p>****: Forget it. Let’s not do this.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: – and the firm wouldn’t.give me one. And I
asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said
the company wouldn’t permit it because it creates jealousy among the
other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the
dough?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Greta, please… Yes Judge Stevens, hi!..
Fletcher Reid. I ’ m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour…
Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home
and stay there the rest of the day…111? Am I ill?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: In a way.</p>
<p>****: Please, lie to him for me.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: I remember when you. bought me t hi s silver
frame. From Tiffany’s.</p>
<p>****: . . . Tiffany’s?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Jumbo’s House of Junk.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ll give you the raise!</p>
<p>****: Here’s your raise.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hi, Judge Stevens?… Yes, I know I haven’t
given you a reason.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: But if you could just do this for me,
I–</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hold on, please,</p>
<p>****: Hello… Mom!!</p>
<p>****: Mom… Well, I wasn’t actually on vacation… Because I didn’t want
to talk to you… Because you insist on talking to me about Dad’s bowel
movements – size, color, frequency… I’ll call you later… No, not
really.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the
Judge! Greta…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’m on my knees in a nine hundred dollar
suit. Don’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: A few years ago a friend of mine had a
burglar up on her roof.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>greta ..</strong>: A burglar. -He fell through the kitchen
skylight and landed on a cutting board on a butcher’s knife, cutting his
l e g. He sued my friend. The</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No. . . but what’ s your poijit!</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: My point is, it’s hard to get justice. But
this is justice,</p>
<p>****: Have a nice day in court, bubbie.</p>
<p><strong>greta–</strong>: He runs directly into Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you.
Are you busy?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Extremely.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Good. Would you follow me, please?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Fletcher, did you know that the partnership
committee is being headed up by Mr. Allan himself?</p>
<p>****: Say, you used to work directly for Mr. Allan, didn’t you?</p>
<p>****: Tell me, what do you think of him?</p>
<p>****: He’s a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a
belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.</p>
<p>****: How delightful!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting.
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: �It’s good to see you again, Fletcher.
’.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Oh, that’s right. You used to work
together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I said… What do you think of Mr. Allan?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher .</strong>: He’s a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile
of cow dung.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: Marvelous! Marvelous! That’s what I love
most about this firm– the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good-
fellowship!</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: And thanks for those flowers for my
anniversary. My wife loved them.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, I’m due in court… bye- bye.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Counselors, are we ready to
begin?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: little too</p>
<p>****: N o sir! We are not ready to b eg in. My client has not
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher � .</strong>: – until now.</p>
<p>****: Did you and Mrs. Cole ever make lo– forni– roll in the h– make
the beast with two ba – Did you two ever fu– fu– Fu!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Wate r! Get him water!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Fu– fu–</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: S it down! Get some air!</p>
<p>****: Try to relax! Breathe deeply!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: W hat?! What?!</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: I couldn’t find any water, so I got him
coffee!</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Judge is taking the bench.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Sorry. One of the kids threw up in the
car.</p>
<p>****: You brought your kids. . . to your divorce?</p>
<p>****: Sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, it’s working. I feel sorry for them
already.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Ms. Appleton, you may begin.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private
investigator. Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS
from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.</p>
<p>****: – From March six through June twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole at
the behest of Mr. Cole. During that period, I noted that Mr. Cole left
each day between seven-forty and seven- fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four
hours. I was able to take several photographs of the male visitor.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I see. And do you .know what Mrs. Cole and her
male visitor</p>
<p><strong>bryson</strong>: Well, they were pretty good about keeping
the shades drawn – but I sure was able to hear. I made an audiotape of
one such., “session.”</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: With the Court’s permission, I would like to
play the tape.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Your Honor, I object!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: And why is that, Mr. Reid?</p>
<p>****: Because it’s devastating to my �case.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Overruled..</p>
<p><strong>downs the glass.</strong>: Periodically CUTTING to Virginia,
Mr. Cole, Dan and the thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor
engaged in intense physical activity.</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: So , what did you say? You ready?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Oh boy am I ready.</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: Good. Let me help you off with that.
Come on, lie down.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Wai t a minute. Do you have
protection?</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: Right here. Okay, now I ’ m gonna show
you something new.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Oh, I’ve never done it like this before.
.�.</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: Don’t worry, you can take it. Oh yeah.
That’s it. There you go. Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: Yes, yes, yes –</p>
<p><strong>male visitor</strong>: Oh yeah, bring it on .home – yes! Yes!
Yes!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes! YES! YES!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: No questions? .</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No questions?</p>
<p>****: No questions.</p>
<p>****: Petitioner rests.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: All right, Mr. Reid. You may
proceed.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: How?!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Would the Court be willing to grant me a
short bathroom break?</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: It can’t wait?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Not unless you want to mop up.</p>
<p>****: All right, but get back in here immediately so .we can finish
this.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What did I think? That I could piss for
forty-five minutes?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s going on in-there?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I ’ m abusing myself! Do you mind?!</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: I found him like this in the bathroom.
Somebody beat the hell out of him.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Who did this?</p>
<p>****: A madman, Your Honor.. A desperate fool at the end of his
pitiful.rope.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: -What did he look like?</p>
<p>****: About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in
his eye.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Bailiff, have the deputies search the
building.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Under the circumstances, I have no
choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: – Unless, of course, you think you
can still proceed?</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes, I can.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Splendid. I admire your courage,
Mr. Reid. I’ll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then
we’ll get started.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p>****: Maxi-pad. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Great. You know Paul and Emanuel from across
the street?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: The twins.</p>
<p>****: Well, they never want to play baseball with me, but I told them
I was gonna play tonight with my Dad, so now they want to play with us.
Is it okay?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh boy. We’re setting up a whole field in the
yard. Where we buried Petey the hamster is second base. You’re still
coming right?’</p>
<p>****: I’11 be there. I gotta go now, Max. I’ll see you in two
hours.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s really coming.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the
man from the tape.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ve slipped into the seventh circle of
Hell, thank you, and you?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Shouldn’t we go over our testimony?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, basically the plan is I walk you
through the tape step by step, I ask you questions–</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: And we give the explanation you came up
with.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple
enough.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Do esn’t it? And I’ll finish up with a
dramatic series of questions, something like… “Mr. Falk, isn’t it true
that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo–”</p>
<p><strong>flethcer</strong>: Sorry. I’m fine. “Mr. Falk, isn’t it true
that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo–</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh my God! I can’t do it! I can’t finish
the question if I know the answer is a lie!</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: Don’t let me interrupt, Fletcher. I just
want you to know I’ll be observing this a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
see you in action.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: I’m looking forward to it. Go get
’em!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: C’mon! Gotta rephrase the question!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Respondent calls… Lawrence Falk.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia
Cole?</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Isn’t it true that your relationship with
my client is entirely platonic, not?</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: If I might rephrase your Honor. Is your
relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?</p>
<p>**x**: Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? Is
not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?</p>
<p>****: Mr. Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely
platonic?</p>
<p>****: No. I mean, yes. I think.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yes, is your relationship with my client
not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client
entirely platonic?</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: How ‘bout just answering the question you
think I’m asking?’</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Your Honor, he’s badgering the wintness!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: It’s hig witness!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Did you ever not make lo– Did you not ever
make lo–</p>
<p><strong>you?!!</strong>: Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on,
unable to stop</p>
<p><strong>humped her. brains out! !</strong>: A GASP from the audience.
All eyes are on Fletcher.</p>
<p>****: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Uh…no questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Call your next witness.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I have no further witnesses, your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: You have no further witnesses?!</p>
<p>****: What are you doing? Call me.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Mr. Reid?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Call me, damn it!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You don’t understand. I can’t lie . Until
nine-sixteen tonight, I can’t even.ask a question that calls for a
lie!</p>
<p><strong>virg inia</strong>: L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money.
I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum
bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Thirty-one?</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Mr. Reid, we’re not getting any
younger…</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Mr. Reid you have presented virtually
nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule
in favor of –</p>
<p>****: Your Honor, I call Virginia Cole to the stand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: What the hell is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Kissing his career goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>balifp</strong>: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Mrs. Cole – may I call you Virginia?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: But that would be a lie, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Isn’t your true name…</p>
<p>****: Carlotta?!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Well, yes. But it wasn’t me so I started
using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher �.</strong>: Not really. It’s just the first and
smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let’s
take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we,
Carlotta?</p>
<p><strong>f letcher</strong>: Your driver’s license. What color are
your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Blue.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove
your contact l enses? What color would they be then?</p>
<p>****: Brown.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: And here it says you’re a b l on de . Are
you? C’mon, Carlotta, there’s a very easy way for us to check. If you
don’t remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Brunette.</p>
<p><strong>fletch er</strong>: More like a dirty brown, isn’t it? Let’s
see - . - ” Weight: one-o- five”? Please…</p>
<p><strong>virginia .</strong>: One-eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: So on this single document, you basically
lied at every opportunity. I’m sure a woman as vain as you would also
lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What’s the truth?
1962? ’60? How young did you try to make yourself?</p>
<p>****: Wrong! I didn’t lie to make myself younger. I made myself
older. I was born in 1965!”</p>
<p>****: What? You’re trying to tell us you lied to make yourself
older?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes! ” lied so I could get married! So
.there Mister ’I</p>
<p><strong>got-all-the-answers-because-i-</strong>:
went-to-law-school’!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: Mr. Reid, does this have a point?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! My client
lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which
makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR</p>
<p>****: Prenuptual agreements.</p>
<p><strong>prenuptual agreements! thank</strong>: YOU VERY LITTLE! This
contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed � more often
than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies
and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven
point three-nine- five million dollars!! Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T
T ! !</p>
<p>****: Nothing further, your Honor!</p>
<p>****: Q uie t! Let me see-the license and birth certificate.</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: In light of this new evidence, the
court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded
half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and
ninety-five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: That son of bitch pulled it off!</p>
<p><strong>judge stevens</strong>: O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand
both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No! I’m contesting custody.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Payback. For him trying to prevent me from
collecting my thirty-seven million.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: He was entitled to prevent you. You
committed adultery.’ You only won because you’re a liar, remember? .</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No. You pointed out that my husband took
advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I’m
going to hit him where it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: But – but – you said he was a good

million dollars because she’s a liar! And now as an extra added little
bonus, we’re going to let her steal, the kids, too?</p>

costs…and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i

<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Honey, don^t say that.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max, there’s something I-want to talk to you
about. . .</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: When would we move?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Soon. My semester’s almost over. You only
have a week left of school… You like Jerry don’t you? So what do you
say, should we check it out? Jerry wants us to come with him tonight. He
has to pick out a place to live and he really wants our help?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Could I get a sled for when it snows?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Of course you can.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: Answer! Answer!! Answer!! !</p>

<p>****: I can’t talk now, Fletcher. We have to pack.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Wait, the most amazing thing’s happened to
me! I am feeling so good…</p>
<p>****: Pack?! Did you say pack?!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Max was sitting on the porch again, waiting
for his dad. I won’t let you do this to him anymore. I won’t let you do
this to me.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to
you. I .swear, I’m a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a
thousand dollars and bail me out… Hello? O ne more call!! I need another
call!!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: And what about our water su pply ? You
don’t think “the man’s” dumped enough toxins to render every dick in
this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You’re damn rightJ “The man”
does anything he w an ts. We’re nothing but pu ppets… Little game pieces
they move back and forth.</p>

loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here..,</p>
<p><strong>greta</strong>: Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of
being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being
stuck in the truth.</p>
<p>****: Oh, my God!! I have to go! Thanks again, Greta!</p>
<p>****: By the way, the truth is that I need you and I couldn’t file a
paperclip without you!</p>

<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I’m impounding this vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: W h y ? What for? For changing lanes?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I just ran your tags through the
computer. You’ve got. seventeen unpaid parking tickets.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No ! I paid them! This morning! That’s the
truth! I swear!!</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Not according to the computer.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: The computer is wrong! It computer’s a

<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You can straighten it out at the
impound yard.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: That’s right, no! I’m not gonna lose my
son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer. Now

<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: ’Scuse me, sir. Do you have any - -</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Change? Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Could you spare some?</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Unquestionably.</p>
<p><strong>’ fletcher</strong>: Alright, I get your point. But this is a
crisis! Look, I’ll give you ten bucks.</p>
<p>****: It’s so shiny and new.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tw ent y. .</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Minted in Denver. Imagine that.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Thirty-four. That’s all I have.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: It’s worth twice that to screw you.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer!</strong>: Fletcher turns, spots a familiar building

<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I just need to use the phone to call a
cab. I work here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. allan</strong>: Used to work here.</p>
<p>****: Son, that man is tresspassing.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hold it! I’ve got ten years worth of dirt
on you and this firm, and I’m in the kind of mood today to get a lot off
my chest. You let me use the phone or I start talking!!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fletcher’s is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the

<p><strong>philip</strong>: Seven-thirty… It’s Karaoke time!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You’re saving my life, Philip.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You know, it’s funny, but for some reason I
was beginning to think you didn’t like me. Isn’t that silly?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher .</strong>: No. It’s not silly. I don’t like
you.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t like you. I’m sorry. I find you
boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn’t know a good time if it sat
on your face. I’m sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really
felt. Are you upset?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No. To be honest, I don’t like you either.
You treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades. .</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Then why are you always trying to
socialize with me?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You’re a client. I figured if I didn’t try
to be your friend, you’d get a new accountant.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Philip, I don’t like you as a person, but
I’m crazy about you as my accountant. I ’ d never hire a new accountant.
Never!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: So we don’t have to like each other
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher -</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>. philip</strong>: All right. Sooner I get you �to the
airport, sooner I can dump your sorry ass off.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain,
something, anything…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on

the right, passing on the left. They can’t make this- deal any easier
than it is… Come on… coming through…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Help the poor?…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t trust you. I don’t know what the
hell that uniform is. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Please step through again.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Ahhh!! ! Damn..;</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What? I’tii practically naked!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: It’s called a ZIPPER, Hodgy…</p>
<p><strong>fl e tc h er</strong>: N ooo!!!</p>

<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Look out!! ! –</p>
<p><strong>-nothing’s coming!!</strong>: The woman raises her eyebrows
and looks anyway. And Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Hey!! Hey!!!!</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: In case of a water landing, please use

<p>****: It’s right here, honey.</p>
<p><strong>m ax</strong>: Mom! Mom!! ’</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Just a second, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mom, it’s dad!</p>
<p><strong>au drey</strong>: W hat? What about dad?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Fletcher?!</p>
<p><strong>at that instant – the plane makes a sharp turn!</strong>: BUT
THE STAIRS DON’T! They keeps going straight, heading � right for the END
OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE</p>
<p><strong>cart. . -</strong>: And BAM! FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE
LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!</p>
<p>****: Oh boy, the truth hurts. Yes indeed.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you.</p>
<p>****: Greta? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Jerry, trying to</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>fletc her</strong>: That’s two questions. A; Yes, but I think
the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally
have that talk with you about Boston.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Okay, okay… The whole truth and nothing
but the truth,</p>
<p>****: I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my
life… you and Max.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I know you’ve met somebody… somebody
pretty great… and the truth is I wish you didn’t but you did and… All I
’ m asking i s . . . Please don’t move to Boston. Please don’t take Max
away.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You can come visit anytime. It’s only a four
hour flight.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t want to visit him. That’s what
I’ve been doing– visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in
his life. I don’t want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want
to be his father.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I know I have no right to ask, but can I
talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in
L.A. I’ve got all kinds of connect ions… what do you do again?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I design security systems.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: How symbolic. Okay great. You know
Pac-Tec?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The biggest.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: One of their systems shorted out and
burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for
justice. If I ask them they’ll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds
. ..</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Don’t put Jerry in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s okay. Boston means this</p>
<p>****: to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy.
Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I’ll go along with.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: All I want is for Max to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You better know your jury. You’re hot
exactly Max’s hero today.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Just let me present my case.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher/terminator</strong>: I have been sent from the
future to destroy you. . . Argghhh!</p>
<p>****: You mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You wanted me to stop lying. But lying
isn’t the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that’s the problem. Sometimes we lie
to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth
gets in our way… But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for
more</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s telling the truth, Mom. He’s not allowed
to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Max. .. it’s 9:22.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I’ve been
able to lie for the last seven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So then, you were…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: No! It wasn’t a lie. I just wanted to be
honest with you and tell you – there was no wish to guarantee it
anymore. You just have to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mommy… do we have to go to Boston?</p>
<p><strong>audr ey</strong>: No. We don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can we play catch tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>m ax</strong>: Dad! !</p>
<p><strong>fletch er</strong>: Ma x i mu m ! !</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Transformer!!! .</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Malfunction in vector seven. I have lost
control of my affection reflex…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Procreate! Procreate!</p>
<p>****: Fletcher… You’re gonna lose a limb–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, dad, let’s play catch!!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Sr. . .</p>
<p>****: Here you go, mom. Oh, you mean with a ball…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I
ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about
you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: So, you up for a little friendly
competition?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, you go play with your son.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I wasn’t talking about basesball.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Alright, it’s time to show you the old
Fletcher Reid change up.</p>
