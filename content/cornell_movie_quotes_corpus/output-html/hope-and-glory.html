<p><strong>chamberlain</strong>: …those assurances… by eleven o’clock… a
state of war… that this country… at war with Germany.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Flat foot floogie with a Floy Floy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Stop that, Sue!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She just sings it. She doesn’t know what it
means.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Where are my stockings? I can’t find my
stockings!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Dawn, darling. They’ve started a war
again.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We mustn’t frighten the little ones.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I don’t care! I want my stockings!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Stockings? War! Don’t you understand!
War!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: War! War!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Clive. Don’t. Dawn, please.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: German planes! German planes!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I did see them. I did.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He’s the worst liar.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: These are the fruits of my loins?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Is it peace in out time?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No, Mother! It’s War! War!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: :War! War! War!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: That’s the all-clear. Testing. They were just
testing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Such a beautiful day too.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Flat Foot Floogie with a Floy Floy.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Going to put a rockery garden over it,
Mac.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dad. It’s full of water again.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Crocodiles! Aah!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: The sodding water table.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive?
Caulk it like the hull of a ship.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Thanks. I hope you can come for the
launching.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s not fair on them. It’s selfish to keep
them with you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My aunt in Australia has offered..</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Snap it up. Great chance for them. Lot more
future out there.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s so far way. I couldn’t bear it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Kids don’t care. You’re thinking of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I didn’t mean it like that, Grace. Why does
it always come out wrong?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I know you mean well.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: There you go again. You’re so bloody nice. I
want to shake you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Nothing will ever be the same again, Molly.
And the funny thing is, I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Now you’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There’s a soldier at he door, looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You’re the biggest fibber.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s dinner time. It really is. Cross my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: If there’s no solider, I’ll have you
instead.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Cry baby Bunting.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Few bombs might wake up this country.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on
a Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: This phoney war get’s on my nerves. If we’re
going to have a war, I wish they’d get it started.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Just ignore her, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: There are many ways of saluting.. ..An old
soldier insulting a young subaltern.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: As an officer, you counter that with one of
these.</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: Here is the news and this is Alvar
Lidell reading it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …It was a toss-up. His company went to India,
mine went to France. Flip of a coin.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: …two Indians to fan me all night. The
heat.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: ….buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while
he’s out there playing polo and sticking pigs.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It was the best time of his life.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How many of our class left? You and me out of
twenty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And Jim.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s left of him. He’ll never see outside of
the Star and Garter.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I rode into battle…</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: …On horseback, with a drawn sword, leading a
battalion of Gurkhas against the Turks.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: And where were the Turks?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No Turks.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: We didn’t know that. It was a suicide
mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: They’d gone.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Saw Clive coming.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: We all had to write a last letter home.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And it was the last. Hasn’t written a letter
since. Not even a birthday card.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s not like when you’re in it. Just young
boys spilling their guts in the mud.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What were they like, the Germans, when you
were a prisoner of war?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Most of them were very decent to me.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t go saying that. You’ll
get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You can speak German, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A bit.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Say something. I want to know what it sounds
like.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Certainly not!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: In den ganzen Welt die meisten Leute sind
dumm.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Not so loud!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dad, the News. It’s the News.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Go off and play, son.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But Dad, It’s the News.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Thanks, son. I can hear it. I’m not sleeping,
just closing my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Germans! They’ve landed!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Only joking.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Bloody gin. Always makes me cry.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Got some wires crossed. Only weeps when she’s
happy.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re making me start now.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Now, now Grace.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Root it out Clive… the thought of it, before it
takes hold.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Weeds will grow, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my
own. And you.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Kiss me Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why couldn’t I have the kids? Is he sitting
up there… saying… “Grace, yes; Molly, no?”</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Better off, Molly. What’s to become of the
poor mites!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last
Lot.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon
as I will.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What did we know? We were seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac,
marching past. Made my hair stand on end. I thought, I’ve been asleep
for twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Go the Hell.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Do you know what time it is? Go back to bed,
this instant.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’re not going to be like them when we grow
up. We’re not even like them now.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He’s never going to come back. He’s gone off to
be a soldier and Mummy doesn’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It doesn’t matter, I can drive the car
home.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Would.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Could.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Sorry, kids. Joined up. I needed some Dutch
courage to tell your mother.</p>
<p><strong>pal</strong>: Never say die!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Steady the Buffs.</p>
<p><strong>pal</strong>: Up the Arsenal!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: He’s one of the best.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Daddy you shut his hand in the door.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: The silly bugger.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: You silly bugger. We’re trying to win a war
and you start off by shutting your fingers in the bloody car door.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: That’s it for the duration. I shall miss the
old girl. Pop in and give her a polish, Billy boy. Just now and then. A
car needs to be cherished.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Has Sue got it right?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You joined up.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Oh, that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I wish you could have told me yourself. Oh,
Grace, it’s not for long. They say it’ll be over by Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t be so daft. Act your age. I can’t cope
on my own. I’d better let the children go.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Billy boy. Before I go, there’s something I
want to tell you. You’re old enough now. It’s time. The Googly. Your
hand is too small to master it, but not to start practising. Anyway, I’m
going to pass on the secret now, father to son, in case anything happens
to me. You know the off-break, right?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And the leg-break?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but
it’s really an off break. Got it? Like this.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s like telling fibs.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: That’s it. When you tell a lie, you hope to
get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A
good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always
remember that, son.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dad! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You survived that. The war should be no
problem.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s. woman</strong>: Australia?</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s. woman</strong>: Say goodbye and pass them through.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m going to miss the war and it’s all your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I can’t do it. What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s just the wrench, Grace. It’s for their
sake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Let me through, I want my children.</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s. woman</strong>: No one goes in there. You signed the
forms, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes, I did. And now I want them back.</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s. woman</strong>: Too late. Plenty of others would’ve
been glad of their places.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Let me alone. I want to go. I want to go.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: In front of everybody. They were all looking
at us. Why did you have to do it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please yourself. Let them go, if they
want.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Grace!</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s. woman</strong>: Changed your mind?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>w.v.s woman</strong>: Well, you’re too late. Apply again. On
your head be it.</p>
<p><strong>victor sylvester</strong>: Slow, quick, quick, slow. Right
forward.. left together.. Three, four.. Back together.. Turn.. One,
two.. Quick, quick, slow.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You know it? It must be an old one.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Ancient. Have you finished your homework?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: After this dance.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ve got to move the Germans to Minsk. They’ve
taken Minsk.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Tomorrow. Give them one more night of
freedom. Move them in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Quick! Lord Haw-Haw! He’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>lord haw-haw</strong>: ..the soldiers like to wager among
themselves, what day will the German army enter Moscow? One thing is
certain: much sooner than anyone thought. From here in Berlin, listeners
in Britain, I can give some very definite news. There will be a bomber
raid on London tonight, the fourteenth night in succession. Look out for
bombs if you live in Carshalton or Croydon. There will be incendiary
attacks if you live in Fulham and Hammersmith. And watch out in Kew; be
alert in Walthamstow.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s us.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s just German Propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He always knows.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Half the time he’s bluffing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bill, off to bed.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We better go to the shelter.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s freezing out.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What would we do if a German came into the
house?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t be silly, Dawn.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well, why do you always bring the carving
knife in here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Flak!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Basket bombing Counts between the bombs Two
and three and four and five and six and..</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why didn’t I take you to the shelter?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …four and five and six and…</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If only I’d let you go to Australia.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …and five and six and…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it
goes past us.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …and four and five…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans.
She’s a cow.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …and six…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m not going to die like a rat in a trap. Let
me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m going outside.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wait. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Quick, quick.. slow, quick, slow.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s lovely. Lovely. Does little Billy want to
see the fireworks?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shrapnel! And it’s still hot.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come in at once, or I wash my hands of
you.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Oh fuck… oh fuck… oh fuck…</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Dressing from the right!</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Late! My study before prayers.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Eyes front! Keep still down there, you
little ones. It’s discipline that wins wars.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Now quick march. Left… right… left…
right. Swing those arms.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Oh God, bring destruction to our
enemies. Make these young one’s true soldiers of the Lord. Guide
Mr. Churchill’s hand in the cunning war.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Let our righteous shells smite down the
Messerschmitts and the Fokkers.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Lord, send troublesome dreams to Herr
Hitler. Let him not sleep the sleep of the innocent. And comfort our
warriors at the fronts. Brighten their swords, burnish their bullets
with your fire.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: We beseech Thee, Oh Lord, to have mercy
on these Thy children.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: We dedicate our studies this day to the
war effort.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Pink… pink… pink… pink… What are the pink
bits, Rohan?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They’re ours, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Yes, the British Empire.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Harper, what fraction of the earth’s
surface is British?</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: Don’t know, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Two-fifths, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Yes. Two-fifths. Ours. And that’s what the
war is all about. Men are fighting and dying to save the pink bits for
you ungrateful little twerps.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Books away! Scramble!</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Gasmasks on!</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Slowly… in… out…don’t panic… in…
out…</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: In… out… These masks are given to us to
filter away abominations of the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Now, nine times table. One times nine is
nine…</p>
<p><strong>headmaster</strong>: Two times nine is eighteen…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can’t we just see the end?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: They’ve got the real thing outside.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s not the same.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: England is so beautiful, and he had to land
here of all places.</p>
<p><strong>constable</strong>: Now then. Now then.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s crooked. Rub that bit out and do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well, keep going. Don’t stop now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nobody is going to see this far up.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Don’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: When I jitterbug.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It was great for me, how was it for you.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: A bit too quick.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some
kind of stockings you’re wearing?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: They might be.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda’
disappear up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Quit it. Help me someone. The girl’s beating
on me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mind that shrapnel</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m starting my own collection.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s Canadian. Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bill, Sue. Air-raid!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Dawn, what have you been up to?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m not going to that shelter. I’d sooner
die.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Dawn! Come down here!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Please, God. Take me, but spare them.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You don’t care if I die. How could you leave
me there? Even if you don’t love me?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Tell me the truth. You had to get married,
didn’t you? Because of me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: The ideas you get in your head.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: That’s why you never liked me. I’m different
from you. Well, everything’s different now, so it doesn’t matter. So
there.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Pauline’s mum got killed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Yes, she did, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes, she did. Killed stone dead.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: You can ask her. Ask Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Isn’t that right? You’re mum got killed last
night?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: There you are. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Do you feel rotten, Pauline?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Go and ask her if she wants to play.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ask her yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You do it. You’re a girl.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Pauline. Do you want some shrapnel?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Do you want to play?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hey, Terry. Pauline’s mum got killed last
night.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She never.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: She did too.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Pauline’s mummy got deaded.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You’re lucky up here. The East End’s been
burning for three nights. Incendiaries.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. evans</strong>: Touch wood.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You had a near-miss the other might.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. evans</strong>: I hear they’re dropping diseased rats on
bomb sites.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: BILL found this tiny little parachute. So
that’s what it was for.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: Is the piano all right, Grace? It was knocked
clean over.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It seems to have survived.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Play something, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: We never used to sing much before the war,
did we? Not in daytime anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. evans</strong>: Dawn’s come on fast.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: That’s the war for you. Quick, quick,
quick.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. evans</strong>: Didn’t I see you with a soldier,
Dawn?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m just doing my bit for the war effort.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I won’t have this vulgar talk in my
house.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s only a joke, Mummy. I’m fifteen. I’m
still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Try and few bars of old Fred, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Tell them about Pauline’s mum.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Not now. They wouldn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: What are you doing here? This is our
territory</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Looking for shrapnel.</p>
<p><strong>a boy</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>a boy</strong>: Look, a detonator.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Unexploded.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You were spying.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I never was.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Yes, you was. Make him talk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know a secret.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Germans are dropping men on bomb
sites.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My uncle’s in the War Office. He said, Don’t
go on the bomb sites. “Boys are going missing all the time.”</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: They’re not.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If you find them hiding, they cut your throat.
They have to, or they’d get found out.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I wish one would come through the door now.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: You want to join our gang?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Do you know any swear words?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Say them.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well go on then. You can’t join if you can’t
answer.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I only know one.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well say that one then.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: That word is special. That word is only for
something really important. Now, repeat after me… Bugger off.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bugger off.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Sod.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sod.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Bloody.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bloody.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody
sod.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bugger off, you bloody sod.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: OK. You’re in.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Let’s smash things up.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: This is top secret.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: They pulled them up from all the crossroads,
so when the Germans land they’ll lose their way.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Won’t they have maps?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: They’ll have to go to a shop to buy a map,
stupid. Then they’ll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ven der Fuhrer says Vis iss der master race, Ve
vart, vart, vart, Right in der Fuhrer’s face.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You go to bed this minute and take off that
lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: No, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You wouldn’t dare defy me if your father was
here.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: If you’ve finished, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I want him. I want him so much. I’ll kill
myself if I can’t have him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There, there, my baby.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Go if you want. What does it matter? We might
be all dead tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I can’t go like this.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You better bring him home, if you really love
him. Don’t kill love. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Who said anything about love?</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Want to see our den?</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: We got a bed.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Go on, Pauline. Be a sport.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No, I won’t. There’s too many of you.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: One at a time.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I’ll give you something.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: All right. Line up.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: I seen better.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It won’t bite you.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Pack it in. It’s time to smash things up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Teach him a lesson. Think they can come over
here and take our women.</p>
<p><strong>boy 2</strong>: Wasn’t that your sister, Rohan?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You need suspenders for this kind.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m going to cross my legs and make that
rustling noise.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Steak! I can’t remember the last time…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: crooning ironically</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Take it away. I know your husband’s been away
a long time, but….</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Don’t be so cheeky, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry, sorry. Too long in the barrack
room.</p>
<p><strong>churchill</strong>: If the British Empire lasts for a
thousand years, men will say, this was their finest hour.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Oh, do let’s listen to this. I never tire of
listening to it. I gives me goose pimples.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You haven’t been taking your orange
juice.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t sound the Dunkirk I was at. I saw no
fighting. We did a lot of running backwards, though. Then we got to the
beach and we couldn’t run no more. And Jerry just sat there and let us
alone. If he’d come after us, boy</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How can you say such things? Can’t you hear
what happened?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I was there.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: God laid his hand upon the waters and they
were still. The armada of little boats brought their precious cargo into
safe havens. They lived to fight another day.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He who turns and runs away lives to fight
another day.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t care what you say. It filled our
hearts that day. The little people stood up for once against the tyrant.
Stood up and said no!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s how we put up with the bombing and the
rationing, because of Dunkirk. Because of the spirit of Dunkirk, and
because of that we shall never give in, never.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: On the bike for five hours. Only got a
thirty-six hour pass.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Hand me my backpack, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Jam.</p>
<p><strong>bill and sue</strong>: Jam! Jam! Jam!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Jam? What kind of jam? It’s not like any jam
I know.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: German jam. It’s German jam.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: It’s all right. It came from a German chip.
It got sunk, and this stuff washed ashore, crates of it. Jam. Our
fellows found it on the beach, by the rifle range.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We don’t know anything about it</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Well, it’s off ration. We know that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How do we know they didn’t plant it there?
They know we’re mad on jam. They could poison half the country.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Come away, children. I don’t want you to
stand too close while he’s opening it.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It looks….foreign.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Jam is jam! It’s just jam!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well, I’m not having any. Even if it’s not
poisoned. I don’t think it’s right. It’s not patriotic.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You don’t like jam. You hate jam. You never
eat jam.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Taste it. Why don’t you taste it?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You taste it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Give us some, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You mean they let you go through the officer
training course and then said you were too old for a commission?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Why didn’t they say that before you
started?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I wasn’t too old when I started the course. I
was too old when it finished.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What are you going to be then?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: A clerk. I’m doing a typing course. I’ll be
typing for England.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Poor Clive. You wanted it so much.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re such a baby.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s lovely jam. It’s nearly as nice as
English jam.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: You know what I always say? Jam is jam, the
world over.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Bruce, this is my father. Dad, this is
Corporal Bruce Carey.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We thought it was poison.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The poison was at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: When do you think you’ll get leave again?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Not till Christmas, I don’t suppose.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I’m glad you didn’t send them to your
aunt.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ve had a letter from her. They’ve moved
house.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Woolamaloo.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Not Woolamaloo?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Woolamaloo? We would have lived in
Woolamaloo?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, oo. Upon my word, it’s
true. It’s the way to spell Woolamaloo.</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: I bet you a dollar, There isn’t a
scholar, To spell it right first go, O, W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, Loo-O</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in
Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is
getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I
knew what it was about.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Did you? You thought you did. We’ve been
gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it’s
certainly not an avenue.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You need trees for an avenue.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: There was talk of planting some when we first
came.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Propaganda. We’ve been had.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: How’s your war, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Except the servicemen.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I don’t understand. Is there any point to
it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We’ve
got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Look at how wild the boy’s got. As for Dawn.
Sixteen, going around with a soldier. Keep and eye on them for me, Mac,
there’s a pal. I’ve made a mess of it all. I’ve been such a bloody
fool.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Bugger the Buffs.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Take cover! We’re being attacked by our own
balloons!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s having a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s so wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Don’t panic! Keep your head!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I will if you will!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He just got fed up with all the other boring
old barrage balloons and decided it was time to have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boo! Leave it alone!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They’re scared of old fatty.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why did they have to go and do that?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: God, how I hate all this scrimping and
squalor.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t mind it. It was harder before the
war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it’s patriotic to be poor.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I don’t know how you cope, Grace. Three kids,
army pay. On your own.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You know something, Molly? I like it on my
own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I love a man in bed, the smell of him, the
hairiness rubbing against you, the weight of him. And when they do it to
you in the middle of the night and you don’t know if you’re dreaming or
it’s really happening to you. That’s the best. No guilty feelings. Not
that I should have any, wide awake.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Molly!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Well! I’m not talking about Mac. He hasn’t
toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went
on nights.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’re having me on, Molly.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Am I? Maybe I am.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You’ve been drinking. Your tipsy.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Tipsy, topsy, turvy.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I suppose they’re still learning, that’s why
they keep moving about.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s easy. I’ve done it.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Who with?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top
of her. That’s what they do when they know how.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Boy, that was some air-raid.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Air-raid?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Didn’t you feel the house rock? You must have
seen all those shell bursts.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Let’s get married. We’ll live in Montreal.
I’ll teach you French. Je t’aime, mon petit chou.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Don’t get smoochy. You’ll spoil it.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mac, that was wonderful. I haven’t been to a
concert since…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …since I used to take you to the Proms?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That’s right. Not since then Not since I got
married.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: He was a lot better this year.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You said that last year, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: The land and the King are one, my son. If he
stutters we falter. He’s getting batter, and so are we.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Dad’s furious. It was ‘God Save The King’.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jam tart! Jam tart! I got it! I got it!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Jesus Christ! This is Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: The for my annual toast. Charge
your glasses.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: To Mary McDonald, Thelma
Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson… …Little Sarah Whats-it, now
there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Father, that’s enough now</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: And…and…Henry Chapman’s girl,
was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes…I’ve lost your name,
my sweetness.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: Do we have to listen to this nonsense every
year? You’re drunk, Dadda. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: …Betty Browning…Betty, let me
tell you something. I’m seventy three years old, I’ve seen half the
wonders of the world and I never laid eyes on a finer sight than the
curve of Betty Browning’s breasts…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It was Sheila, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Henry Chapman’s daughter. It was Sheila. I
remember her from last year.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: So it was. Sheila. This boy will
go far.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I made it up!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We’re not supposed to say, but we’re being
shipped out tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You do, you do. You’re just not saying.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I swear I don’t know. Here’s your Christmas
present.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You expect me to spend the rest of the war
sitting at home staring at a ring? And you’ll meet some French girl who
can speak your own language. No thank you!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Please yourself.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What is it, pet?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He’s being posted. I was terrible to him.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Don’t leave it like that. Go after him.
Swallow your pride.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: We’ve missed them. They’ve gone. Can’t you
tell me where? You can see I’m not a spy.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I would if I could, but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: He’ll write as soon as he can.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sure, he will. You’ll meet again don’t
know where, don’t know when. But in the meantime, I am free tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I found it! I found it!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You needn’t have bothered, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: That letter this morning, was it from
Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He said I was right. I shouldn’t wait for him.
I was better to make a clean break.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I think it’s very sensible in the
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Now he’s gone and made me fall in love with
him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile
range, they have.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: They send over a few every day, to let them
know we’re still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who pays for them?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We will, you will, for the rest of our
lives?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers.
Out two families, together.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Happy days. When you’re bigger, Bill, I’ll
teach you the googly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: There’ll be blue birds over, The white cliffs
of Dover…</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: …tomorrow. Just you wait and see…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There goes another Ford 8, Uncle Mac.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off
with?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A Polish pilot. It’s like one of those jokes on
the wireless.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You miss her. I know you do.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: She said, ‘I know you love me, Mac, but you’ve
never loved me enough.’</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing
to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something
back.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s all better left unsaid, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept
asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And
you never did.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Clive had a job. I didn’t. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: He could always make me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We did the decent thing.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: This war’s put an end to decent things. I
want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing
back.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We can’t change what’s past. Not even the war
can do that.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: We did all the proper things, and we lost
love. That’s sad, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: If I saw this at the pictures, I’d be crying
my eyes out, but I can’t shed a tear for myself.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Dawn! Dawn!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank God you’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>firechief</strong>: Was this your house, madam?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I didn’t know there was a raid.</p>
<p><strong>firechief</strong>: It wasn’t a bomb, just afire.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you mean, a fire?</p>
<p><strong>firechief</strong>: It happens in wartime as well, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I just wished I’d worn my nylons.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: My ration books are in there.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My shrapnel collection should be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>firechief</strong>: Oh yes, I should think so.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Mac, look! Some of the snaps are saved.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. evans</strong>: This coat should fit you Grace. And here
are some things for Dawn. And a few bits for the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Thank you, Evelyne.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: It’s only a house. We still have each
other.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t care about the house, I just hate all
these people watching us and being nice.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Coming. Coming. Deliverance is
at hand. All will be well.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Another world, eh Billy? And not twenty miles
from Picadilly.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Are you strong enough for another shock?
You’re going to be a grandma. Hello, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I don’t believe this is happening to me.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It’s not. It’s happening to me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: responding to GRACE</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What did I do to deserve this?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You married that fool, Clive,
that’s what. Never mind, you can stay with us.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Three and a half months.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: As long as that? Well, all
right. Why not? It’s nearly summer. Let the nippers run wild.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Bless you, Mac. What would I have done
without you?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You might still have a house.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I wish it could all have been different.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Look after yourself, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Everything I have left in the world is in
this little boat.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can I try?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Put your hand on mine, get the
knack of it.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: I shall teach you the ways of
the river. Another year in that awful suburb and you would be past
saving. Look, they’re coming this way! The future on the march. I curse
you, Volt, Watt and Amp.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Have a listen. See if you can hear
anything.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You’re icy cold. A shock like that could give
me a miscarriage. That’s an idea, do it again.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Breakfast, all!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Did they say how long it would take to get
new ration books, Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Up to six weeks, I think.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: How are we going to cope?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Nettle soup, like we did in the
Great War. Very nourishing. Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl
will be laying eggs soon. We’ll hunt, We’ll forage. We’ll overcome.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: What about tea and sugar. Clever Dick?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Keep still! Nobody move!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Mother!! Fetch my gun.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: What’s that, dear?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Never let a rat creep up on
you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping
when he ran off.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Up, two, three. Throw the pole
forward, let it slide through your fingers. Don’t push until it hits the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Now check that spinner.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No luck, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Good day, ma,am. Greetings
Edward.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: …such nice boys with straw boaters and
blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And
the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the
Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Wasn’t it lovely?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Let it go. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Stay put. Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Now there’s a lesson for life.
Never give up the punt for the pole.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: No word from Bruce, my pet?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: All men are beasts, darling.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: That’s what I like about them.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Dawn! Really!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: All hens and no cocks. Too many
women in the family. They’re a different species from us, Bill. Love
them, but don’t try to understand them. That road leads to ruin. Let’s
make a nuisance of ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You look frustrated, Hope. That
husband of yours still can’t rise to the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: I won’t have the husbands here.
All four married duds, including your mother.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: He’s a menace. He ought to be locked up.</p>
<p><strong>charity</strong>: Don’t let him get his claws into you Billy,
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: They’ll tame you if they can,
cage you and feed you tidbits. Better retreat to prepared positions.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Bags I bat first.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: That was a googly!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You’re a dark horse, bowling
googlies at your age. Toss me up another.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, you’re out, Grandpa. It’s my turn.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Want to know why they’re called
Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Your grandmother. She named them
after virtues I lack. That’s marriage for you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s only a game, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Where’s the fish? No fish, no
supper. Be off with you and don’t come back empty handed.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m scared of going back without any fish. I
hate Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Looks like a stray bomber. He’s lost his
squadron.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: This is going too far, young
man.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But Grandpa, you said…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: I concede I was insistent, but
how the Devil…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It looks a bit fishy to me.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: It’s like feeding of the five thousand.
It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Well,lad. So it’s miracles now,
is it?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: They’ll stink the place out by morning. Why
not invite all your friends to supper, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: I have no friends, only
relations.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Ignore him, the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dan! It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Keep going. Stay on this bank.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Give me a chance to explain.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m going to kill you, Sue Rohan.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Couldn’t write…secret posting…came as soon as
I heard about the baby.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I went AWOL to be with you. I’m a
deserter.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Oh, Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I missed you so much.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’m so glad you could come. Here we are, all
together again.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Happy as can be. In the old groove.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: So you’re going to be a grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And I’m still just a lad myself.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t bother to grow up. It’s no fun at
all.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: What can you do with four
daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up
with. They hated me for making them learn.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: And now we’re glad you did.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Here’s to music. And absent friends.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And absent bridegrooms!</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And the bride.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The bride.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And here’s to my CO. He’s wangled me a
posting close to home. He said your house burns down, your daughter gets
married, you’re always on compassionate leave. You might as well stay
down there!</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: I’ve found a bungalow to rent up the towpath,
Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such
a wonderful summer.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Fair enough. The river.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: The river.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And loyal friends.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: …and good and faithful wives.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: We hope, and trust.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And grumpy grandfathers.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Since you are shortly to join
our ranks, I throw down the gauntlet. A cricket match. You and Mac
against Bill and me. Back garden.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: You know Mac played for Surrey Seconds, and I
opened for the Indian Army. Are you sure…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s an olive branch. Take it. It’s the best he
can do.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: We’re putting you in to bat.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Fine delivery, Bill, Good length. Turned a
bit too.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Give him the you-know-what.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Very well, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I think it was a googly.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Googly. You didn’t spot it
either.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I taught him how and now he turns it against
me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: The law of life. Cruel, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The wicked old bugger.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: This boy will make his way in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Clive, go for the doctor. It’s Dawn. She’s in
labour.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Hot water! Lots of hot water!</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I don’t know. They always say that at the
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: She just went to the toilet, and it came
out.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Now take deep breaths, and push.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Why? It’s coming on its own. It doesn’t
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s all sticky.</p>
<p><strong>churchill</strong>: …it is not the end. It is not the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I scrumped it. I nearly got caught. They
chased me for ages.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You did that for me, and on the last day of
your holidays?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, for the baby, really.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You miserable little
tripe-hound. I’m the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup
of black market petrol to take you to school.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Only till they get you into the
local school.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You’ll be at home for the
weekends. Now shut up, or walk.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Strapping fellows playing silly
buggers with a war on. Outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: All you do is knock the sense
out of them and fill them up with muck.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Grandpa! There’s no school! It’s been hit by a
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: I have to hand it to you, Bill,
you come up with some good ones. Go back and take your medicine.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: You’re much more convincing when
you’re making it up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Grandpa, if you think of something hard
enough, can you make it happen?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather george</strong>: Apparently so.</p>
