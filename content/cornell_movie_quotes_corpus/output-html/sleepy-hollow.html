<p><strong>insert title</strong>: 1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York</p>
<p><strong>in the forest behind</strong>: the hooves of the black horse
rip underbrush. HOOFBEATS DEAFENING. A spur digs into the snorting
steed’s already bleeding flank.</p>
<p><strong>insert title</strong>: New York City</p>
<p><strong>constable one</strong>: Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I need your help with this.</p>
<p><strong>constable one</strong>: Constable Crane? Ichabod Crane… is
that you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes, it is me. But, not only me… I found
someone here…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Someone quite dead.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Burn it.</p>
<p><strong>constable one</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Just a moment… if I may. It is possible
this man was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: He drowned. Anyone could see.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There are surgical ways of telling how he
died… by the water in his lungs…</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: He will be burned pursuant to
statutes of health.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I could determine if he were dead before he
went into the Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Must we again hear these heretical
rantings?</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Yes, must we?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There is nothing heretical about science,
sir. The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years… procedural
study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Our first night watch is adequate against
fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure
justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to
fear from law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Have they nothing to fear
presently?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Without disrespect, look around you. We
overflow. As do our courts.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: And, with disrespect, Constable, if
jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: But, how many innocents rot here? And, how
many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our
streets?</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Very few, if any.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Even though I have seen confessions pried
from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: For one who calls himself a
Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Not Liberalism. Equanimity.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Um, sir… might I suggest…</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: There is a farming community
upstate, Constable… ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands. It
is named Sleepy Hollow. Within a fortnight, three persons have been
murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. The elders of
the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now,
just this very moment, I have chosen you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Chosen me?</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: These “methods” of yours… there has
been no practical application.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Not for lack of trying.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Just so. Granted. And so you take
your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has
tainted the place. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do
this for me?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I shall, gladly.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Excellent. Then, you are excused
till morning.</p>
<p><strong>high constable</strong>: Oh, and, Constable… Do make certain
that you meet with success. Otherwise… perhaps you should not come back
at all.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod’s p.o.v.</strong>: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a
mast pole with a crow’s nest basket atop. There’s a man in the basket
and a huge BELL.</p>
<p><strong>blindfolded woman</strong>: This is such a silly game.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Be a sport and stop complaining.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Play along. You must.</p>
<p><strong>blindfolded woman</strong>: There, I have someone. Am I
finished?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: You have to tell who it is.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: At least make a guess.</p>
<p><strong>blindfolded woman</strong>: I don’t know. Is it Brom
Bones?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Excuse me, Miss… They have a laugh at your
expense.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Forgive me, I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I… I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: We haven’t heard your name yet, friend.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Well, unless your name is Baltus, you
should not worry over mine.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: You need some manners.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Brom!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I have been sent from the city with a
letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: If we could speak alone.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina,
is it? Am I mistaken?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: They’re only children, father.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: That will be all, ladies. We are joined by
Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable. And to his left are, Clergyman
Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order
in their own ways.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: I myself am in charge of financial matters
and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth. And, lastly, this
fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need
every detail of the three murderings you’ve had, but, for now, I ask
only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I say, is there any one person suspect in
these acts?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: I was afraid of this.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Well, Constable… are you aware… to be
honest, you are not what we expected. We sent for the militia.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The militia?</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Why not tell us what you have
heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: All I know is three are slain, their heads
found severed from their bodies…</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: The heads were not found severed.
The heads were not found at all.</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman.
Taken back to hell.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: You have not been well informed of our
troubles, sir. If you would…</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: The Horseman… he was a Hessian mercenary,
sent to our shores by German princes to help keep Americans under the
thumb of England. However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in
trade for currency, he came willingly. For love of carnage.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Cut off his head with his own sword. It’s
a legend told for twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: But, only recently has the Headless Hessian
been seen prowling the Hollow, in search of a head to suit his
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Just a moment… Are you saying it is he?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: When a goblin leaps from the nether
world, others follow. Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow
and cheer his desecrations!</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: No one knows why he chose to now
to climb out from his grave.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: It is very clear why. Citizens
here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors. Their failed
faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan’s own.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen, but… who has seen
this Horseman?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Many have.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Then, name one person who has seen him with
their own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: While I will do everything I can to find
your assassin, I will look for a man of flesh and blood. Not some
goblin-demon from hell.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Gather round! Gather and quiet! The hour
has come to choose for this night. Each man’s name is in this box and
has been checked.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: May the Lord watch over him… “Jonathan
Masbath.” Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: No, father. Wait… He’s already been
up once. Why does he go again?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It is a lottery, son. It just as easily
might have been one of them.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Then… I go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No. You obey my wishes. Brom. Look after
him, will you?</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Someone leave him a horse.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You worry for naught, little man. Nothing
will harm him there. It is problems here on the ground you people need
begin to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Did they tell? It is something in the air
so that dreams come to everyone. According to the elders, an Indian
prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast
then still linger to this day.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Do you often make a habit of sitting on
strange men’s beds?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You are horribly old-fashioned, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Feel free to form your own opinion. Though
it appears you already have.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Well, I intended to apologize for the
behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I’ve made matters
worse. I’ll leave you to your business.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Excuse me… I should apologize. I, um… I…
have no great love of…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Other people?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Small talk.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: It might have been more. Might have been
positively grand talk.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Is it me, or are you this nervous around
all women?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Perhaps it is because your suitor’s hands
were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: My suitor?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The massive fellow… Brom. For someone you
call “friend,” he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: He has proposed to me twice.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Which may explain his temperament. To have
asked twice means the answer was “no” at least once.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I’ve read a great deal about your New York
City. Do be a dear and tell me all about it. Sounds like an
extraordinary place to live a life.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me
about the Headless Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Come out, devil… come….</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say
witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.
Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering
death as tribute. And, still others believe none of it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Are you so superstitious?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: To call a person superstitious is to imply
they fear magic, but not all magic is black.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There is no such thing as magic.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Really? Then… what is your rebuttal to
those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or
even in a teardrop?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Poets have silly notions about plants and
bodily secretions.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You are funny.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Constable, where are you going!?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Come back, sir… Madness.</p>
<p><strong>horseman’s p.o.v.</strong>: closing in on Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The Van Garretts died first; a man and his
son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was
next…</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: And now Jonathan Masbath.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why would he flee this direction, with so
much open ground to cross before he reached cover?</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: He would not have gone into the Western
Woods. No sane man would.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Van Ripper there…</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: … found the body this morning. You do
believe now, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Believe?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: You said yourself. What mere man
could have downed the Belltower?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse,
that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the
utterly fantastical.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: You need less big words, and more common
sense.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What is that you wear?</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: My talisman. It will, protect against the
Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it
is worthless.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Well… so much for common sense.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Was this Jonathan’s?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Yes. Seems he panicked across here and broke
two legs.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Who took the meat?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian
lives in the Western Woods.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: These woods of yours sound a bit crowded,
what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: There’s only one Lenape. He eats small animals
and lost children… and the occasional constable when he can get it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why did you move the body, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: To place it inside its coffin.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse
with a hoof this large?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Never. A shoe that size I would have
remembered.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Van Ripper. Can you show where the body
lay?</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: I can show exactly.</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: Here… in front of this oak, facing
north. Horrible…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: To the best of your recollection, where did
the open wound fall?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There was not much blood, was there?</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: I didn’t see none.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no
blistering or scorched flesh. How… ? Whatever weapon was used… it
cauterized somehow….</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It instantly burnt the wound shut.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I am not here for revenge. I am here to
bring justice.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Whatever. You still need a second to
tend to your things.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I manage fine alone.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: I deserve to help you. Don’t you see
how much this means? My father… he… he was a good man…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It
is a great and sad tragedy. However… I cannot be the one to look after
you now.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: I did not ask you to, did I?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Hail, Constable. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Well enough. Your gathering does honor to
the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: We must be a curious sight to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What are you spying on?</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: The Lenape. He comes to gawk at
civilization from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He is a behemoth.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: A diseased monster.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: If you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and
I… we have financial matters to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Master Crane, sir. I’m glad we have time
alone. You’ve been told plenty about the Horseman, I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: More than enough, actually. I beg you, no
more, please.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just
laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Tell me something. What becomes of Young
Masbath?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.
They have children and a good home and good land.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Find yourself a place in the servants’
residence and wake me before dawn. Our first task will be an unsavory
one.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: It is sacrilege!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I cannot proceed without examining the
previous victims.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Magistrate Philipse, surely you
can stop this.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: I will not allow it. I will
not!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Protest to my superiors if you like.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Your superiors are two days
away!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Then, you should have left two days ago,
because I have men willing to help me today.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why was I not told of this?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: The Widow Windsor.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Is that all you say? Look at her.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: It’s not something people speak of openly.
She did not remarry.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What is the common thread between these
victims?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: I’m sure I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We must discover it. The reason the
murderer chose these persons.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No
chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head. Have you
seen, doctor… ? Even the spinal bone… sliced as smooth as butter.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: I do not care. You are welcome to
use my work area, but I beg you… return her to her resting place.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You should step outside.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
The Lord will not forgive your sins.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Ichabod! Ichabod… come along.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Sorry for disturbing you. I thought a
forgotten candle was burning.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You do not disturb me. Please stay. Having
trouble sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: May I ask… why do you cover your book that
way?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You pay great attention to small things. I
hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it
were the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I, um… I have something to show you, if you
have a moment.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: These are strange… may I?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: These scars. How did you get them?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I have had them since childhood. I cannot
remember what from.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: It would be interesting to find out.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on
the other. Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Yes, he does. May I try?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He only appears to be inside the cage. The
point being…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You made this, and the drawings?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily
explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some
would call this toy magic.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Don’t you see why? Look closely a moment.
Put your intellect aside. Can’t you see what is inexplicable?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at
least?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: If you want. But…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Then, I also have a gift for you. True
magic which even you will not be able to deny.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Thank you. No. Here…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I insist that you have it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Very well. But, it will only sit gathering
dust.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: That would be a pity. Those words might
show you something you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man
for stealing a horse. For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our
dead.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Are you saying I should be frightened? Is
this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: We are farmers here, not lawyers or
bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send
down the Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Um…. excuse me, sirs…</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Because of the Horseman, our migrant
workers flee for their lives. There is a danger that our crops will rot.
So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman. That is your
task… to kill an undead thing.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Listen to what you say….</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: No, you listen! You may think we are a
pack of superstitious dullards…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: At times I do.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Sirs… please!</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: What will it take for you to realize this
is no laughing matter?</p>
<p><strong>philipse</strong>: Oh my… oh my oh my oh my…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Philipse!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Has he not come out at all?</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: No… mother… no… !</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: You are certain it was she?</p>
<p><strong>freakish woman</strong>: In the lighting, I did see her. Her.
Lady Crane…</p>
<p><strong>freakish woman</strong>: I will never forget. The next
moment, I found my infant dead… with the blood welt on his breast.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t be afraid…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You promised justice.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: If these are the random stalkings of a
monster, what good am I?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: People have put their trust in you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: They have done nothing of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Won’t they still have that justice? Or, was
it a vain promise?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Constable Crane… something has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: The men who did this have been taken. We do
not need you here.</p>
<p><strong>one filthy man</strong>: You should thank us. The killings
will end. We saved you all!</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: They spend two days in chains.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Two days… ? For murder?</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: For poaching. Or, would you remake
our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Does that look like an animal hanging?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Looks like an Indian.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Wait. Give me a moment…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I
opened his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: How could he?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped
off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done
that for himself. Someone out there cared for him.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: It’s payment day. Loan monies are
given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows… for
tools or to hire workers.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Out there. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: The Western Woods.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Look again.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Smoke. Chimney smoke.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Are you familiar with magnets?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What kind of nuts?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Not for eating, I assure you. Watch
here.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: It’s spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes… I suppose it is. Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: No, I couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I have others. All I need is this.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to
business.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: If the Western Woods are truly the Devil’s
Glen, we will see for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Father said witches live there.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Witches do not exist. However…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Not long ago, I would have said the same
for Headless Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I need to speak with you. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Why would you do such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No stone may be left unturned. It may
appear harsh…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I have misjudged you I think. I did not
imagine you were so cruel.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You are not regarding it in full. The Widow
Windsor had been run through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound,
a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman
with my own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What are you on about?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The child she carried was eight months
grown at least… near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Must I hear this?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There was no blind stabbing. This singular
thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain
the unborn child died with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: And this gives worth to butchery?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It was not butchery.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What is it then? Scientific method? How can
any of this matter in the slightest?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I have no solution for its meaning yet, but
I could not just ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Take a lesson from Young Masbath’s desires,
Ichabod Crane. He follows with you to avenge his father’s death. That I
understand. But, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: To avenge his father, and the others.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: But, why? Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You falter with your answer because you
strive without putting the whole of your heart into it. Can’t you see?
You’ll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into
little pieces to do it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: If it had been surgery on a living person,
done to save that person’s life, you would not question it. Not for a
moment. So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl… on the other
side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond
such plebeian thinking as yours. And someday, no matter how much you
fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its
slumber.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I hear nothing.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: No crickets or cicadas calling. No
bird songs.</p>
<p><strong>elsewhere, someone watches</strong>: A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES
them as they ride, FOLLOWS.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We have apparently arrived.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked.
Are we intruding?</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: You are from the Hollow?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: In a way, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The Lenape who lived in these woods… do you
know him? The Redman? I should tell you… he has been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: Leave me. You are not welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Were you a friend to the Indian? You
should have this… if you were his friend.</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: You seek remedy against the Horseman?</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: Go out and keep away, child. You stay.
Follow with me.</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and
back.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The Horseman. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: You want to see into the nether world… I
can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold
him.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What… what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: Close your mouth! Keep silent.</p>
<p><strong>old crone</strong>: He comes now.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Excuse me… um…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Are you alright… ?</p>
<p><strong>creature/old crone</strong>: You seek the warrior bathed in
blood… the Headless Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>creature/old crone</strong>: Follow the Indian trail to where
the sun dies. Follow to the tree of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>creature/old crone</strong>: Climb down to the Horseman’s
soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking. Do you hear? Do you
hear?!</p>
<p><strong>creature/old crone</strong>: He who holds fast the Horseman’s
desire will guide his reaping hand. Catch hold of his desire.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We are leaving.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Follow the Indian trail to where the
sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: How could something named “the tree of the
dead” fail to draw attention?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We should not go much further in this
murk.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Should we go back?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say
it… better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What does it mean… climb down to the
Horseman’s soulless place?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: “Let loose his silent shrieking.” Who
knows, till we work at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. “He
who holds the Horseman’s desire will guide his reaping hand.” Whatever
the Horseman’s desire is, other than extinguishing lives.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Do not move.</p>
<p><strong>another angle, moving p.o.v.</strong>: low to the ground,
moving swiftly at Ichabod…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What God-forsaken hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Christ…</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: You all stand idle, while this man
goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic. You all
stand idle, while the shadow of the Devil falls over our town.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: I say, if you do nothing, you
share in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Listen to me! Do you want to save your
crops? Or would you rather see your farms go to ruin?</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: How is he saving our farms? How?
Ichabod Crane has brought into our midst the soulless, moldering corpse
of a heretic!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized,
but jagged. She bleeds like a fountain.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: She did not go quietly.</p>
<p><strong>angry man</strong>: Step aside, Constable. Step aside…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Let her burn! Let her burn!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Stop this! Leave them alone!</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Let them go Are you going to beat an orphaned
child, imbecile?</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Are you Ichabod Crane’s protector,
Brom Bones?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Only for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: You side with him in this?</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: No. I agree he has only made matters worse.
But, that will change, if you listen.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day
and night to watch over the Hollow. We will stalk the border of the
Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like
this… and slugs like this…</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Hollowed out and filled with powder.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Constable Crane is not the only one who fights
with science on his side.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet
did nothing.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: You must have missed your mark.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I hit him square.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: I say… if the Horseman is solid enough to take
the lives of our people, he’s solid enough to feel this…</p>
<p><strong>freakish woman</strong>: In the lightning, I did see her.
Her. Lady Crane… I will never forget it. The next moment, I found my
infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: You have heard it. The blood welt is the
mark of Satan’s touch.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: She was with me, father.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Nothing can be done against them.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: She was with me that night.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: May I see her?</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: May I see my mother?</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: You do not want to be here. Go home to
your father.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: She did not do it… please listen…</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: She is guilty.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: No, sir, please… she is innocent…</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: She has confessed.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: She has admitted to her evil and signed a
written confession. Do you know what confession is? All that is left for
you now is to pray for her soul.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: We are leaving. She has gone away.</p>
<p><strong>young ichabod</strong>: Mother.</p>
<p><strong>devices</strong>: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and
needles.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Constable Crane?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Allow me some time. I have spent every hour
in the company of others. I need to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What troubles you?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: The things I said to you before… I was
wrong to say them.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No, actually, you were not. Every word you
spoke had truth in it.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Lady Van Tassel… she is your stepmother,
isn’t she? She bears so little resemblance.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: She is not your birth mother, is she?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: No, but… why do you ask that?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What happened to your mother? Is she still
alive?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: She died. Her lungs were diseased… two
years ago. What is this about?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Memories have come back. I had them
forgotten, and wish I could forget them again… but they are here now.
Lord, how I hate this place.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: If you want me to go, I will. Do you want
me to leave?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I… I do not know. I no longer know what I
think or what I feel.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Why are you so afraid of that? Is there
truly such harm in uncertainty?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Returning to the Western Woods?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes, actually.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Use caution.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Do you know… I think those are the first
words I have heard from you my entire time here.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: As my husband says, a wife should
be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. Like
an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he
believes.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Constable… did you notice anything out of
the ordinary during the night?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Um… I… I did not… no. Why?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Sarah has gone missing… my servant girl. Her
things are gone. Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. What
about breakfast, woman? Or, am I to starve to death?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I should be going… good day to you.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: If the Crone’s wound bled hard, that
means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it
look that way.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You grow sharper by the minute, little man.
It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all
others.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Well… I’m one of the few people who
likes you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: True enough.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And
why?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Good questions, deserving answers, of which
we are in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Quicken pace.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Ride on.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Halt and turn. I have a pistol aimed at
your head.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: It is only me.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Katrina. Why do you follow?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I apologize if I worried you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: A woman should not be out alone in these
woods.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: But, I am not alone, am I? I only wished to
see what you were up to, and… To thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Come along.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: You were right… it does draw
attention to itself.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Stay back.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Just… keep where you are.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: My God… what has happened?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He… he tries to take the heads… they will
not pass.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this
place… ?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: We should go.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why this tree?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: “Climb down to the Horseman’s soulless
place.” Bring the shovel.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Masbath, we’ve found it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It cannot be true.</p>
<p><strong>we see</strong>: roots have gripped the Horseman’s bones and
tattered uniform. The skeleton is all there – except the skull.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why is it every grave I open holds a new
mystery inside?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: The skull is gone.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes. I did notice that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: This is his silent shrieking… and his
desire, to reclaim his head.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: “He who holds fast the Horseman’s desire
will guide his reaping hand.” Someone controls the Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: His next victim is chosen! Give me
distance, then guide her back to the Hollow.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Constable!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: May I be excused, father?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Do you deserve to be?</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Then, go.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t pick teeth. You teach Thomas bad
habits.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: I am a bad habit. There’s nothing for
it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No one knows better than I.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Spiders.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Beth…</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Beth… run!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t let him get you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You hide now… go…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: For what it’s worth…</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: We cannot win this.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Go to the front and guide it.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: Let’s see him catch us now.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: We’ll pass right by the son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>brom</strong>: My Christ…</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: water carries Ichabod, slams him against
ice above. He’s pulled down by undertow.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Doctor, he is awake.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What… what are you doing… ?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I’m drawing bad blood from the wound.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: Keep still, Constable. You were
half-drowned when they found you.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: … Brom Bones…</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: He is dead. You would be also, if
your wound had not somehow shut.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Bring Young Masbath here.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: You need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Bring him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: You need rest.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Someone left last night. Looked like
they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Man or woman?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: All I saw was their lantern.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Business, best hidden is hidden best at
night.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: If someone has the Horseman’s skull…
if they control the Horseman, then why haven’t they sent him for your
head yet?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It
is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing
more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these
victims were targeted. What was taken from them… other than their lives?
Who benefits by their deaths?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Panic has set in.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Sanctuary. Or, so they hope.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Do you have these persons’ wills?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: I have everything… last testaments…
birth certificates, death certificates… deeds.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Yes, sir… but, do you have these?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Certainly… certainly.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Hmm? See them?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: May we look at them now?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Of course. You want them… it shall not
take long. Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Maybe you should take this.</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: A fine idea.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What good is this?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: To discover what might have been taken from
those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken
in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Damn… damn… damn…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Master Hardenbrook…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Perhaps, I could assist in finding
them?</p>
<p><strong>hardenbrook</strong>: Well… that might be… helpful.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: My father had farm land. It was the
only thing we owned of any value.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: And it now belongs to you, according to
Baltus. I heard him say it.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Then look here at your father’s will, and
tell me why you are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in
his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him. But Van Garrett’s
wife and two infant children are not written… and they were spared. Do
you see? Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to. But, here… The
Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband’s will. After her
inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child. This
is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn
descendant.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the
Horseman slaughters by assignment.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: But, if the farm is not mine, who
stole it away?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone
intestate.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: In test… what?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Intestate. Your farm… all the farms… they
belong to no one.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Often in such cases, property which has
gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to.
And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Baltus Van Tassel.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Did your father take a loan?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Yes. I rode with him on payment
days.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Tonight, we answer questions. And, to
discover who moves about the Van Tassel house after dark… all we need is
a candle.</p>
<p><strong>moving past the windows</strong>: many eyes peer out from the
slats.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Midnight seems an appropriate time.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: They are alphabetical.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: There is no Masbath here. My father’s
loan papers are missing.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There are none for Magistrate Philipse
either. “Paasch, James” “Pieter, Thomas” “Pos, William.”</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Keep looking. Then, hide in my room and
bolt the door till I return.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: I was getting worried. Who was
it?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Lady Van Tassel.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What was she doing?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Something I really wish I had not seen.
Never mind it. Did you find the victims’ loan agreements?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: No. They are all missing.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: There is more, though. While you were
gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Katrina.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: There are no other doors. This is as
far as she could have gone.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It is nothing. She comes to read books, so
her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What books?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not
approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel
returns.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: But, sir… what books? Where are
they?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: If there is a secret place for books…
it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Constable.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Fie! Here they are.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel… Katrina is not
in her room.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: No. She has gone out.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: She has taken the last of our grain
to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don’t you,
Constable?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Very little. I must be going…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Will you look at this? I cut my
hand this morning: I sewed it myself, but I am afraid it will go
bad.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It appears well. It has already
clotted.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Look closer. Do you have anything
to clean it with?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It is fine. Now, I must…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: I know you saw me.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: I know you followed last night. You
must promise not to tell Baltus…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Have mercy on me. Please… have
mercy.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Constable, it is urgent that we speak.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.
This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: How did you hear this?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: He came to me. He promised great violence.
Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly.
There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: That is the meeting bell already calling.
With the murder of Killian and Brom, no one sees any good from you. If…
if you were to leave… you might be saving your own life.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I appreciate your concern. I thank you,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What now? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Things have become complicated. Katrina is
at the mill. Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the
church. Find her at all costs. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>in the church</strong>: it’s crowded with families. Pews
filled with bedding and belongings. Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: You are astonishing, Constable. Do
you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Only if I repeat them outside this room.
And, I will if I must… Out there, for all to hear. Or… you may speak, as
planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener
pastures.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: No. You will not run me out. No
one will believe a word of what you say.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not
travel alone for long here.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Are you a deist? Is that it? A
free thinker who does not believe in divinity.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It is only important what you are. An
adulterer…</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: I am the Lord’s voice in this
town.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Wallowing in sin and lust…</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: They need guidance.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Wallowing quite literally in blood.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: Damn you, sir! God damn you to
hell!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He may. But, not soon enough for you, and
not on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You are so upset now… and yet, you seemed
in such good spirits last night.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: You cannot do this. I am a man of
God!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you
can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: My friends… dear friends. Those of
you still on your farms, I thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>father steenwyck</strong>: I… I address unfortunate business.
I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow. I will be moving on to
do the Lord’s work elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Hurry along. The meeting has most certainly
already begun. We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What is so urgent?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Why have I not seen your face for so long?
You look much better.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Explain these. I found them secreted away
in the sewing room.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Why… why have I scrambled and run and
clawed in all directions, only to find you against me?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I have been reading your journal. I’m
sorry. I found it too fascinating to resist. I rode to catch up with you
at the Notary, out of curiosity. Before I found you though, I overheard
what you were said.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: It was you there?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: When… when you spoke father’s name along
with accusations, I could not believe it. I had to hide these… at least
till I could confront him myself.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: And, what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: He did not do these things. If you knew
him, you would realize…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What did he say, Katrina?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I have not been able to face him yet.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The loans give the land to your father. It
does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown
off… tomorrow… a year from now.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I
hid them.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: What would you have me believe?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: If you think I am behind this, say it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share
that name.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say
it, out and out.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Katrina…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Speak the words, Constable. What is
stopping you? What has happened to your ability to transcend
sentimentality?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Oh, no. No. Please… don’t dare stand
looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said. If I
were to confess, would that ease your suffering? Would that make it
easier for you to hate me?!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: The Horseman is coming!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Save me…</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: He killed her…</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: The Horseman has killed her.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Steenwyck!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: Damn you, Steenwyck! Help me! Let me in!</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: You’ll kill us all!</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: You’re the one the Horseman wants. Why
should we die for you!?</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Stop this!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The Horseman cannot enter! It does not
matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate!</p>
<p><strong>one rifleman</strong>: He’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: We have to save ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: No! Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: The next person to lay hands on me will have
a bullet. Stand off!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Father…</p>
<p><strong>baltus</strong>: No! We’re safe here. You said it. The
Horseman will not have me.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Here! I have found her… Here she is.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: It has been a terrible jolt to her
nerves.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You will stay at her side?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: She’s the one who controlled the
Horseman, isn’t she, sir? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I need time for thinking. Without you
hanging on my coattails for a change.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Won’t you change your mind, sir? What
can I say to convince you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Nothing. To hell with this place and all
the people here.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Why… why are you like this?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: You do not know all that has happened. You
cannot understand.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Half now. Half when we reach the city.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: This is farewell.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Take me with you. There’s nothing
left for me here.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper
and his wife will look after you. They will. You will be well cared
for.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I am sorry. Forgive me. I failed you.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Do not go, Constable. How can you
leave?</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: Sir… this is yours. The Van Tassel girl
said to give it to you after you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Van Ripper, turn the coach about!</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Turn around. Now!</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Hello? Katrina?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Pardon the intrusion…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I never examined these bodies.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: … help yourself, you pompous ass.
I will be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Would you stay, doctor? I may need
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Stains of blood.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: What of it?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Jagged flesh. The Horseman did not do
this.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Here, Doctor. Hold this just so…</p>
<p><strong>through the lens</strong>: the gash spreads easily, soft,
bloodless.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing
at all.</p>
<p><strong>doctor lancaster</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: When this cut was made, this person was
already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Katrina. Is anyone here?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Open the door. Open up, damn it! Lady van
Tassel is alive. The Horseman is her puppet. Please…</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: Aren’t we rid of you?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Listen to me. Lady Van Tassel has faked her
death. I need able men…</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: She’s dead, and you have gone mad.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>huge farmer</strong>: Get out! Isn’t it enough that you have
ruined this town? Go!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Van Ripper… do you have a gun?</p>
<p><strong>van ripper</strong>: Yes. Here…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: May I see it?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Get down. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: You… you are alive.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath
dead along with me?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: She commands the Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: And, quite beautifully done,
wouldn’t you say? It is almost over.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: He rides tonight.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Father saw you die.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: He saw me thrown… saw the Horseman
looming over me as I fled. Things I wanted him to see. But, as long as I
govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me. Baltus did not stay enough to
see that. He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Then, whose body was it… ?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: The precious servant girl Sarah. I
killed her and kept her body hidden, till I needed it. And, when I
return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to
pass. I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the
woods. I did not know what he was up to… where he was going. I worried
for his safety.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Imagine my surprise, finding him on
a liason with a common servant. A girl who had apparently become his
secret love.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: No one will believe your lies, whore.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: This whore will see your mouth shut
forever very soon. But… I am not going to kill you. Not me…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: He will have that honor.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Woe is me… that spying on my
husband in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he and Sarah attacked by the
Horseman. Oh pity me… so overcome was I that I wandered in the Western
Woods… dazed… nearly blind from terror.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: And, tomorrow is my grand
performance, having barely survived the elements… By sheer luck I found
my way back to the Hollow. But… what do I find here… ? My dear, sweet
step-daughter Katrina is dead. Why has God forsaken her?</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: No one will suspect this sad woman
who has been through such an ordeal. With only the empty solace of her
money and land to comfort her.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Katrina!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Murderer!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: You’ve been a naughty girl.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Ichabod!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Little bitch.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Ichabod!</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Here we are!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Run, Katrina! Fast as your pretty
legs will carry you. It makes no difference.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Nothing will stop him now!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Climb up!</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Lady Van Tassel…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I know. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Olly-olly oxen-free!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I do not know. Away.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We might make it to the church.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Masbath… !</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Damn it, boy, get back here!</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Take the reins.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Masbath is right. We must do something.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Ichabod!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Keep him off! Block him!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Move forward!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Help her.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: I doubt that’s the end.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: The church.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He moves too fast.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: His horse.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: He’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: It won’t hold.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Get up those stairs. Open the door to the
roof and wait.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Ichabod…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Keep climbing. I will follow…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Quickly, close it.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No. Get to the crest of the roof and be
ready to jump.</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Jump? Jump where?</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: The blades will carry us to the ground.
Face front and wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I… I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: We have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Be ready…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Okay… come on…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Should have stayed away,
Constable.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Keep back, or I kill her.</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: See him…</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: You cannot kill what is already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Yes… yes. I think I will…</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lady van tassel</strong>: Say goodbye to her.</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: Horseman!</p>
<p><strong>ichabod</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>young masbath</strong>: Tired.</p>
