<p><strong>seamen</strong>: Hold still you smutt! Blast the boat! Look
up! Look up! Lay to! Lay to. Up with it you buggerers, hold hard! Damn
me won’t you hold?! Etc.</p>
<p><strong>seamen</strong>: It’s a little rough out there. Could be they
can’t get through to you in this weather. Maybe they’ll come over
land.</p>
<p><strong>seamen</strong>: Have you things for shelter?</p>
<p><strong>seamen</strong>: What things have you?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She says, “thank you”.</p>
<p><strong>seamen</strong>: Does your mother prefer to come on with us
to Nelson?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She says, No. She says she’d rather be boiled
alive by natives than get back in your tub.</p>
<p><strong>seamen</strong>: You be damn fortuned I don’t smack your
puppy gob, missy. Damn lucky.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mother… I’m thinking</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Are we stopping?… Do you want to stop?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Shall we stop?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me tutatou I
konei.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: We must get on.</p>
<p><strong>tame</strong>: Aue tepatupsiarehe!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. You’ll have
to wake yourself. I’ve got men here to carry your things.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I see you have a good many boxes, I’d like
to know what is in each.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well that is good, yes that is good,
good.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What’s in here?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Ohh, yes so it is, written there,
crockery.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: And this one?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You’re small. I never thought you’d be
small.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What’s here?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What’s in here then, lead?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: It’s my mother’s piano.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: A piano?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Tell them to carry in pairs.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: She looks tired.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: She’s stunted, that’s one thing.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Anei nga pouaka - ko era e toro. Me era e
raa.</p>
<p><strong>hone</strong>: E Hoal</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Oh no, it can’t come now.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: It must come.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She wants it to come.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Yes and so do I, but there are too few of
us here to carry it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Do you mean you don’t want your kitchenware
or your clothes? Is that what you mean?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: We can’t leave the piano</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Let us not discuss this further. I am very
pleased….</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mother wants to know if they could come back
directly for it?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: After they have taken the other things?</p>
<p><strong>pito</strong>: Kei Riri a te raho Maroke.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I suggest you prepare for a difficult
journey. The bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What are they doing? We don’t have time for
that.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Mr. Stewart asked if I might show you to the
path. … May I carry something?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: aha tenei?</p>
<p><strong>hone</strong>: E hinga te Koroua ra B Pitama i konci. Kare
noa Kia hikina te tapu.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What’s he say?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Someone died here. It’s tapu.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: But we came down this way didn’t we? I’m
sure we did.</p>
<p><strong>hone</strong>: E Tarna heke atu ki ram - tiro his atu.
Rapuhia mai he huarahi re!</p>
<p><strong>tipi</strong>: ’cia tupato he ana taniwba ke raro na.</p>
<p><strong>hotu</strong>: ’Ca, rongo koe i te haunga a tans tutae i te
tuatahi.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: They want more money. They are trying to
make two days out of it?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, no they know another track - to the side
of this.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Watch your feet!</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: Watch your feet!</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Careful! Watch his hand.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: Watch his hand</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: We’ll bring out the bride.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: My REAL father was a famous German
composer</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Ohh the tag is broken.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: …. They met when my mother was an opera
singer… in Luxemburg…</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I want to be in the photograph.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: I thought she met your father in
Luxemburg.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the
Royal Orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: And where did they get married?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: In an enormous forest, with real fairies as
bridesmaids each holding a little elf’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: No, I tell a lie, it was in a small country
church, near the mountains</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Which mountains are those dear?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: The Alps.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Ohhh I’ve never been there.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mother used to sing the songs in German and
her voice would echo across the valleys</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Oh what happened?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: One day when my mother and father were
singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere.
But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did
they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the
final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky
and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch… And at the same
moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She-
never-spoke-another-word.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Ohhh … dear. Not another word From the
shock, yes it would be.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Terrible. Terrible</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I shall be gone for some days. There is
some Maori land I want and may buy very reasonably. I am hoping you will
use the time to settle in, and, in some ways we may start again</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: All right?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I’m not able to read.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Please take us to the beach where we
landed.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t do that. I don’t have the
time. Goodbye</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I - can’t - take - you there. I can’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Hello, then.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Well you stopped combing your hair,
which is a good thing, it was looking over done. You see these are the
slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie … they’ll be dead,
the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very
dramatic. Tea!</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: It will be very dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What would you think if someone played a
kitchen table like it were a piano?</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Like it were a piano?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: It’s strange isn’t it? I mean it’s not a
piano, it doesn’t make any sound.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Biscuits.’ No, no sound.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I knew she was mute, but now I’m thinking
it’s more than that. I’m wondering if she’s not brain affected.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: No sound at all?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: No, it was a table.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Well, she was very violent with the
gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn’t been there I’d have sworn
she’d used her teeth</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: and wiped her feet an it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well it has not yet come to anything. Just
a concern.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: There is something to be said for
silence</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Oh indeed. Cotton’.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: And with time she will, I’m sure, become
affectionate.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Certainly, there is nothing so easy to
like as a pet and they are quite silent.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what
do you think of them?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: On your property?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Good, flatish land with reliable water,
why? I don’t have money. What are you about?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I’d like to make a swap.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: The piano.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: The piano on the beach? Ada’s piano?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: It’s not marshy is it?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You’d have to organise it up here.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Yes, I thought that.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well Baines the music lover, I never would
have known. Hidden talents George.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I’ll have to get lessons. It wouldn’t be
much use without them.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Yes, I suppose you would.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well Ada can play.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I have it in a letter she plays well. She’s
been playing since she was 5 or6.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I have got us some excellent land. Baines
has taken some queer idea to have a piano, and you are to give him
lessons. Have you taught before?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: What on?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: On your piano, that is the swap.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What does she say?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She says it’s her piano, and she won’t have
him touch it. He’s an oaf, he can’t read, he’s ignorant.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: He wants to improve himself… and you will
be able to play on it … Teach him to look after it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You can’t go on like this, we are a family
now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you. You will teach him. I
shall see to that!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I’d try children’s tunes, nothing more
complicated</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Just be encouraging no one expects him to
be good.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: It looks good, very nice looking thing.
Well . I wish you luck. The girls are very excited about the
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Flora will explain anything Ada says. They
talk through their fingers, you can’t believe what they say with just
their hands.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: My mother wants to see your hands. Hold them
out.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: You have to wash them.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: They are washed.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Wash them again.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: The marks do not come out. They are scars
and hardened skin.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: There’s no tune left in the piano so she
can’t teach you.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Ah, a Broadbent. A fine instrument. I’ve
not come across one here, or in the Islands where I have tuned some 200.
Yes, they like their pianos there.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I can’t play.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: You don’t play?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but
silent.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mother says she can’t stand to teach piano
with it all out or tune. So I’m to do scales.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I hope you’ve scrubbed your hands.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: What’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: You have to watch me where I put my
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: It’s in tune.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I was teaching.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She wants to see what you can do.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I’d rather not play. I want to listen and
learn that way.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Everyone has to practice.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I just want to listen.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: What do you want to hear?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Tell me about my real father.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: What happened? Why didn’t you get
married?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Shall I kiss you goodnight?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Do you know how to bargain, nod if you
do.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: You see I’d like us to make a deal. There’s
things I want to do while you stay. If you let me you can earn it
back.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Your dress?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Play… Keep playing.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray
good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, no bible readers.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: Why? We need you pakeha clever. You sleep
her.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I have a wife.</p>
<p><strong>tahu</strong>: I give her clever eb Peini. Hallelujah!</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: Don’t answer, he low born. Jun look at him,
mongrel. Your wife where she?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: She lives her own life in New Jersey,
America.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana
for that. Our chief four wives.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: Who do that? It not finish, that no good
Peini. You finish!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I want to speak to my mother</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Which sign is the word rehearsal?</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: I can’t imagine a fate worse than being
dumb. Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: To be deaf?</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama
says most people speak rubbish and it’s not worth the listen.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Well, that is a strong opinion.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Yes, it’s unholy.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Lift your skirt,</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Higher.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: Nessie, your hand out … out here,
please.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: Oh, no use Mr Stewart, I can’t act.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: Nessie, please.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: Look you are being attacked!</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: And with the blood … it will be a good
effect:</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Undo your dress. This part, I want to see
your arms.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Play.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: I hardly need to give one to you, but
there you are anyway.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: How are the lessons going? ADA nods
enthusiastically. He’s getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: That is good, yes.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Ah well, slowly, slowly</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Ada, four keys.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: The Holly and the Ivy…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They’re bringing in extra seats!</p>
<p><strong>another woman</strong>: Oh God, don’t pin my hair too high
Alfred!</p>
<p><strong>still another</strong>: Yes, me too, do it about here …</p>
<p><strong>man one</strong>: Look who’s here, the musical MR BAINES What
will we have tonight George, “Twinkle, twinkle?”</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: ‘Mary had a little lamb’ or a polka,
come on George what’s it to be?</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Mr. Baines, do come and turn pages</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I can’t read music, I have just begun.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Lot of fools. Come on, move up.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: And so the young maid came upon each and
all of Bluebeard’s missing wives, their severed heads still bleeding,
their eyes still crying.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: But who it this?</p>
<p><strong>bluebeard</strong>: I am home early my sweet wife … where art
thou?</p>
<p><strong>young wife</strong>: Hello husband, what a surprise!</p>
<p><strong>bluebeard</strong>: Yes wife, a surprise indeed! So now you
know my secret you, the sweetest and youngest or all my wives must be
prepared to die.</p>
<p><strong>nihe</strong>: E te whsnau keite pai-he takaro tenei.</p>
<p><strong>young wife</strong>: No, no wait!</p>
<p><strong>bluebeard</strong>: I shall not wait. Bare your neck.</p>
<p><strong>nihe</strong>: Hoki rnai! Hoki rnai!</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I have been waiting. You are very late.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I don’t want you to play. I just want you to
sit.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, not two keys.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Two keys then!</p>

right he can’t play a thing?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Do what you like. Play what you like.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I want to lie together without clothes on.
How many would that be?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Yes, ten keys.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Never behave like that, never any where.
You are greatly shamed and you have shamed those trunks.</p>
<p><strong>maori women</strong>: What o’clock say Mr Stewart? -Ge
Tupeka? -Time for puff puff.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I know why Mr. Baines can’t play the
piano.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You’ve missed this bit.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She never gives him a turn.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: And when is the next lesson?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I am giving the piano back to you. I’ve had
enough. The arrangement is making you a whore and me wretched. I want
you to care for me, but you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: George, can I use this comb?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: It’s yours, leave, go on go!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Stop right there’. This isn’t yours what
are you doing with the piano?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: He’s given it to us.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Hah, you’re very cunning Ada, but I’ve seen
through you, I’m not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: George sick, he don’t wanna see nobody. You
got Tupeka for the Hira?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I don’t think you should have given up the
piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on
to sheets and…</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: I don’t want to learn.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You don’t want to learn.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: And what does this do to our bargain? I
cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, no payment. I have given it back. I
don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well, I doubt I want it very much
myself.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: It was more to your wife that I gave it.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Well, thank you, I expect she will
appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: You make BIG mistake George. In first place
you should swap land for wife. Now look, she gone, you no land, no music
box, you got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Is it all right? Aren’t you going to play
something?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: What will I play?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Play a gig.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Do I know any gigs?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Play a song then</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Why won’t she play it? We have it back, and
she just wanders off!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Keep playing!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Why? Why can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: I shan’t practise and I DON’T CARE!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Where’s your mother? Where has she
gone?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: To HELL!</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: So what brings you here? Did you leave
something? I have not found anything.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Ada, I am unhappy because I want you,
because my mind has seized on you and thinks of nothing else. This is
how I suffer, I am sick with longing. I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. If you
do not want me, if you have come with no feeling for me, then go!</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: What? What? whisper….</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Now you are going I am miserable, why is
that? catches her hand and draws her Ada I need to know, what will you
do? Will you come again?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Wait! I don’t know what you’re thinking.
Does this mean something to you? Hey? I already miss you. Ada, do you
love me?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Stay still! It’s the very worst knots.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mama STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Stop it I feel sick!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mumma! Mumma! They are playing your
piano!</p>

I don’t like it and nor does Papa. Mama, we can play cards together.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She is asleep, look.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: You are letting the clothes float off… They
are floating off.</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: Mama! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: One, two, three One, two, three</p>

cave.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: Yes, like a cave.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Alisdair, is it because of our play?
Have the natives aggressed you?</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: … you are quite trapped.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: We have just come from George Banes’ and
they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in
too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but
without a shred of manners.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: … without a shred of manners.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: He is quite altered, as if they had been
trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he
will be gone.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Baines is packing up?</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is
leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection
for him … we have had some tears</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: STOP IT! STOP!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: If you leave soon, yes, I am sure of
it.</p>
<p><strong>aunt morag</strong>: You know I am thinking of the piano. She
does not play the piano as we do Nessie.</p>
<p><strong>nessie</strong>: Ohhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>mary/heni</strong>: A pid-geon Auntie.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I’ve been hoping you would come.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: I want to touch you Why can’t I touch you?
Do you like me?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: This is going to be Adam’s tree and then I’m
going to make a serpent to live here, with a very long tongue. .</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: We must both get on. I have decided to
trust you to stay here. You will not see Baines?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: We’re not supposed to visit him’.</p>

thousand men etc.</p>

that face in my head hating it. But now I am here seeing it … it’s
nothing, you blink, you have your mark, you look at me through your
eyes, yes. you are even scared of me</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Look at you!</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Has Ada ever spoken to you?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: You mean in signs?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: No, words. You have never heard words?</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, not words.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Never thought you heard words?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: She has spoken to me. I heard her voice.
There was no sound, but I beard it here his forehead with a palm of his
. Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make
the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear
as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: Spoken words?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: No, but her words are in my head. I know
what you think, that it’s a trick, that I’m making it up. No, the words
I heard, were her words.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: She said, “I have to go, let me go, let
Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my
will, of what it might do it is so strange and strong”.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: You punished her wrongly, it was me, my
fault.</p>
<p><strong>stewart</strong>: Understand me. I am here for her, for her I
wonder that I don’t wake, that I am not asleep to be here talking with
you. I love her. But what is the use? She doesn’t care for me. I wish
her gone. I wish you gone. I want to wake and find it was a dream, that
is what I want. I want to believe I am not this man. I want my self
back; the one I know.</p>
<p><strong>hira</strong>: I worry for you.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: No, I love her, we will be a family. I have
her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.</p>

<p><strong>flora</strong>: I can’t</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>flora</strong>: She says, throw the piano overboard.</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: It’s quite safe, they are managing…</p>
<p><strong>baines</strong>: What?</p>

<p><strong>baines</strong>: All right. sit down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: What a death! What a chance! What a surprise!
My will has chosen life!? Still it has had me spooked and many others
besides!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I teach piano now in Nelson. George has
fashioned me a metal finger tip, I am quite the town freak which
satisfies! I am learning to speak. My sound is still so bad I am
ashamed. I practice only when I am alone and it is dark.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: At night! I think of my piano in its ocean
grave, and sometimes of myself floating above it. Down there everything
is so still and silent that it lulls me to sleep. It is a weird lullaby
and so it is; it is mine.</p>
