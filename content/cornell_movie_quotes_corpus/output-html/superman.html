<p><strong>superman the movie</strong>: Shooting script</p>
<p><strong>jor-el’s voice {v.o.)</strong>: This is no fantasy. No
careless product of a wild imagination. We are not dealing here with
idle supposition …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: … no, gentlemen. The indictment I have
brought you this day, the specific charges listed therein against these
individuals, their acts of treason and ultimate aim of sedition . . .
These are matters of undeniable fact!</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: I ask you now to pronounce your judgement on
those accused…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el’s voice</strong>: On this mindless aberration whose
only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el’s voice</strong>: On the woman, URSA, whose
perversions and unreasoning hatred of men have finally threatened even
the male children on our planet….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el’s voice</strong>: And finally on General Zod - Once
trusted by this Council, charged with maintaining the defenses of the
planet Krypton itself - the chief architect of this intended revolution,
the author of this insidious plot to establish a new order among Us -
with himself as absolute ruler.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You have listened to the evidence. The
decision of the Council will now be heard.</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>second elder</strong>: Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Do you have anything to say before the
decision of the Council is pronounced?</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El. It has
therefore now become your decision. You alone will condemn us if you
wish. And you alone will be held responsible by me. Join us. You have
been known to disagree with the Council before. Yours could become an
important voice in the New Order - second only to my own. I offer you a
chance for greatness, Jor-El. Take it. Join us.</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: One day you will bow down before me, Jor-El</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: I swear it! No matter that it takes an
eternity! You will bow down before me…</p>
<p><strong>zod</strong>: …Both you, and then one day, your heirs!</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: An unpleasant duty has been masterfully
performed, Jor-El. They have received the fate they deserved - isolation
in the Phantom Zone - an eternal living death.</p>
<p><strong>jor el</strong>: A… chance for life, nonetheless. As opposed
to us.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You can’t ignore these facts! It’s suicide!
Worse! Genocide!</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: Jor-El, be warned. The Council has
already evaluated this… outlandish theory of yours.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: My friends, you know me’ to be neither rash
nor impulsive. I am not given to wild, unsupported statements. I tell
you we must evacuate this planet immediately!</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: You are one of Krypton’ s greatest
scientists, Jor-El …</p>
<p><strong>second elder</strong>: But so is Vond-Ah.</p>
<p><strong>vond- ah</strong>: Thank you .. It isn’t that I question your
data. The facts are undeniable.</p>
<p><strong>vond-ah</strong>: It’s your conclusions I find
unsupportable.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: This planet will explode within thirty days!
Sooner perhaps!</p>
<p><strong>vond- ah</strong>: I tell you Krypton is simply shifting its
orbit!</p>
<p><strong>second elder</strong>: Jor-El, be reasonable…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: I have never been otherwise. The madness is
yours!</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: This discussion is terminated! The
decision of the council is final. Any attempt by you to create A Climate
of fear and panic among the populace must be deemed by us an act of …
insurrection.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You would accuse me of insurrection? Has it
now become a crime to cherish life?</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: You. . . would be banished to endless
imprisonment in the Phantom Zone - the eternal void which you yourself
discovered.</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: Will you abide by the Council’s
decision?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: I will remain silent. Neither my wife nor I
will attempt to leave Krypton.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Have you … .finished?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Very nearly.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: It’s the only answer Lara. If he remains
here he as will die as surely as. . . we will.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: But why earth, Jor-El. They’re primitives.
Thousands of years behind us.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: He will need that advantage to survive.
Their atmosphere will sustain him …</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: He win defy their gravity …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: He will look like one of them.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: But he won’t be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: His dense molecular structure will make him
strong …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Fast. Virtually invulnerable …</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Isolated. Alone …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: He will not be alone. He will never… be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>military officer</strong>: The energy input to Jor-El’s
quarters is now in excess. Our Data indicates the loss is due to a
mis-use of energy.</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: Investigate.</p>
<p><strong>second elder</strong>: And if the Data proves correct?</p>
<p><strong>first elder</strong>: He knew the penalty he faced. Even as a
member of this Council. The law will be upheld.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You will travel far, my little Kal-El. But I
will never leave you. Even in the face of my death the richness of my
life shall be yours. All that I have learned, everything I feel, all of
this and more I have bequeathed to you my son. You shall carry me inside
you all your days. You will make my strength your own, see my life
through your eyes, as your .life will be seen through mine. The son
becomes the father the father becomes the son. This is all that I can
send with you , Kal-El. And not near so rich a gift as that your mother
sends along. Her … love.</p>
<p><strong>villans</strong>: Take us with you …</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Early concepts of matter appear in ancient
Creek philosophy. In the fifth century Demoocritus defined a small unit
as an atom, then thought to be indivisible…</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Index 19, Sonnet 101: “0 truant muse, what
shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy’d? …</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: …which Einstein called his Theory of
Relativity, mistakenly held to be correct until the year …</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What in the…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: If a man didn’t know better, he’d think
Detroit made those things to blowout on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Great God Almighty! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Careful, Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What in the Sam Hill</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s a … baby.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well - better change that tire if we’re
gonna get hone and see about contactin’ that boy’s proper kin.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: He hasn’t got any - not for sure. Not around
here anyways. You saw that magic contraption he came in, same as me.</p>
<p><strong>jonath.an</strong>: I did. But I ain’t gettin’ hauled off to
no booby hatch by tellin’ other people I did - and neither is you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You take things easy now, Jonathan. You mind
what Doc Frye said about that heart of’ yours…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: All these years, happy as we’ve been, how I
prayed and prayed the Good Lord would see fit to give us a child.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Martha, there is something downright
strange about that boy. Where he come from, what he just did back there.
Now surely you don’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No one must ever know.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But folks’ll ask questions . . .</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: We’ll say he’s child to my cousin in North
Dakota, and just now orphaned. Jonathan, he’s a baby… Poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well… Maybe we could give it a try for the
time bein’. I’d better hitch the rig and come back to Get that … that
thing he was settin’ in. What do you make of that thing? Martha’? Martha
Kent, you listenin’ to me?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I was thinkin’ what to call him. I was
thinkin’ I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The church
sexton?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Who?- Clark? I never cared two hoots for
that fella.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You don’t have to bother with those, Susie.
I’ll take them in for you with the other equipment.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Why, thank you, Clark. You know something,
Clark? I think you’re just about the nicest boy in the whole school.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well … ah … ah … it’s sort of my job as team
manager, anyway, and…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: No, I mean it. I really do. Listen. A whole
bunch of us are going over to Mary Ellen’ s and play some records. Would
you like to come?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, gee… I’d…why, yes, Susie, I’d like that
very…</p>
<p><strong>football player</strong>: Kent won’t be able to make it.</p>
<p><strong>football player</strong>: Kent’s still got a lot of work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What do you mean? I’ve stacked all the…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m … sorry, Susie. I guess I’d better clean
it up.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Golly! I saw a boy out there, running fast as
the train! Faster, even!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Lois Lane, you do have a writer’s gift for
invention. I’ll say that for you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Read your book, dear.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Clark ….?</p>
<p><strong>football player</strong>: How the hell did you…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I ran.</p>
<p><strong>football player</strong>: Told you he was a weirdo. Let’s get
out of here…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s voice</strong>: Been showin’ off a bit, have you,
son?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I don’t mean…to show off, Dad. It’s just
that…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You got all these amazin’ things you can
do and sometimes you think you’ll go bust if you don’t let other people
know ..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I could score a touchdown every time I had
the ball. Every time, Dad. Is it showing off for a person to do what
he’s capable of? Is a bird Showing off when it flies? I’m sorry, Dad. I
know I made a promise, but I just don’t think I can handle it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Look, son. You’ve been nothin’ but a
blessing to your mother and me. In the beginning - when you first came
-we thought they’d take you away from us if people found out about. . .
the things you could do. But a man thinks different as he gets older,
’thinks… better. Wiser. Starts to see things clear. And I know now that
as sure as we’re gonna see the moon tonight there’s a reason why you’re
here. Don’t ask me what reason, don’t ask me whose reason. But whoever,
and whatever, there’s one thing I do know… It ain’t to score
touchdowns.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Now why don’t you see if you can finish up
your chores before I finish up all that apple pie I smell comin’ from
your mother’s kitchen window….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Dad! . .</p>
<p><strong>martha’s voice</strong>: Jonathan…?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All those things I can do, all those powers…
and I still couldn’t save him.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Clark? Are you going to sleep all day? I’ve
got….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I… have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I… knew this time would come. I knew it from
the day I found you. .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ll bring in the crop before I leave. I…
talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday. He’ll be happy to help out from now
on.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: He’s a good man, Ben is. Your father always
said so.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I know, son. I know….</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I made you… …some sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you … know where you’re headed?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: North.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Remember us. Always remember us.</p>
<p><strong>truck drivers</strong>: Get in Kid! Quick, before you freeze
to death!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m okay, thanks. It was nice of you to stop,
though.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell. You wanna make a popsicle
outa yourself, none of my business….</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: My son, you do not remember me. I am Jor-El.
I am … your father. By now you will have reached your eighteenth year of
time as it is measured on earth. By that same reckoning I will have been
dead for many thousands of your years. The knowledge that I have of,
matters physical and historic I have given to you fully on your voyage
to your new home. These are important matters, to be, sure, but still
matters of mere fact. There are questions to be asked and it is time for
you to do so. Here in this Fortress of Solitude we shall try to find the
answers together. How does a Good man live? What is virtue’? When does a
man’s obligation to those around him exceed his obligation to himself’?
These are not simple questions - even on Krypton there is no precise
science which provides us with the answers. I can only tell you what I
myself believe. To this end, I have tried to anticipate your questions,
and in -the order of their importance to you. Speak.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Who . . . am I?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Your name is Kal-El. You are the only
survivor of the planet Krypton. Even though you have been raised as a
human being, you are not one of them. You have great powers, only some
of which you have, as yet, discovered …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Your mother, Lara, has sent along three
Blankets of red, yellow, and blue. United in United in a single garment,
their</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You are superior to others. You can only
become inferior by setting yourself above them. Lead by inspiration. Let
your actions and ideals become a touchstone against which mankind may
learn how to serve the common good. While it is forbidden for you to
interfere with human history itself, your leadership can stir others to
their own capacity for moral betterment …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: The virtuous spirit has no need for thanks
or approval. Only the certain conviction that what has been done is
right. Develop such conviction in yourself, Kal-El. The human heart on
your planet is still subject to small jealousies, lies, and monstrous
deceptions. Resist these temptations as you inevitably find them - and
your ethical power will then properly outweigh your physical advantage
over others…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Your education nears a kind of completion
now, Kal-El, although no limit to understanding or knowledge has ever
truly existed. Over the years you have asked important questions and I
think together we have almost always found the answer to them. Now it is
time for you to return to the world which I have chosen for you. When
new questions arise, come back to me and I will try to be of help …</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover
where your strength and power are needed - but always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage. Your being is both separate and your
own , but I have caused your earthly presence and must share
responsibility for your actions. They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this
reason above all - their capacity for good - I have sent them you. My
only son.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, my god, I couldn’t help…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have
crossed against the light.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How do you spell “massacre?”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s voice</strong>: R-E.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’re you writing. Lois?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: An Ode to Spring. One or two “T’s” in
bloodletting?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: “And the people on the street, the little man
who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the
stoop, the kids playing stickball in the alley - none of them will ever
forget that night of senseless blood-letting which turned a friendly
block party into a cruel and unspeakable massacre.”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Boy! How come you get all the great stories,
Lois?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A good reporter doesn’t get the great stories,
Jimmy. A good reporter makes them great.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, wow…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Here’s the story on that East 19th Street
murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to
me.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: So why should today be different… Clark Kent,
say hello to Lois Lane.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hello, Lois …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hi there…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Believe me, Chief, it’s got everything. Sex.,
violence, the ethnic angle…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: So does a lady wrestler with a foreign
accent. Here, Kent. Open this, will you?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Chief, this could be the basis for a whole
series of articles - “Making sense of senseless killings”, you know? We
get psychiatrists …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: …sociologists, interviews with the
families…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois, you’re pushing a pile of rinky-dink
tabloid crap. The Daily Planet has a tradition to …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t shake it up on
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Of course you didn’t, Lois. Why would anyone
want a total stranger look like a fool?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois, take Kent out there and introduce him
around. He’s coming to work for the paper. I’m putting him on the city
beat.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: My … beat?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: The competition’ll do wonders for you.
Listen. Not only does this guy show proper respect for his
editor-in-chief … not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style,
but I swear to you that after forty years in the business he is the
fastest typist I have ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m sure I can learn a lot from you, Lois
…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Your bookie?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Don’t tell me. He sends a check every week to
his dear grey-haired old mother.</p>
<p><strong>ci.ark</strong>: Actually, she’s silver-haired.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Are there any more at home like you7</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well, Clark? So how did you enjoy your first
day on the job?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Frankly the hours were somewhat longer than I
expected, Lois, but then… meeting you and Jimmy and Mr. White - on the
whole I think it’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Swell. You know, Clark, there are very few
people left in the world these days who sound comfortable saying that
word … “swell”.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Really? It just sort of comes naturally to
me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: All right. Freeze. The both of you.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Get in here.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Better do as he says, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Listen, mister. I realize times are tough for
some these days, but …. This isn’t the answer. You can’t solve society’s
problems with a gun.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: You know something, buddy? You’re . right
I’m turning over a new leaf.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Right after I rip off this lady’s purse. Now
hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark. . . oh, Clark . . . are you. . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Wow … I guess I must have fainted or
something …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Swell.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Really, Lois. Supposing that man had shot
you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, a
hairbrush, and a lipstick? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You just described the exact contents of my
purse.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Wild guess.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: That’s him, all right. Lex Luthor’s
right-hand man. Let’s get him.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Wait. Maybe he’ll lead us to the man
himself.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Lex Luthor…</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: You got it, Charlie. We both make
Captain by midnight.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Call for a back-up. I’m going after him.
I’ll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Lower level, Charlie. I’m right on his
ass…</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Track 22, Charlie…</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Make it Track 23, Charlie. I see how he
does it…</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: It’s a miracle that brain can
generate enough power to keep his legs moving….</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s sick, Lex. Really.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Sick. Here we sit, Miss Teschmacher, mere
days away from executing The Crime of the Century, and how do you choose
to congratulate the greatest criminal mind or our age? Do you call me
brilliant? A bit obvious, that, I grant you. Charismatic, then?
Fiendishly gifted?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Try twisted.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m back, Mr. Luthor…..</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You were followed again, Otis…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Yes. In spite of those cat-like
reflexes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: See if you can just explain to</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: me one thing. Why do millions of people have to
die for this…Crime of the Century? Tell me that, Lex. Why do they all
have to die?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Why. Why does the phone always ring when
you’re sitting in the tub? Why do restaurants call animal intestines
sweetbreads? Why would the most brilliantly diabolical leader of all
time surround himself with total incompetents? Why, in fact, does the
chicken cross the road?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: To get to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m wrong again, aren’t I, Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No, Otis. As a matter of fact, I stuck that
last one in especially for you. Is that the newspaper I asked you to get
me?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then why am I not reading it?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Because I… haven’t given it to you,
Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: At last it’s official! Thanks to the
generous help of our own government, we are finally going to realize the
greatest real swindle in history!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You and your real estate. Why does it mean so
much to you? All the time, “land, land, land.”</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: When I was a mere prodigy, Miss Teschmacher,
having passed through vandalism with flying colours at the age of six,
my father said to me: “Son, stocks will rise and fall. . . . Utilities
and transportation systems may even collapse, and people are no damn
good - but they’ll always need land, and for that they’ll pay, through
the nose. Remember that,” my father said. “Land.”</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: “Land!”</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Then your father must have been sick too.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Arnold “Buster” Luthor. The most inept check
forger of his day. A pity he didn’t see how, from such humble
beginnings, I created an empire.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: An empire? This?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Tell me, Miss Teschmacher. How many other
girls are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It isn’t a Park Avenue address, really. Two
hundred feet below.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do you know what they’re all paying per
square foot up there? For a few miserable rooms of a common elevator?
What more could anyone ask for?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sunlight. Something that overlooks a
window.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Otis, you want something. What can I throw
at you?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: The…ah…paper, if you’re through with it,
sir…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: A newspaper? Otis? You want to read the
newspaper? Is there really life after death? Is water finally running
uphill ?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I thought maybe…the funnies. . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Here. Don’t forget to flush this time.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You know something, Lex? You’re perverted.
You’re the most cruel and vicious human being I know…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’d cut a baby’s throat with its own diaper
pin. Steal the wafer from a nun’s handbag….</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What’s wrong with me, anyway? Why do I love you
so much?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Life is never boring with me. Admit it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Never, Lex. You’re the absolute pits.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Olsen, take this Loch Ness update down to
composing - tell them to use it as fill unless something comes in on
that jewel robbery.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Right, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: And don’t call me Chief.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Harry? That’s it. Put ’er to bed.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois, about that sex maniac profile…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I know. Nine to five it’s a Pulitzer
Prize.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I was going to say there’s only one p in
rapist. Nice job on the Teamster scandal, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Thanks , Mr. White .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What…? Oh, goodnight, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Actually, Lois, I… ah, well…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Would you, ah…be interested in a little
dinner tonight?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Sorry, Clark. I’m booked.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Air Force One is landing at the airport
tonight and this kid’s going to be there to make sure you-know-who
answers a few questions he’d rather duck.</p>
<p><strong>cla.rk</strong>: Don’t you ever let up?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: For what? Oh, I’ve seen how the other half
lives. My sister, for instance. . . three kids, two cats, one
mortgage….I’d go bananas after a week.. I already am bananas, right?
That’s what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No. I’m just thinking that you smoke too
much, if you don’t mind my saying so. Lois, you should see what the
inside of your lungs look like.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I appreciate the advice, okay? I’ve got a
story to do.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Can I take you to the airport?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Not unless you can fly. . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Good night, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Going Down?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, my god, I couldn’t help…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t notice the light.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: Say, Jim! That is a bad outfit…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: Wait a minute, Jim! Who’s your tailor, baby?
Who cuts your threads?</p>
<p><strong>first voice</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: It’s a bird!</p>
<p><strong>fourth voice</strong>: Goddamned if I know, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Easy now, Miss. I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’ve got me? Who’s got you?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I hope this little incident doesn’t put
you off flying, Miss. Statistically it’s still the safest way to
travel.</p>
<p><strong>lois,</strong>: I. . .</p>
<p><strong>tv cameraman</strong>: There he is !</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hi there. Something wrong with the
elevator?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: They say confession is Good for the soul,
Officer. I’d listen to this man.</p>
<p><strong>burglar</strong>: What the hell. It’s only a dream,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>first hood</strong>: Holy sh….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Bad vibrations?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Sergeant, I swear! Flying! With a big red
cape! And bright red boots as well! Then, quick as a wink - he was gone!
Flew up in the air again, he did. Like a big blue bird.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Like a big blue bird….with bright red
boots.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Why don’t you take the rest of the night
off now, Mooney. Go back to Murphy’s bar and finish what you plainly
started. I’ll be off myself in a bit and join ya there…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Off we go, then, Mooney. The first
bottle’s on me….</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Frisky! Oh, Frisky, please come
down….</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Gee, thanks Mister. You naughty thing.
. .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Don’t be too hard on Frisky. We all get a
little scared of heights now and then.</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: Haven’t I told you to stop telling
lies?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: What happened? We get our engine back?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Fly.. Don’t look. We… got something. . .
Trust me. Just … fly.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hey! It’s me! Remember? Lois Lane! The girl
from the roof?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey, Lois. You know that guy?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, nothing …intimate.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You…enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I don’t know what to say. I guess I just
got…carried away.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: I anticipated this, my son. I…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You couldn’t have! You couldn’t have
Imagined…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: How good it felt!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: How good it felt…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: You are revealed to the world. Very well. So
be it. But still you must keep your secret identity.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: The reasons are two: First, even you cannot
serve humanity twenty-eight hours a day…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Your
help would be called for endlessly, even for those tasks which human
beings could solve for themselves. It is their habit to abuse their
resources in such a way.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: And secondly?</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Second: Your enemies will discover their
only way to hurt you - by hurting the people you care for.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thank you, Father…</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: Lastly- do not punish yourself for your
feelings of vanity. Simply learn to control them. It is an affliction
common to all, even here on Krypton… Our destruction could have been
avoided but for the vanity of some who considered us indestructible.
Were it not for vanity…why…at this very moment… I could embrace you in
my arms …my son…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Good evening. And what sort of night has
it been so far? A night that has seen what many believe to be the most
extraordinary phenomenon of our times …</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Our newsfilm confirm eyewitness’s
reports of a caped figure, resembling a man, who appeared flying in the
sky over Metropolis. Yes, I said flying . . .</p>
<p><strong>crowd member</strong>: That’ll be the day, huh?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You said it.</p>
<p><strong>newscater</strong>: White House comments are guarded at
present, although the F. B. I . is said to be investigating the matter.
As further accounts pour in, speculation has arisen that this whole
thing may be some sort of fantastic hoax …</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The Mayor of Chicago commented that it
all seemed too be a publicity stunt designed to draw attention to
Metropolis…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: ….a city that has been having its share
of financial problems of late.</p>
<p>**ne*: …His question is everybody’s: True or false? Miracle or
fraud?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Turn it off…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The answer is up to you. Man or
myth?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: What’s a myth?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Something unreal….something…. not quite
human. Something like you, Otis</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m a myth….</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So what’s the story, Lex? You think this guy’s
the genuine article?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: If he is - he’s from another world…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Because if any human being could have
perpetrated such a fantastic hoax, it would have been for me and I would
have thought of it by now.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It all fits somehow His coming here to
Metropolis - and at this particular time. There’s a kind of … cruel
justice about it. I mean, to commit the Crime of the Century, a man
would just naturally have to face - the Challenge of the Century.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Maybe he’ll leave you alone, Lex. Maybe he’s
just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Just . . . passing through, Miss
Teschmacher? Not on your life…something I would gladly sacrifice by the
way - for the one chance to destroy everything he represents. Oh, and
Otis…</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Yes, Mr. Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Next time, put the robe on after I get out
of the pool.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I know that, Otis.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It wasn’t a trick!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon
and it wasn’t a trick. It was probably done with wires. They must have
rigged him up like Peter Pan.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: There weren’t any wires. I looked.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mirrors, then.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: He grabbed me! He held me! How could that be
done with mirrors?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I don’t know, Lois, but I do know a fraud
when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’re just jealous.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Jealous! Of what?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Of this…Superman.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Super…man. Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m going to make some coffee. Want some?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You know something? I’ve only said three words
to the man…but for the first time in a long time - I think I’m kind
of…stuck on someone.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Just…three little words, as they say. “Help”
and “Thank you.” Not exactly the basis for a meaningful relationship, is
it? I mean, for all I know, he’s got a wife and kids on some other
planet. But somehow I just can’t stop…fantasizing about him, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: So I called a guy who’s married to this girl I
went to college with. He’s a shrink. I made an appointment and went to
see him…</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s coice</strong>: …tape recording left at station
W.M.E.T. Police chief James Vitucci listened to it immediately, put the
police on emergency alert, and warned citizens to remain in their homes
in he downtown area. Here is the recording:</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: This is the voice of Lex Luthor. I
have a challenge for this…unidentified flying object. This bogus blue
baffoon. There is an abandoned warehouse at the corner of Fifth and
Main…</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Somewhere inside that warehouse is a
pellet filled with a propane lithium compound. At precisely twelve noon
it will drop into a beaker of acid.</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Within a matter of seconds a poison
gas will be released that will annihilate everyone within a forty block
radius…</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: I would remind the tin-plated
minions of law that this warehouse has been fitted with anti-personnel
devices, which will render any police action totally ineffective…</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Is this cape-flapping freak all that
he seems or are we merely victims of mass hysteria? Thousands of
innocent lives hang in the balance. I make this gesture as a public
service, by the way - and without thanks. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: …and then he said, “maybe the guy’s a father
figure.” So I said, “look. My Pop’s a terrific guy, but he doesn’t go
flying around town in a red cape…”</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark…Clark? Nuts. Now I’ve gone and hurt his
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Look at that overgrown Boy Scout, Miss
Teschmacher, Tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Cuteness. Dimples.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Did I miss something, Lex?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Confidence</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: This guy handles himself pretty good,
Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: All right, all right, so he’s tough! We knew
that. So you like dimples, eh, Miss Teschmacher? I’ll give him
dimples………</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Dimples. Would you settle for acne?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Don’t worry, don’t worry, we’ll find his
weakness…..</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Hey. Maybe he’s got a glass jaw. Then, on the
other hand……</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: But how can it be? That creep should have
melted in there!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He doesn’t even look soft around the edges,
Lex.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What’s the temperature?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Fifty below and falling.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: When it gets to a hundred - stabilize
it.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: The guy probably never owned a sweater in his
life…</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Don’t tell me he’s suddenly got a problem….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Ssshhh…….</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Now look! We’ re sitting on top of the story
of the century here! Our only problem is how to get it - exclusively! I
want the name Superman and the Daily Planet to go together like bacon
and eggs!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, I shouldn’t think he’d lend himself to
any cheap promotion schemes….</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Who’s talking cheap? I’ll make him a goddamn
partner if I have to! I want the inside dope on the real Superman! Who
is he? Where’s he from? What’s his favorite ball team? And I’ll tell you
one thing, boys and girls -whichever one of you Gets it out of him will
have the single most important interview since Moses talked to Cod .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: There must be a way. Maybe if I hung myself,
off another building. . . . .lay down on some train tracks, .or
something….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: A, Lois….about tonight….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mmm? What about tonight, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Our date. Well, our. . . .dinner.. Don’t you
remember?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Sorry, Clark…I must have forgot.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee. I planned on it all week…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: All right, Clark. I’ll go out with you. Might
as well get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’re wonderful, Lois. Where would you like
to go?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… How about the Gold Room at
the Park Towers?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The Gold Room? But that’s the most expensive
place in town.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The Gold Room? Golly Mr. Kent, are you really
going to take Miss Lane to the Gold Room.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh. I don’t know, Jimmy. Maybe… if she’s a …
good girl, that is…</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And if I’m not a good girl… Let’s let Jimmy
take the pictures: okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Boy. What do you suppose she meant by that,
Mr. Kent?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Not too bad, kid. As a matter of fact - just
this side of sensational. Hmm. Clark is late….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Probably out in the hall getting up enough
nerve to knock.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You know something, Lois? You’re too hard on
Clark sometimes. He’s a decent kind of guy and he has got this terrific
crush on you…. I mean it’s not his fault he’ll never be a ……</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: ….Superman.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Good evening. Miss Lane. . . . I’m sorry.
Were you just about to go out?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Ah. . . . .no. . . .no! Whyever would you. . .
Oh. This old thing….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s no trouble for me to come back later.
I mean I don’t have to park or anything.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You just stay right where you are! Please!
Don’t move! Or move, if you want, but don’t fly away.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sorry to just…drop in on you like this,
Miss Lane, hut I realize there must be many questions about me the world
would like the answers to. . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: So it’s become important for me to have
very close relations with the press.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You really shouldn’t smoke, you know.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Don’t tell me. Lung cancer, right?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Not yet, thank goodness.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Let’s…ah…start with your vital statistics,
okay? Age?</p>
<p><strong>superman.</strong>: Thirty.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Height?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Six-four</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Weight?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: One ninety-five.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And I take it the rest or your bodily
functions are what we’d consider…normal?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well - putting it delicately - do you eat?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: When I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Would you like a cookie?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Macaroons.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A glass of wine?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I never drink when I fly.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Is it true you can see through anything?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And you’re totally impervious to pain?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What Color underwear am I wearing?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Pink.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Ah….do you have a first name?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You mean like Ralph, or something?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I mean what’s your background? Where do you
hail from? 220 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I was born on a planet in the Xeno Galaxy.
A place called Krypton.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Uh-huh. And do you…. Like pink?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I like pink very much, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Look. Just why are you in the in first place?
I mean , why are you here? There must be a reason. SUPERMAN I’m here to
fight for truth justice, and the American way.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’ll wind up fighting almost every elected
official in this country.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sure you don’t really mean that,
Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Listen. With all these strange powers of
yours…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You find them ……strange?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Let’s just say your average Joe can’t deliver
an airmail letter without putting a stamp on it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I wouldn’t do that. It’s against the
law.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I don’t believe this…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I never lie.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Ah….just how fast do you fly, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I don’t know really. I’ve never actually
timed myself. Let’s find together, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And just how would you propose we do that?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Take a ride with me. Now Would you like
to?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: : A ride? You mean would I like to fly?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Well. I’ll be handling the flying of
course.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: This is utterly fantastic! If only Clark could
see me now….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Clark? Is he your….boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark? Oh, he’s sort of….nothing at all,
really. Dull, mild-mannered, you know the type.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sure he’s actually very nice.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: To get a coat. Isn’t it kind of cold up
there?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You’ll be warm enough. I’ll wrap you in my
cape.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark said you were only rigged with wires.
Like Peter Pan.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Peter Pan flew with children, Lois. In a
fairy tale.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I figure it took about ninety seconds. How
about you?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Are you feeling all right?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mmm? Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Well, So long, then….</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I….wonderful…..you….</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, for goodness sake. Didn’t you hear me
knock?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Hi…..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois, you’re not…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well I should hope not. Let’s push off then,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Okay…..</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know something, Lois? I’ll admit I was
nervous at first, about but then, well, darn it - I decided I was going
to show you the time of your life.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s Clark, nice…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now then … given the location of the galaxy
he mentions . . . And its proximity to our own solar system ..amazing…
Too good to be true! …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You said it … six-four, blue eyes, doesn’t
drink, tells the truth …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Some people can read War and Peace and come
away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Others can read the
ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secret of the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I read the article, Lex.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Onward to the letter N. Otis. Let’s
roll!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Was that “M,” Mr. . Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: As in “moron”? No, Otis, N, as in nitwit,
nincompoop, Neanderthal…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now then. According to that interview the
planet Krypton blew up on May 23, 1948. ” The rocket carrying the
revolting little freak took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally
descriptive of both of’ us, Otis? It represents your weight - and my
I.Q. Think, people, think! Deductive reasoning, that’s the name of the
game!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Since .fragments of Krypton must have been
shot out into space by the explosion, it’s reasonable to assume some of
the debris would have landed here on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You mean meteorites?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Jawohl.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Et … voila!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know I’m going to get rapped in the mouth for
saying this, but - so what?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: So -what? You mean to us it’s just a
meteorite? Fair enough. . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: But because of its high level of specific
radioactivity - to someone from the planet Krypton - this substance
would be lethal!</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: You mean bullets and .fire can’t hurt him, but
this kind of rock</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Will kill him!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: At times like these you must experience a
certain shudder of ecstasy just being in the same room with me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Not like the kind of shudder you’re going to
feel when you try and lay that rock on him. He can spot you coming miles
away with those super-peepers of his.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Lord, you gave them eyes, but they see not!
And neither can Superman - through lead. Four doors, Miss Teschmacher,
lead doors, and he had to rip them all down to find that poisoned
pellet. This bilious bluebird has two Achilles’ heels!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You mean lead can hide things from him…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And the Kryptonite - will destroy him! Any
more Questions?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I wonder what they’re wearing in Addis
Ababa.</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Shut it down! Shut it down!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: Too late! Pipe’s jumped the bit! Can’t
control it…!</p>
<p><strong>worker #3</strong>: Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do you 1ive.1n England, Otis?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I don’ t think so, Mr. Luthor . . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then why are you driving on the left!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now, Otis! Go!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Ten second, Miss Teschmacher . . .</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Did you ever try to run in high heels? You
probably did.</p>
<p><strong>eve’svoice</strong>: Thanks a lot…fine now…Hey! What did You
have for lunch, Ace!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: That was fast. Damnit. . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Fast? When a woman’s life is at stake?</p>
<p><strong>eve’s voice</strong>: And that’s about all I got left to
lose, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I did it, Mr. Luthor! Just like you told me
to!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s not that I don’t trust you, Otis . . .
Yes, it is. Tell me what you did.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I reset the first vector heading to 38, the
second one to 67, and the third one to 117 .</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And the fourth one ?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: What fourth one?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The third to 117?</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: See? I wrote it down …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The third one goes to 11, Otis. And the
fourth one to 7.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Gee. 1 guess my arm wasn’t long enough to make
a big space.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Would you like to see an arm long enough to
make a big space, Otis? Do you want to see an arm long enough to Make a
big space? 5/5/77 TM</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: … here at Danforth Proving
Grounds for the launching of two XK1O1 rockets, the very latest weapon
in our arsenal of defense …</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice.</strong>: It is claimed that the XK101 can
hit any target Completely undetected since it flies well below all radar
systems yet designed …</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey, Clark. Chief wants to see you …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Thanks, Eddie</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: The ultra-modern, built-in
sensory devices can detect any object in its path and automatic1y avoid
it, either going over, under, or around…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Come in, Kent.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hi, Mr. White . . . Is Lois is around
today?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: She’s out west looking into a land fraud
deal. I sent young Olsen with her on his first photo assignment. Some
unidentified joker’s been buying up thousands of acres of worthless
desert at incredible prices.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hmm. Doesn’t seem to make sense . . .</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: The world doesn’t make sense, Kent. You
should know that by now. Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa. People
break into a museum in the dead of night - kill two guards - and what do
they take? Some worthless hunk of meteorite . How do you figure it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ve never been able to understand violence
in any form, Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I know that, Kent. That’s part of the reason
I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’ve been in the news business man and boy
for forty years. I got where I am with guts, compassion, and elbow
grease - but most of all with one thing you sadly lack, my boy -
aggression. Take charge, Kent: Confidence, that’s the ticket! Why, when
was . .</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: … get Lois to introduce you to Superman.
Start to hang out with the guy. Give me the man-to-man angle . . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor’5 voice</strong>: This is Lex Luthor. Only one thing
alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency, Superman, and
that’s you.</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: In approximately five minutes a
poisoned gas pellet containing a propane lithium compound will be
released through thousands of air ducts in this city . . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Effectively annihilating half the
population of Metropolis.</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: I know it all seems a bit much, but
how else was I going to get to meet you, Superman? I knew you’d never
accept an invitation to tea.</p>
<p><strong>luthor’ s voice</strong>: But a disaster - with people in
danger - people who need help . . .</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: I just knew you couldn’t resist the
chance of sort of … pitch in. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: There’s a strong streak of good in
you, Superman. But then, nobody’s perfect. Almost nobody.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Everybody back, please! Thank you . ..</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Unfortunately I’m not in the book,
but a bright boy like you should be ab1e to find the address …</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: See what I mean? And not a moment
too soon.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Look at that overgrown Boy Scout, Miss
Teschmacher. Tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Cuteness. Dimples.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You like dimples? I’ll give him dimples</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s open…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Come in, Superman. My attorney will be in
touch about the door. Otis, don’t just stand there, take the man’s
cape….</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: I… don’t think he wants me to, Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: All right, Luthor, where’s the gas
pellet?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Somewhere … in the back of my mind,
actually. It’s just a fun little project I’ve been toying with.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Is that how a warped brain like yours gets
its kicks? By planning the death of innocent people?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No. By causing the death of innocent
people.</p>
<p><strong>mis5ile controller #1</strong>: Jesus Christ, they’ve gone
berserk!</p>
<p><strong>controler #2</strong>: I can’t control them! Red Alert! Red
Alert! Get the Pentagon!</p>
<p><strong>cjcs</strong>: That’s impossible! It can’t happen, damnit!…
It…</p>
<p><strong>cjcs</strong>: Get me the President! 234D EXT. COLF COURSE -
DAY</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: Goddamnit! What now!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You see, Superman… I had a dream! …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: In your case it must have been a
nightmare, Luthor. Get on with it!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Right. Well … as you mayor may not know,
Superman, I am, as they say, very heavy into real estate. In order to
make money in that game you have to buy in for a little and sell for a
lot. Right? Right. So. Problem: how to make that property valuable
between the time you buy and the time you sell. Now then…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Otis. This is France.</p>
<p><strong>otis</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And this - is California. The richest, most
populace state in America.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I don’t need a geography lesson from you,
Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Sorry. You do get around, don’t you. Now
then. Where was I? Ah, yes…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you’ve heard
of 1t.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sure. It’s the joining together of two
land masses. The .fault line is unstable and shifting which is why you
get earthquakes in California from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Couldn’t have said it better myself. Now all
this… …west of’ the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the
world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And on the other side… is
just hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be
owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well… call me a fool, but it did occur
to me that if a 500 megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper
stress point….</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Most of California would be destroyed!
Millions of people would be killed! The West Coast as we know it
would…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: …drop into the Sea! Bye-bye California!
Hello new West Coast! My… West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You are a dreamer, Luthor. A sick-Twisted
dreamer. It couldn’t possibly work.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Oh, I’ll admit there were problems.
Adjusting the missile trajectory, finding the precise point of optimum
stress on the Fault…</p>
<p><strong>luthor’s voice</strong>: Which is… right here, by the way… .
Target Zero.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: …no oil, no uranium, no coal, no precious
minerals… hell, no water anymore… Not since the government dammed it all
up..</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: My associate, Mr. Olsen, is taking pictures of
that Dam right now, Chief. But why sell out to some faceless person
you’ve never met? You don” even know his name.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: At the stupid high price he offered for this
worthless piece of desert… I only hope it’s Custer.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Check the viewing room, Otis… Well,
Superman? What do you think? Interesting?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Your theory’s quite impressive, Luthor.
But as for the rest - it’s nothing but a sick fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Fantasy?… History!! It’s happened,
Superman!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Where’s that rocket now?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Passing the Grand Canyon, Lex. Going like a
bat. So’s the other one.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: The other one! There’s two of them?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: That’s right, Superman. Double jeopardy! And
even you can’t fly fast enough to stop both of them! While I, on the
other hand would merely have to press my detonating device and …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Where is it, Luthor! Where’s that
detonator?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You diseased maniac! Did you really think
you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’ll mold this box into your prison bars,
you…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That rock… I can-t… my strength..</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: It’s Kryptonite Superman! A little souvenir
from your home town! You see I’ve spared no expense in making you feel
right at home here!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Away… please… take it…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You were great in your day, Superman. But
When the time came to cash in your chips, Lex Luthor was just naturally
your banker! Mind…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: …over muscle …</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’m afraid I have to leave you now. Nothing
personal, you understand. We all have our faults. It’s just that mine is
in Ca1ifornia.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You don’t . . . even care. . . where the
other missile . . . is headed, do you ..</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: On the contrary. I figured it out instantly.
Hackensack, New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Hurry, Miss Teschmacher . . .</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: But Lex….</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: My… mother lives in Hackensack.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Your mother used to live in Hackensack.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Miss . . . Teschmacher . . . please. . you
can’t . . . stand by. . . and let millions of people . . . innocent
people. . . die . . .</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Maybe . . . If it wasn’t for … my mother. .
.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Please. . . help me to save them . . .
Please . . .</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: If I help you . . . Will you save my mother
first?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: But Lois . . . and Jimmy . . . are . .
.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: My mother comes first, promise me. I know you
wouldn’t break a promise.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Pro. . . promise . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: What …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Why did you kiss me first?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Cause you wouldn’t have let me later.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Thank you, Miss Teschmacher…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You too. I… just can’t get it on for the good
guys, you know?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sorry about the car …</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Forget it, it’s a Hertz.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Superman! I’m up here, Superman! I’m …</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Want a picture on page one of every
newspaper in the world?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Ready…? Now!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s over! You did it, Superman!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Sorry I left you waiting all the way up
here, Lois, but I was kind of busy down there for a while.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, I understand … Your work comes first.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: And there’s one last piece of unfinished
business left… Take care of her, Jimmy. I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Boy. Superman sure seems to care about you,
Miss Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman cares about everyone, Jimmy. …. But
who knows? . . . Maybe one day . . . If he’s lucky . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hello, Warden. I think these men should be
safe here with you until they can get a fair trial.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Thanks, Superman. Take ’em away, boys .
.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: This country is safe again, Superman -
thanks to you.</p>

doctor, the teacher, the clergyman - the cop on the beat . . . We’re all
