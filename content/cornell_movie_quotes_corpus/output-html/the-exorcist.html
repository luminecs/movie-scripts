<p><strong>president</strong>: Could see about a transfer Damien.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I need reassignment Tom, I want out of this
job. It’s wrong, it’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re the best we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Am I really? It’s more than psychiartry and
you know that Tom, some of there problems come down to faith, there
vocation, the meaning of there lives and I can’t cut it anymore. I need
out I’m unfit. I think I’ve lost my faith Tom.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Mom, why do people have to die?</p>

<p><strong>regan</strong>: Why does God let us get tired?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us
back.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you
have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.
Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn’t even call his daughter on
her birthday for christ sake.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Maybe the circuit is busy?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh circuit my ass, he doesn’t give a
shit!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why don’t you let me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No I’ve got it Sharon, it’s all right. Yes.
No, Operator don’t tell me there’s no answer, it’s the Hotel Excelcia in
Rome would you try it again please and let it ring. Hello? Operator
you’ve given me the number four times. What did you do, take an
iliteracey test to get that job for Christ sake. No don’t tell me to be
calm god damn it! I’ve been on this fucking line for twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah? You’re kidding me? I thought I just
went to bed. Uh huh. What are we doing scene sixty one? Okay, just
remind him about that blue belt huh?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: My bed was shaking, I can’t get to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, honey.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: There is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Very sorry, but you see, no rats!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No rats. Thanks a lot that’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: The edima affected her brain, you understand
Dimmy? She don’t let no doctor come near her. She was all the time
screaming, even talking to the radio.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You should have called me the minute it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Listen, regular hospital not going to put up
with her Dimmy, understand? So we give her a shot and bring her here,
till the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her out Dimmy, two or
three months and she’s out good as new.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Miss?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: We want to see Mrs. Karras.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Are you a relative?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Yes I am her brother, he’s the son</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: You know it’s funny. If you wasn’t a priest
you’d be famous psychiatrist now on Park Avenue, your mother she’d be
living in a penthouse instead of here.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: You go in Dimmy. I wait for you outside.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You’ll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed on
the left hand side.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Momma? It’s Dimmy momma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. karras</strong>: Dimmy. Why they did this to me Dimmy?
Why?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Momma, I’m gonna take you outta here
momma.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Momma I’m goona take you home.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Momma, everything’s gonna be alright momma,
I’m gonna take you home!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Couldn’t you have put her some place
else?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Like what? Private hospital? Who got the
money for that Dimmy? You?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: A disorder of the nerves. At least we
think it is. We don’t know yet exactly how it works, but it’s often seen
in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the
temper; her performance in math.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why the math?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: It affects concentration.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a
day.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What is it? A tranquilizer?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: A stimulant.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Stimulant? She’s higher than a kite right
now!</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Her condition isn’t quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The
Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don’t know
how or why, frankly. Your daughter’s symptoms could be an overreaction
to depression- but that’s out of my field.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Depression?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, you mentioned her father… the
divorce.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you think I should take her to see a
psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Oh no. I’d wait and see what happens with
the Ritalin. I think that’s the answer. Wait two or three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And those lies she’s been telling?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Lies?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ya know, those things to get attention, like
saying that her bed shakes and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Have you ever known your daughter to
swear and use obscenities?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, you see, that’s quite similar to
things like her lying- uncharacter-</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wait a minute. What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, she let loose quite a string while
I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re kidding! Like what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, I’d say her vocabulary’s rather
extensive.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a
for instance!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey, come on, I’m grown-up. What’d she say? I
mean specifically, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she
advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She used those words?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: She used those words. Look, I doubt that
she even understood what she was saying.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don’t think a
psychiatrist-?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: The best explanation is always the
simplest one. Let’s wait. Let’s wait and see. In the meantime try not to
worry.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my
Gin.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Never seen it before in my life. Have
you?</p>
<p><strong>astronaut</strong>: Well actually Father, we’re quite
comfortable up there, at least compared to the Gemini and Mercury
program. So they were tight for space, see we’ve got about two-hundred
and ten cubic feet so we can move around.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Listen, if you ever go up there again
will you take me along?</p>
<p><strong>astronaut</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: First missionary on mars.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Tell me, was it public relations you done for
the Gestapo or community relations?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m Swiss.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yes of course. Never went bowling with
Goebbels either I suppose ah?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Nazi bastard.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Over behind the church, you know where I mean
over there, it’s a red brick wing?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: St. Mike’s.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What goes down there? I mean who’s the priest
I keep seeing, he’s there all the time. He has black hair and he’s very
intense looking?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Damien Karras.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Karras.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: That’s his office back of St. Mike’s.
He’s our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night
poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess
she was dead a couple of days before they found her.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cunting Hun! Bloody damn butchering Nazi
pig!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Bastard! I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Karl!!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You fiend!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What’s for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Listen Burke, your car is on the curbe. Luis
is waiting…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What honey?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Hi Chris. Great party.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, don’t stop. Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Listen, I don’t need any encouragement,
but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head
liner, for all eternity and they love me.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: “Down on the east side of Toyd…”</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Toyd, Toyd.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: “Toyd, that’s my home, sweet home. Can we
both think it’s…”</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Hey I, I think we have a guest.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Your gonna die up there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Regan, my God honey. I’m sorry, she’s been
sick. She didn’t know what she was saying.</p>
<p><strong>part guy1</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What made you say that Regan? Do you know
sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Mother? What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s just like the doctor said, it’s nerves
and that’s all. Okay, you just take your pills and you’ll be fine
really. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is it coming out Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Mother! Mother! Mother!!!!! Mother help!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Make it stop! What’s wrong!! I’m
scared!!!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Where’d you get the money for the Chivas
Regal? The poor box?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: That’s an insult, I got a vow of
poverty.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Where’d you get it then?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: I stole it.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: College president shouldn’t drink.
Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big
temptation.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Oh Christ! I should of been there and I
wasn’t there, I should’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: There was nothing you could do. Lye
down. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Think you can sleep?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Are you gonna steal my shoes now?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: No, I tell fortunes by reading the
crease, now shut up and go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Goodnight Dims.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Stealing is a sin.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Honey it’s to help you.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: I don’t want it, I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: You fucking bastard!!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Remember O Lord, Thy servant, Mary Karras…
who has gone before us with the sign of faith, and sleeps the sleep of
peace. Lord I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the words and I
shall be healed. May the body of Christ bring me ever lasting life.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Well, It’s a symptom of a type of
desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the
case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part
of the brain. It’s rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and
usually just before a convulsion.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Convulsion?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: The shaking of the bed, that’s doubtless
due to musuclar spasms.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed,
the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The
whole thing, with me on it!</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your
daughter is not her bed, it’s her brain.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, what causes this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It’s
a kind of seizure disorder.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look doc, I really don’t understand how her
whole personality could change.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: The temperal lobe is very common. Could
last for days, even weeks. It isn’t rare to find destructive or even
criminal behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey do me a favour will ya’. Tell me
something good.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Don’t be alarmed. If it’s a lesion in a
way she’s fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Regan, could you sit up and scoot over
here?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Regan, I’m just gonna move you down to
the table okay?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Just for a short time.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Very sticky.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now Regan you’re going to feel something, a
little bit cold and wet.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay, now you’re gonna feel a little stick
here. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay, you’re gonna feel some pressure here,
now don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hook up.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: There’s nothing there. No vascular
displacement at all. You want me to run another series?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: I don’t think so. I’d like you to see her
again.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Excuse me Doctor. Chris MacNeil is on the
phone, she says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Dr. Klein?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Yes I’m Dr. Klein, this is
Dr. Tanney.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi Sharon, things have gotten worse since we
called you, I better take you up stairs.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Is she having spasms again?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yes but they’ve gotten violent.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Did you give her the medication she
needed?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Thorazine. Before that it was
Ritalin.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Chris, Doctors.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Mrs. MacNeil, this is Doctor Tanney.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop!
It’s burning, it’s burning please mother!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So something please Doctor, Help her!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make
it…</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Alright then Regan, let’s see…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh Regan!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Keep away! The sow is mine!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Fuck me ! Fuck Me! Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Get my bag!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Stay away from me! Stay away! Mother!</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Hold her steady, Hold her tight!</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: She’s heavily sedated. She’ll probably
sleep through tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What was going on in there, how could she
jump off the bed like that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: Pathological states can induce abnormal
strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound
women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and
lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same
thing here. Same principle, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So what’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: We still think the temporal lobe…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh. What are you talking about for Christ
sake! Did you see her or not? She’s acting like a fucking out of her
mind psychotic or a split personality or…</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: There haven’t been more than a hundred
authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I
know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable
psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: A pneumoencephelogram, I would think,
pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tanney</strong>: What we missed in the EEG and the
arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would
eliminate certain other possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.
In other words normal.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Do you keep any drugs in your house?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. Of course not, nothing like that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well of course I’m sure. I’d tell you.
Christ, I don’t even smoke grass.</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. I’m building a new house, the old one’s
been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she
finished school here. Why d’you ask?</p>
<p><strong>dr. klein</strong>: I think it’s time we started looking for
a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sharon?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shar?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sharon!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What the hell do you mean going out and
leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window’s wide
open…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What didn’t he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Didn’t who tell me?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Burke.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s Burke got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had
him to stay with her and… Oh, I should of known better.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, well I guess you should’ve.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What did the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We have to start looking for a shrink.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi Chuck, c’mon in.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I suppose you’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Heard what?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You haven’t heard.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Burke’s dead. He must of been drunk. He fell
down from the top of the steps right outside, by the time he hit ‘M’
Street he’d broken his neck.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh Burke! Poor Burke!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I guess everything-</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Call the doctor!</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Now when I touch your forehead, open
your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Are you comfortable Regan?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Is there someone inside you?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Is it Captain Howdy?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: If I ask him to tell me, will you let
him answer?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: If he talks to me, I think he’ll leave
you. Do you want him to leave you?</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: I’m talking to the person inside of
Regan now. If you are there you too are hypnotised and must answer all
my questions. Come forward answer me now.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Are you the person inside of
Regan?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: ARGHHHH Harold!!! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Father Karras?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: No we haven’t met, but they said I could
tell; that you looked like a boxer.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: William F. Kinderman. Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Yeah, it’s true. You do look like a
boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone
told you that Father?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Do people tell you look like Paul
Newman?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You this director was doing a film here,
Burke Dennings?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You’ve seen him. You’re also familiar
with how last week he died?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Only what I read in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Papers. Tell me, what do you know about
the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I once did a paper on it</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: From the psychiatric end.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I know. I read it. These desecration’s in
the church�you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass.
Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: And Dennings, you read how he died?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Yeah, a fall.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Let me tell you how Father, and please
confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of
those steps leading to ‘M’ Street, with his head turned completely
around. Facing backwards.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Couldn’t it of happened on the fall.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: It’s possible. Possible however�</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Exactly. So on the one hand we’ve got a
witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the
church.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You think the killer and the desecrator are
the same?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a
spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Sick priest, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Look, Father this is hard for you-
please. But for priests on the campus here, you’re the psychiatrist;
you’d know who was sick at the time, who wasn’t. I mean this kind of
sickness. You’d know that.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I don’t know anyone who fits the
description.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Ah, doctor’s ethics. If you knew you
wouldn’t tell, huh?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No I probably wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Not to bother you with trivia, but a
psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the
judge what he knew about a patient.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: No, I mentioned it only in passing.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Incidentally I mention only in passing that
I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Hey, Father? You like movies?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I get passes to the best shows in town.
Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: That’s to bad.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I
like to talk film; discuss the critique. D’you wanna see a film with me?
I got passes to The Crest. It’s Othello.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Who’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Who’s in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona,
and Othello, Groucho Marx. You’re happy?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: One last time: Can you think of some
priest who fits the bill?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Answer the question, Father Paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Alright. You know who I think really did
it?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: The Dominicans. Go pick on them.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I could have you deported, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I lied!</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You look like Sal Mineo!</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: It looks like a type of disorder
that you rarely ever see anymore, except in primitive cultures.</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: We call it a somnambuliform
possession.</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: Quite frankly, we don’t know much
about it except that it’s starts with some conflict or guilt that
eventually leads to the patient’s delusion that his body’s been invaded
by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look, I’m telling you again and you’d better
believe it, I’m not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: It’s-</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I don’t care what you call it! I’m not
putting her away!</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors
and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Will you just name it, for God’s sake? What
is it?</p>
<p><strong>male doctor</strong>: Do you have any religious beliefs?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: What about your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: Have you ever heard of
exorcism?</p>
<p><strong>clinic director</strong>: It’s a stylized ritual in which
rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It’s
pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in
the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although
not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of
suggestion. The victim’s belief in possession helped cause it; and just
in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re telling me that, I should take my
daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Karl? Did you put this in Regan’s
bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: She is going to be well?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Karl if you put this in Regan’s room I want
you to tell me, now did you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No. It wasn’t me. I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This was under Regan’s pillow. Did you put it
there?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Of course I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I didn’t put it.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Excuse me Miss?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: A man to see you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What man?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Does your daughter remember if perhaps
Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, she was heavily sedated.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: It’s serious?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes, I’m affraid it is.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: May I ask…?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We still don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall
when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No thanks Karl.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s okay Karl.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Strange…strange…so baffling. The deceased
comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very
sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it’s not
likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn’t do to
his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My
opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And
the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have
mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that
the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter’s window. But
no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be
one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and
the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. Not at all,</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You were expecting a deliver y that
day?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Groceries maybe? A package?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I really wouldn’t know, you see Karl takes
care of that.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Want to ask him?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Would you like some more coffee?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: That’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Your daughter, she’s the artist?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Incidentally, just a chance in a million,
I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw
Mr. Dennings in her room that night?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look, he wouldn’t have any reason to be up
there in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I know that. I realize. But if a certain
British doctor never asked “What’s this fungus?” we wouldn’t today have
penicillin. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: When she’s well enough, I’ll ask.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Couldn’t hurt. In the meantime…</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I hate to ask you this but… for my
daughter could you maybe give an autograph?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Of course. Have you got a pen?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Oh, she’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I lied. It’s for me. The spelling is on
the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that
six times.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really? wow.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You’re a very nice lady.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re a nice man.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I’ll come back when she’s feeling
better.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Please! No!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Please no!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: You bitch! Do it! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: No! Please! No!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Let Jesus fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck
you!!!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Lick me! Lick me!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Chris?</p>
<p><strong>regan/burke</strong>: Do you know what she did, your cunting
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Chris MacNeil?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Please go away.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I’m Father Karras.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, I’m very sorry Father. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: That’s okay. I should’ve told you I wouldn’t
be in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, it would’ve helped. Have you gotta
cigarette Father?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, how’d a shrink ever get to be a
priest?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: It’s the other way around. The society sent
me through med school.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re a friend of Father Dyer, right?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Yes am.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Pretty close?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Pretty close.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did he tell you about my party?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Sure did.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: About my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No I didn’t know you had one.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He didn’t mention?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Didn’t tell you of what she did?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: He didn’t mention her.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: That depends.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: The priest.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I mean, what if a person, let’s say, was a
criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to
you for help, would you have to turn him in?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: If he came to me for spritual help, I’d say
no.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No I wouldn’t. But I’d try to persuade him
to turn himself in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And how do you go about getting an
exorcism?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: If a person was possessed by a demon of some
kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Well, the first thing I’d do is put them
into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I didn’t get you?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Well it just doesn’t happen anymore
Mrs. MacNeil.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh yeah, since when?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard.
Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I’ve never met one
priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody
very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Father Karras it’s my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: That’s all the more reason to forget about
exorcism.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why, I don’t understand?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: To begin with it could make things
worse.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But how?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Well before the church approves an exorcism,
it conducts an investigation to see if it’s warranted. That takes time.
In the meantime…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You could do it yourself…</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No I couldn’t, I have to have church
approval, and frankly, that’s rarely given,-</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Could you see her?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Yes I could, I could see her as a
psychiatrist…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She’s
already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to
you, now you’re gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won’t somebody
help her!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No, you don’t understand. Your daughter-</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, will you help her! Just help her!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: It wants no straps.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Hello Regan. I’m a friend of your mother,
I’d like to help you.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: You might loosen the straps then.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I’m affraid you might hurt yourself
Regan.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: I’m not Regan.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I see. Well then let’s introduce ourselves,
I’m Damien Karras.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: And I’m the Devil! Now kindly undo
these straps!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: If you’re the devil, why not make the straps
disappear?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: That’s much to vulgar a display of
power Karras.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Where’s Regan?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: In here. With us.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Show me Regan and I’ll loosen one of the
straps.</p>
<p><strong>regan/homeless guy</strong>: Can you help an old altar boy
Fa-dah?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Your mother’s in here with us Karras,
would you like to leave a message? I’ll see that she gets it.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: If that’s true, then you must know my
mother’s maiden name. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Thanks. Look, I’m only against the
possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nothing you could do would make it any
worse.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I can’t do it. I need evidence that the
church would accept as signs of possession.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Like her speaking in a language that she’s
never known or studied.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I don’t know. I’ll have to look it up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought you were supposed to be an
expert.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: There are no experts. You probably know as
much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn’t say
she’s a demon, she says she’s the devil himself and if you’ve seen as
many psychotics as I have, you’d know it’s like saying you’re Napoleon
Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six
months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You show me Regan’s double: same face, same
voice, same everything. I’d know it wasn’t Regan. I’d know in my gut and
I’m telling you that that thing upstairs isn’t my daughter! And I want
you to tell me that you know for a fact that there’s nothing wrong with
my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an
exorcism wouldn’t do any good! You tell me that!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Did Regan know a priest was coming over?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Did you know my mother died recently?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes I did, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No, is Regan aware of it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not at all. Why d’you ask?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: It’s not important good night.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples
and said “Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body.” When the
supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise.
Gave the cup to his disciples and said “Take this, all of you will drink
from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting
covenant and the mystery of faith”.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: What an excellent day for an
exorcism.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You’d like that?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Intensely.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: But wouldn’t that drive you out of
Regan?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: It would bring us together.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You and Regan?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: You and us.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Uh Huh.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: In time.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No now.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: In time. But mirabile dictu, don’t you
agree?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You speak Latin?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Ego te abslovo.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Quod nomen mihi est?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Bon Jour.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Quod nomen mihi est?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: La plume de ma tante.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: How long are you planning to stay in
Regan?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Until she rots and lie stinking in the
earth.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Holy water.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: You keep it away.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! It burns!
Ohhhh! It burns!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Emit su evig!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I!
Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma
I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, I’ll talk to you some other time. No
it’s just that I’m going through something and… No, no there’s nothing.
Thanks alot. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wanna drink.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Scotch, Ice, water.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No ice. I’ll get some from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No it’s alright I’ll take it straight.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: It’s fine really, sit.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Where’s Regan’s father?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: In Europe.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Have you told him what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Well I think you should.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I told Regan that was holy water, I
sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It’s tap
water.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Holy water’s blessed. And that doesn’t help
support a case for possession.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She…killed Burke Dennings.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out
of the window.</p>
<p><strong>lab director</strong>: It’s a language alright. It’s
english.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: What do you mean english?</p>
<p><strong>lab director</strong>: It’s english in reverse, listen.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Give us time! Let her die!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: I am no one! I am no one! He is a
priest!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Uoy era ohw.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Merrin! Merrin!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: I am no one! I am no one! He is a
priest!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Uoy era ohw.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Yeah, yes?…I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t want Chris to see this.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Well what’s wrong? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: You’re convinced that it’s genuine.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I don’t know. No, not really I suppose. But
I’ve made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in
the Ritual.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: You’d want to do the exorcism
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: It might be best to have a man with
experience. Maybe someone who’s spent time in the foreign missions.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I see, your excellency.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Let’s see whose around. In the meantime
I’ll call you as soon as I know.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Thank you your excellency.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Well, he does know the background. I
doubt there’s any danger in just having him assist. There should be a
psychiatrist present, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: And what about the exorcist? Any
ideas?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How about Lankaster Merrin.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq.
I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That’s right Mike. But he’s finished and
came back around three ot four months ago, He’s in Woodstock now.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: What’s he doing there? Teaching?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: No, he’s working on another book.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Don’t you think he’s too old, though?
How’s his health?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It must be alright. He’s still running
around digging up tombs. Besides, he’s had experience.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa.
The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Mrs. MacNeil?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: I’m Father Merrin.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Is Father Karras here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes. He’s already here.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Father Karras.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: It’s an honour to meet you Father.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: MERRIN!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Are you tired?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: I would like you to go quickly over to the
resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a
purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The Large one. I believe we should begin.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Do you want to hear the background of the
case, first?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Especially important is the warning to avoid
conversation with the demon.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: We may ask what is relevant, but anything
beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie
to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don’t listen,
remember that, do not listen.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: I think it would be helpful if I gave you
some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So
far, there seems to be three. She’s convinced-</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: There’s only one.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Stick your cock up her ass! You mother
fucking, worthless cocksucker!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Be silent!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Our Father who art in heaven…</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily
bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: But deliver us from the evil one.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Save me o’ God by thy name, by thy might
defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence
seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every
need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: As it was in the begin is now and ever shall
be, world without end, amen.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Save your servant</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Who places her trust in thee, my God.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Be unto her o’ Lord a fortified tower.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: In the face of the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Let the enemy have no power over her.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm
her.</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras,
you faithless slime!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: O’Lord hear my prey.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And also with you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father,
everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for
all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your
only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Hasten to our call for help and snatch from
ruination and from the clutches of the noonday devil, this human being
made in your image and likeness. Strike terror Lord, into the beast, now
laying waste your vineyard, let your mighty hand cast him out of your
servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil, so he may no longer hold captive this
person, whom it pleased you to make in your image.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …and to redeem through your son. Who lives
and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and
ever.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Amen</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: O’Lord hear my preyer.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The
reponse please Damien!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus
Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the
power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy
servant pardon for all my sins…</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Bastards! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …and the power to confront this cruel
demon.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Amen</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you
hostile power. O’Lord hear my prayer.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: And also with you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit…!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Shove it up your ass you faggot!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It
is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to
the depths of hell!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Fuck him!!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …Be gone!!</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …from this creature of God!!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Be gone!! In the name of the Father, and of
the son, and of the holy spirit!! By this sign of the holy cross, of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the father and the holy
spirit…</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Damien!!!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Defender of the human race…</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: …look down in pity…</p>
<p><strong>regan/demon</strong>: You killed your mother!!! You left her
alone to die!!!! She’ll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Shut up!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: … upon this your servant, Regan Teresa
MacNeil.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: I command you by the judge of the living and
the dead, to depart from this servant of God.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: It’s the power! - Holy water.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: It’s the power of Christ, that compels
you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin + karras</strong>: The power of Christ compels
you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin + karras</strong>: The power of Christ compels
you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin + karras</strong>: The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. The
power of Christ compels you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin + karras</strong>: The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. The
power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. The power
of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin + karras</strong>: The power of Christ compels
you.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: He brought you low by his bloodstained
cross! Do not despise my command because you no me to be a sinner. It’s
God himself who commands you! The majestic Christ who commands! God the
Father commands you! God the son commands you!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: God the holy spirit commands you!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: The mystery of the cross commands you! The
blood of the martyrs commands you!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers.
You’re guilty, before Almighty God, guilty before his son, guilty before
the whole human race. It’s the Lord who expels you. He who is coming to
judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Are you tired?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Let’s rest before we start again.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Why this girl it makes no sense?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: I think the point is to make us dispair… To
see our selves as… animal and ugly… To reject the possibillity that God
could love us.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Will you excuse me, Damien?</p>
<p><strong>regan/mrs. karras</strong>: Dimmy, why you did this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>regan/mrs. karras</strong>: Please Dimmy, I’m affraid.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You’re not my mother.</p>
<p><strong>regan/mrs. karras</strong>: Dimmy please!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Her heart.</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Can you give her something?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: She’ll go into coma.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You’re not my mother!!!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Don’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>regan/mrs. karras</strong>: Why, Dimmy?</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Damien.</p>
<p><strong>regan/mrs. karras</strong>: Dimmy, please!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Damien! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>merrin</strong>: Our Father, who art in heaven…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is she gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: Take me! Come into me! God damn you! Take
me! Take me!</p>
<p><strong>karras</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Mother…Mother…Mother…Mother…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Rags?</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Somebody fell at the bottom of the steps
here!</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Do you want to make your confession?
Are you sorry- Are you sorry for having offended God, with all the sins
of your past life? Ego to abslovo in nomine patris, et filli, et
spiritus sancti. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where do you want this?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Phonograph.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Storage.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m gonna miss you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure you won’t change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I found this in her room.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s everything.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Regan! C’mon honey we have to get going!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She doesn’t remeber a thing.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: All done.</p>

<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: Who’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the
role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: Another one. Had your lunch?</p>
<p><strong>father dyer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: I’m reminded of a line in the film
Casablanca. At the end Humphrey Bogart says to Claude Rains, ” Louie- I
think this is the begining of a beautiful friendship.”</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: You know you look a bit like Bogart.</p>
<p><strong>kinderman</strong>: You noticed.</p>
