<h1 id="the-adjustment-bureau">the-adjustment-bureau</h1>
<p><strong>voice on pa system</strong>: Thank you so much for coming
today– A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.</p>
<p><strong>blue blazer</strong>: Congressman Norris-? Now REVEAL that
we’re ±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St. Johns University.
A thousand people crowd the quad out front. “Norris for Senate” placards
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>blue-blazer</strong>: Fred O’Malley with the DNC. I’ve never
seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle. CHARLIE TRAYNOR,
36, arrives–.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just wait ’till you see how they respond to
him.. David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his
lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t build me up like that, Charlie. He’ll
be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi there. I’m David Norris. And I’m running
for the US Senate.</p>
<p><strong>montage – senate campaign</strong>: –David finishes a speech
at the FDNY Academy’s graduation. The cadets jump to their feet and give
him a standing ovation. –David shakes the hands of workers entering a
.Con Edison plant in Buffalo. He’s a natural at this. Unlike most
politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning. –Flashbulbs go off
as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx
teenagers. Charlie is nearby. –David takes a ceremonial shovel full of
dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate. –He gives a
speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch David the way they watched
JFK, the way they watch Obama today. He inspires, makes them believe,
makes them want to follow him. Especially young people. –David walks
through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and
citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones. People crush around
him. He:doesn’t seem to mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
–He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to
speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to
compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie stands nearby watching him
speak:.</p>
<p>****: Karen Woods, founder. Husband: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little
League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John’s grad. Two year old: Loyita…
He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Realtor’s
Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out.</p>
<p>****: Abagail “Abby” Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan
Sabovic, Jim Vargas… His ability to retain this sort of information is
stunning. He doesn’t need to review. It’s already all there. He closes
his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks out at the trees. The
silence back…it’s deafening.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What the hell? What happened to “I’m going
to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?” You have Diane
Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in
time. David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand he
picks up a cup and saucer.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I had some tea.</p>
<p>****: Come on, man. We’re eight points up in the polls. I’ve gotta
cut loose every once in a while and have a life. This provokes a
quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate
Sheraton doesn’t seem like having a life to him…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Latest poll has you ten points up. A slow
smile spreads across David’s face.</p>
<p><strong>black screen</strong>: The sound of a busy room. Then one
voice, much louder:</p>
<p><strong>campaign aide.</strong>: County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield,
7233 for Norris.</p>
<p>****: Better than I thought, I thought we’d get killed in Seneca. He
turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris
supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell are the.
Suffolk numbers? We’ve got to get the Suffolk numbers!</p>
<p><strong>pundit #1</strong>: Congressman Norris has a reputation for
being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great
until you say too many things you wish you hadn’t. Then you start to
look like an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>pundit #2</strong>: That’s bad for any candidate but it’s
fatal if you’re running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps
calling you an “impulsive kid,” and you almost killed your entire
political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up
on the front page of`.the New York Post. David winces slightly. This is
excruciating. Just then Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is
visible through the open door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>-charlie</strong>: Why are you still watching CNN? They
called this way too early. David doesn’t share his friend’s
optimism.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Suffolk County Numbers! Charlie and David
emerge from the private room to listen.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Lynfield: 415,120. Norris:</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I really thought we’d win Suffolk.</p>
<p><strong>senior aide</strong>: Kings County just came in too.</p>
<p><strong>a brutal</strong>: He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and
David. beat…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, it’s over. And it’s going to be a
blowout… David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he’s going to lose
big. It’s going to be a grand,. public humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>senior aide</strong>: NBC has us up next. Charlie takes a
clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.</p>
<p><strong>brian williams</strong>: Turning now to the New York Senate
race, NBC is now calling the election for Roger’Lynfield. After a
shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county,
Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly,
perhaps by as much as 10 points.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: This is a.bignight, gentleman.</p>
<p>****: Is ever ything set? Harry nods. Richardson notices his
eyes:</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You look tired. You should take a
vacation when we finish with this. You’ll have earned it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not sure the kind of tired I feel would
be fixed by a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Sure it would. Everybody needs a
vacation. Even us.</p>
<p>****: I’m going to take a walk, figure out my speech.</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: Good evening, Congressman. You’re
in the Grand Ballroom if that’s what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Actually just looking for a place to be alone
for a minute before I head in there.</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: None of the banquet rooms on the
third floor are in use tonight.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi. I hope I didn’t startle you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hiding from security.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh… . What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Crashed a wedding. One floor up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s almost midnight. They’just caught on
now?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn’t her
niece. I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent
started slipping. spite of David’s state that gets a grin.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you for real?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Life is short.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hard to argue with that.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re that guy running for Senate aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m “that guy.”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You winning?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Too bad. The other guy’s a tool.</p>
<p>****: Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Personally, I think mooning your friends at a
college reunion is no big deal.</p>
<p>****: And I don’t think the Post should have printed the photo. David
just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that down and he knows
it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: At least not full page. He can’t help but
crack up.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen, I’ve done it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You weren’t running, for Senate at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Do you still have a chance or is it over?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an
exceptional gift for conveying empathy…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You must …I don’t know what you must be
feeling…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Winning would feel better. But losing has its
advantages.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The only time a politician is alone is when
he’s asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that
gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a
curious look.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Watching you, you’d never know it. The way
she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others
miss in him – even if he isn’t even quite sure what it is. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, everything happens for a reason, right?
Even losing. God, I’m really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark
in people.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: After it kills their Czech accents. She
offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why not? I have to think up some good
platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why the hell would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Apparently, even if I hadn’t been caught
dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost
the election anyway because I’m too blunt.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The TV pundits.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Fuck ’em. They just wish they had the balls
to be candidates themselves. She hands him the champagne bottle
again.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And they work for the Man anyway.</p>
<p>****: You going to run again?</p>
<p>****: Tonight’s probably not the night to ask.</p>
<p>****: No, it is. Look at me. You have to run again. Do-yo hear me?
She’s serious about this. Intense.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Otherwise the-country will be run by tools.
like Lynwood.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “Field.” “Lynfield.” A beat. She shrugs. Then
they lean toward each other… and kiss. It turns more and more
passionate. When they finally pull apart:</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Holy shit. She seems just as surprised. They
look at each other and laugh. Just then the bathroom door opens. It’s
Charlie. He sees David and the woman.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: David?</p>
<p>****: I better go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wait. The woman turns to face David. Suddenly
two hotel guards turn the corner and spot the woman.</p>
<p><strong>hotel security</strong>: There! They rush toward her.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Gotta go. Don’t let the bastards grind you
down. She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m really not sure. David has a huge grin on
his face.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But I think I’m ready to give my speech.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I grew up in Red Hook and I don’t want to
shock anybody but I got in a few fist fights along the way. Laughter
ripples through the crowd. We don’t know enough yet to get the joke.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And we used to have a saying when you got in
a fight: “it’s not whether or not you get knocked down – because
eventually everyone does – it’s what you do when you get back up.”</p>
<p>****: Don’t worry, I’m not going to moon you. The audience explodes
with laughter this time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But I am… But I am going to get backup. I
wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech
I’ve dreamed of giving foremost of my life. But life doesn’t always deal
you the cards you want. The audience sobered now. Reflective.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My life changed when I was ten years old. My
entire world turned upside-down.’ His audience,. knows exactly what he’s
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And as I looked for something to -hang ;on
to, something; to help me cope’ with what had. happened the only thing
that made sense to me was service. Finding a way to do something with my
life that left this world a little better than I found it. The audience
is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab at their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: He spills his coffee when he steps out
of Starbucks. The moment he comes through the door.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Our models indicate between 7:00 and
7:05 am. Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.</p>
<p><strong>richard son</strong>: You planned that vacation, right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Two weeks. Richardson claps him din-the
shoulder and leaves. Harry watches him go.</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: RSR Capital announced yesterday that
David Norris would become its Vice Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: Norris worked at Goldman Sachs for four
years before running for Congress at the tender age of 25.</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: He served four terms in the House– The
blackberry rings.</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: –prior to his unsuccessful bid for
Senate in last week’s election. David rushes over and ?icks=up the
blackberry. He has to look for a second to figure out how to hit
“answer.”</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: RSR, one ofthe country’s fastest-
growing hedge funds is run by NO ris’s former Goldman colleague and
campaign chairman, Charles</p>
<p><strong>’raynor–</strong>: The blackberry rings again. It’s very
loud.</p>
<p><strong>cnbc anchor</strong>: . his . electrifying concession speech
led commentators to– Finally David finds the answer button as he mutes
the TV.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tom Frankel from the Journal is calling you
in five minutes. I just gave him this number.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Give him 3227. I’m not used to this phone
yet.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Can’t. He’s going to ask you about joining
the firm. My compliance guys say all firm business has to be done on the
blackberry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sarbanes-Oxley. You voted for it, pal. In
fact, you cosponsored it.</p>
<p><strong>int morning</strong>: .As David pays, he notices Harry
sprinting for the bus.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sir, there’s someone–</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: There’s another M1 right behind me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No way… It’s the woman from election night.’,
He leans around to try to see the front of her face. “It’s definitely
her. His eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes. She
recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she realizes who it
is.</p>
<p>****: I think. we “ve met.</p>
<p>****: You need a better line than that or I’ll have to assume you’re
a pervert who likes to stare at girls’ legs while-, they sleep.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Your skirt was so short I couldn’t help
it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Dress.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Skirt, dress, same thing.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If you’re a pervert, yeah. All that matters
is they both show leg.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So do shorts, dear.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah, but there’s that pesky piece of fabric
right here that interferes with your fantasy life. She shuts her eyes
and leans against the window.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Wake me when you have a good come back to
that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have one but, unlike you, I wouldn’t say it
in public.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Pussy. David laughs. Can not believe this
woman. In a good way. His blackberry RINGS. Her eyes pop open.
David.picks up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello…? Hello? David looks at his. phone. The
signal has gone to zero.</p>
<p>****: The line cut.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That ringer get any-louder or do you pretty
much have it maxed out?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re relentless.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I never sleep through the night. I catch up
on the bus.</p>
<p>****: You going to run again?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just started a new job, today.</p>
<p>****: I saw your concession speech. I heard Bill Clinton called it
the best political speech he’s seen in 20 years. David looks back at
her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Something got into me. He means her. They
stare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s the deal with you and argyles?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What’s the deal with you and boring shades of
blue? David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie. A
beat.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: At least my clothes match.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s easy if you. restrict yourself to one
color.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The belt and shoes are black.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Variety is the spice of .life .</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There you` go with the platitudes again. I
guess it wasn’t the ch mpagne . His blackberry goes again.
RING-RING.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello? Hello? He shakes his head. It’s dead
again.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Your phone sucks. Don’t guys like you get
special phones that actually work in the middle of the biggest city in
the country?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Depends what the telecom lobby thinks of your
voting record.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shit! He’s looking at a leather portfolio. We
catch a glimpse inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the
book, look’s up to get a bead on” the the bus, then takes off down
Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll pay for the damage. He pulls out his
wallet. There’s $7 inside. She laughs.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hope your new job pays better than your old
one.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Give me your number and I’ll send you a
check.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: God, that is smooth. Spill coffee on me then
ask for my number. She takes the coffee from his hands and casually
takes a sip, then turns back to him with a devilish look in her
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Just let me spill some on you and we’ll be
even. She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s my first day at the office!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee
on you on the MI. It’s New York; he’ll understand. She thrusts the cup
back at him-</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over
hers.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Just a little. They struggle with the cup. &lt;,;:Both
suppressing laughter.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on
David’s lap’RINGS again. She snatches it with her free hand.</p>
<p>****: He’s not here! She hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He
lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her
body.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What is this, third grade?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You forgot what that was like, didn’t you?
How fun it was… That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS
again.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh my God! How do you stand it? She drops the
phone into the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: There. We’re even. He stares at her.
Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows what would come next if they were
in private… The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sturdy little fucker, isn’t it? She pulls the
phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf, pushing the button
which sends the call to voice mail. Then she reaches out her hand, as if
to shake.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: By the way, I’m Elise.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking
about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dammit! Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue
now, right behind the bus– HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi
skid into him. TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Guess who I just sat down next to on the
bus?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The woman from election night.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The one you kissed?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She kissed me. I just didn’t fight it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re shitting me. Just randomly you sit
down next to– He’s cut off mid-word.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Charlie? David looks at his phone. “Call
Lost” on the screen. David hits redial. Gets a fast busy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: ’ . This is ridiculous. He pockets his
phone.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Are you okay? Harry is sitting now,
wincing, but still searching intently for something.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m fine– Will you hand me that? Harry points
at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away. We’ll come to
know it as a “PLANBOOK.”</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay? The driver
hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first
good look at that circuit diagram: Thousands of interconnected lines.
Dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points. And written
notations in a language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
And, maybe it’s just a trick of the light but several of the lines
appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh…shit…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay… Daviddecides he doesn’t need to
announce himself.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Doesn’t anybody bother getting in before
eight at this place? David passes a couple of empty offices on his way
towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
marked “Charles Traynor, Chairman.” She’s smiling.</p>
<p>****: Susan! How are you today? Susan? David looks closer across her
desk. Her face is frozen.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Susan? He leans across her desk, touches her
arm. She stays dead still. David rushes through Charlie’s door:</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Call 911! Something’s wrong with Susan!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by
the window spin to see David. it’s Mr. Richardson and-two aides we
recognize as the “security guards” who chased Elise away on election
night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell are you doing?! Richardson
blinks Clearly surprised. Then:</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Grab him! David bolts out of the office
as they lunge at him–</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You can’t get away, David. David spins
and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to
the floor below. Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. As
he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid.
David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson,
coming out of another office. down the hall. Again, physically
impossible for him to get there that fast– David spins and– A DISTORTED
WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN
AND OUT… FROM DAVID’S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he’s carried toward one of
the large corner offices on the 40th floor. The nameplate reads “Steve
Kincaid.” Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying
David,</p>
<p><strong>inside –</strong>: Except when they walk through the door
they’re not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step
inside a large warehouse… Their movement completely violates the laws of
physics.</p>
<p><strong>black screen</strong>: Silence. Then voices come up
slowly:</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand
that, sir. Absolutely. I’ll do that, sir.</p>
<p>****: What a goddamm mess.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Was that Donaldson?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Can you reset him?</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: I don’t think we have the authority in a
situation like this.</p>
<p><strong>burdensky .</strong>: Legal just arrived.</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: Re-setting’s off the table. This is our
fault:… Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off
to the side, clearly disgraced. David, who is tied to a chair facing
away from Richardson, cranes around to see who’s talking.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a
beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves – though at a lower
volume.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: What are my options?</p>
<p>****: You could bullshit him but you’ll never be completely
successful.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can somebody tell me what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: The questions will burn in him till the
day he dies. You’ll have to monitor him constantly…</p>
<p><strong>on david</strong>: He can hear little snippets of what
Burdensky’s saying–</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: .to make sure he doesn’t talk… the
endless ripple effects… REVEAL David untying the rope restraining
him.</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: If it were me, I’d level with him.</p>
<p><strong>ric:hardson</strong>: Completely?</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: That’s the only way to extinguish his
curiosity. Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
An uncomfortable pause.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: We’re the people v ho make sure things
happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then
leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He sprints toward an
open door forty feet across the warehouse. Richardson makes a little
gesture with his hand–</p>
<p><strong>close-up of the floor</strong>: It cracks.. .and displaces
upward.. .so it’s uneven just as David’s foot comes down on it.</p>
<p><strong>back to wide shot</strong>: David trips and goes flying–</p>
<p><strong>moments later</strong>: David is dragged back to the center
of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Did you really think I couldn’t see that
coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: I can read your mind! David stares
back.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Yeah, really…</p>
<p>****: Choose a color. Blue. Choose a number. Seventeen. David’s jaw
drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Now,. why are you still deciding whether
or not to run? David’s hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an
atavistic response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
spilling out into view.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You saw the futility of that back at the
office. David’s entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
point. He can’t hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based
in the world he’s known to date…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell is happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You just saw behind a curtain you
weren’t even supposed to know was there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring. I’m
sure.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just… came to work…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: It wasn’t your fault. Your Path through
the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted. Your coffee was
supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your
apartment. You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten
minutes later than you did. By then we would have left.</p>
<p>****: People call it “chance” when their coffee spills or their
internet goes down or they misplace their keys. Sometimes it is.
Sometimes it’s:us…nudging you back on Plan. David takes all this in.
He’s still shell-shocked.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Whatever you were doing to Charlie back
there… it wasn’t misplacing his keys.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Sometimes. when nudging a person back on
Plan isn’t enough we intervene directly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why Charlie? What did you do to him.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You need to worry about getting back on
your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his. David
stares back, still trying to get his bearings.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Only a handful of human beings know what
you now know, David. We’re determined to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: So before I let you go, you need to
understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase
your brain. Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will
be expunged. Your friends and family will think you’ve gone crazy. You
won’t “think” anything because a blank slate can’t “think.” Davidstares
back.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Do you understand what I just said?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Not a word. Not one word about us.</p>
<p>****: okay … . you’re free to go. David stands there a monent..:.not
sure it’s real. Richardson points at the door. David walks toward it.
Just then another man comes up to Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>new man in suit</strong>: There’s awoman.</p>
<p>****: There’s always &amp; Woman… Richardson motions;to his men.
At.-THE DOOR Two men come through from outside and block David’s
exit.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He said I could go.</p>
<p><strong>new man in suit</strong>: You won’t believe who she is. He
holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: How is that possible? Why didn’t we get
an alert?</p>
<p><strong>new man in suit</strong>: He wasn’t supposed to be on that
bus. He was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment… It was a
controlled situation. It was supposed to be. The new man looks at
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>at the door</strong>: David looks back at Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You said I could go. Richardson walks over to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ric,hardson</strong>: You ran into a woman named Elise on the
bus this morning?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why does it’matter?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You weren’t ever supposed to see her
again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why do you care.?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Because, David, you can’t be with her.
And we didn’t want to have to resort to this– Four big guys grab David
and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a
prisoner. Richardson reaches into David’s pocket and pulls out his
wallet–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell– What are you– Richardson
removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her number on from David’s
wallet–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No! And burns Elise’s number. David strains
and tries to pull loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention
Team men. But he can’t get free.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What is wrong with you people?! Richardson
drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn. ON David’s reaction CUT
TO:</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’re David Norris, right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ice water.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’s it? David nods. Harry arrives.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We should talk. But not here. Go back to work
and I’ll contact you later today with a place to meet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay. Harry can see that David is still very
shaken.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The world’s exactly the same as it’s always
been. You just understand it more completely now.</p>
<p>****: Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you’ll
be fine.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. IKincaid’s in the finance meeting,
Congressitan. Main conference room. David turns to see her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get
his bearings in the new reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a
corner.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There you are. I called your cell ten
times. You left me hanging.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p>****: Are you okay? Come on, we’re late. Happy first day by the way.
They head towards the conference room.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You sure you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Fine. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Great. Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No headaches or–</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just, me or
is this an odd conversation? What the hell happened with the girl?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: After the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>int rsr capital offices – day</strong>: David and Charlie
walk back to David’s office.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Please explain to me why you don’t have an
ear-to-ear smile right now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I lost her number.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You lost her number?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was pickpocketed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on. You can’t be serious. You’re
serious… Oh, man…dude. I’m sorry… I’m really sorry…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A lot of people just collapse when they see
what you’ve s’een. Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to
them. Life starts to feel pointless.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was` raised to believe there’s something
behind the curtain. I just never pictured it quite like this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Most people don’t. Harry looks over his
shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues. He’s far from
relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You should know. You can read my mind,
right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Richardson was just trying to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He knew what color I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because he set it up as a choice. “Choose a
color. Choose a number”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So? Harry looks away. He’s crossing a line.
He’s really putting himself out there:</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We can’t read your mind or hear your
thoughts. But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we
percpite that. We know if you’re going to go off Plan “or not because,
as long as we’re close enough, we cansense it when it’s about to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: it-;’ s like a sixth sense for you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Seventh, actually.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What did they do too Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Made some small change in the way he assesses
risk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What type of risk?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know. Something arcane. Something to
do with mortgage- backed securities.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What would your colleagues do to you if they
knew what you were telling me? This is precisely what Harry has been
worried about.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s why we’re meeting out here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re not following me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We don’t have the manpower to follow
everybody all the time. They’re checking in on you. Just not here. Not
right now. ON David’s face considering this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you helping me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I have my reasons. David studies him.
Ha=rry’s’ clearly not ready to go into</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why do they care if I’m with Elise?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your entire reality gets shattered this
morning and you want to know about a woman?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why do they care? Harry looks back at him.
Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have no idea?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: All I know is, given the amount of resources
they’ve used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them. You’re
going to look for her aren’t you? Again, David is silent.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There are twelve million people in this city.
On a slow day. You’re not going to find her, you do realize that, don’t
yore-?</p>
<p>****: Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of
your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,’d never get
through…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They send you here to tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want my advice? Forget about her. Accept
that you’`&gt;ll never see her again. Move on with your life. ON David
as Harry’s words sink in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How are you feeling about the speech? David
has not noticeably aged and yet he’s more tempered and subdued than when
we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m ready… I changed a few things last
night.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tell me at breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>through the window at david</strong>: David finishes his
call, then looks out the window. There is a detachment in h-s eyes that
didn’t exist before. After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the
door.</p>
<p><strong>david’s pov</strong>: The bus passes a woman walking on the
sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop the bus.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: The next stop–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Elise! The woman turns around. And it’s
her…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Wow… How areyou. Reeling from the adrenaline;
David takes a moment, then:</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I rode the Ml to work every day for the last
three years hoping one day I’d run into you again. She’s amused, rather
than moved, because she doesn’t buy it.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Calling would have been easier.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Girlfriend wouldn’t let you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No girlfriend. She looks at him with
continued skepticism. But his expression is dead serious.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates.
It hurt when he didn’t call. She’s angry at herself for that, but it’s
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Don’t you have to get to work?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just got sick.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: “I haven’t seen you in three years - - You
make me sick” is not an ideal come-on. For the record. David smiles.
She’s softening. A little. His phone vibrates. He pulls it out of his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: One second.</p>
<p>****: CharlieT can’t make breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And…I might have to push the speech.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What? Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just ran into Elise. He hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You just hung up on your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ve known each other since we were kids. We
have a shorthand.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: What speech?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Doesn’t matter. Let’s take a walk. His focus
on her is absolute. But she’s wary of getting reeled in again.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Somewhere far. We have a lot to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I don’t think you should cancel your speech.
What if I don’t like you at the end of our walk?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Seri6us1y, my number hasn’t changed:. Just
call me like you didn’t last time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My-speech will always be there, you might not
be.</p>
<p>****: I was there, David. You didn’t callrie!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Walk with me and I’ll explain that. She’s
still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns it off .</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not losing you again. I’m not letting you
out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Stalker.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can we walk? The moment she finally relents,
CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>following shot</strong>: Polished black shoes running down a
corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative
silver borders.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: We have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It’s been years, David. How do you know I
don’t have a boyfriend? Oh, shit. He hasn’t even had time to think about
that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: you have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>el ;e</strong>: Would it-Matter?</p>
<p>****: Uh…yeah…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: So all the stuff about me being in your mind
constantly for the last three years was just talk… The truth is you
don’t have any real conviction.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: So you don’t care about being a
home-wrecker?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay… if you were married it would
matter.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Now you’re just trying to say what you think
I want to hear. A beat. She lets David twist in the wind…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’m single. ON David’s face: relief…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Now let’s hear your bullshit excuse for never
calling me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t have your number.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was taken from me. I was mugged.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Your number was in my Wallet and they ,:took
it.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Come on..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m serious. What else could possibly-explain
my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago…and again today and
not calling you in between?</p>
<p>****: Um, you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty. I have a thing
about being lied to, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I swear to God I didn’t have your number. I
swear on my parents’ graves.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t even have a last name to try to
track you down. Do you know how many pages come back when you type
“Elise” into Google?</p>
<p>****: And none of them were you.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You really are smooth.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It’s okay. I like it. I probably shouldn’t,
but I do.</p>
<p>****: It’s Sellas. Elise Sellas.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Tell me you’re kidding. How could our
Path-analysis miss this? McCrady just shakes his head, mystified…
Richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora:.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: ’rlhek,e are they now?`</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Central Park. Bethesda Fountain.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I read somewhere you’re running again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I haven’t announced yet but… soon.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I hope I had a little something to do with
that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That concession speech I gave sure did. You
had everything to do with that. Elise smiles.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know entirely too much about me given how
little I know about you.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: According to Cosmo I’m supposed to keep it
that way.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: According to Maxim, I’m supposed to “maintain
eye contact and ask you what you do for a living.” It’s the first witty
comment h6’ :s made this time around. He’s just barely starting
t6°’loo§`en up.</p>
<p>****: I’m a dancer.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh..</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Not like that, you pervert. In a dance
company. The. Manhattan Modern Ballet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think you have the wrong idea about me.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I think it was the first thing that crossed
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is there a performance of this company coming
up that I could watch?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Actually, we have a show opening tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m there. You hungry yet?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p>****: But I’m not putting out just because you’re buying me
brunch.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We could wait an hour and call it lunch.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I bet lines like that work wonders with the
“dancers” you normally hang out with.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So unfair…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Good morning. It’s good to see you
again,.sir.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you. You’re… Paul, right? De…Santo?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Wow, yeah. How did you remember that? It’s
been a year.</p>
<p><strong>richardson aide</strong>: Morris is on the artistic director.
Melton is on Charlie Traynor.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: This whole thing will be over in an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: We may not have that long.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: How do you do that? I can’t remember the
names of people I just met.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Right.. Thanks_.’</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Her decision tree is diverging from our
models.</p>
<p>****: 36 hours without contact and she’ll never speak to him again.
I’ve studied her file. Her deepest fear in life is–</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: No, something is wrong. I’m already seeing
inflection points. Off Richardson’s surprised look–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Ballet is basically impossible to do
correctly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You just do absurd things. with your body.
The movement is completely unnatural. It requires incredible strength in
all sorts of random muscles. And you have to be born with ridiculous
amounts of flexibility in your hip or you’ll never be an y good.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: If they kiss…</p>
<p>****: A kiss, that’s all it takes?</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: A real kiss. But once they do that every
possible adjustment that’s strong enough to break them up will cause
ripples over your limit.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: If Melton and Morris do their jobs right
we’ll be okay. But Richardson is clearly worried.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: In the history of ballet there’ve only been a
handful of people who actually did ballet the way it’s supposed to be
done. Forme that just made it completely addictive.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you ever get nervous when people watch
you?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Not really. Do you get anxious when you make
’a speech?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I get more anxious alone in my apartment than
in front of an auditorium full of people. Everything’s backwards for
me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I hate to interrupt. They turn to see
Charlie’’’aynor. I tXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO DAY Richardson turns to a
colleague, Melton, who steps through the “bar house” door.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Elise, pleasure to see you again.</p>
<p>****: There’s a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for
you.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Your speech?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s announcing today.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: At the speech?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s okay? It’s not okay. The one thing
you can’t be this. time around is impulsive. That’s why we’re announcing
the way we are,</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: God, don’t skip this for me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I told you I’m not letting you out of my
sight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: David, what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come with me. Come and watch.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Her phone buzzes with a text message.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Great. Perfect solution. Now, let’s pay and
get you over there. Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the
check.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The speech is in 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I can’t then. They just moved my dress
rehearsal to noon. David’s own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been
discovered?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We can reschedule the speech.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: David!</p>
<p>****: Thank you. David looks around for anything out of the ordinary,
any sign of Richardson or his men. But. they stay out of view. He thinks
they’re not on to him yet.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’ll meet you right after the rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where does your company perform?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: We’re n in our space. There was a`;•power ot
outage or something. We’re using a space” on Murray and West Broadway
today.</p>
<p>****: That’s four blocks from where you’re speaking. David reacts:
Richardson can’t be behind that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can literally walk there after the
speech. David nods, his suspicions fading.</p>
<p>****: But we’ve got to leave right now.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: The “four blocks” thing was a brilliant
move, boss.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: We’re not out of the woods yet. He looks
down at the inflection points in McCrady’s Planbook.</p>
<p>****: I’ve got to go that way…to stop by my apartment and change.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay. David and Elise stop to say goodbye
to-each other.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You know, the speech on election night, you
said I inspired you… I wish I could do that again now.</p>
<p><strong>est.boathouse patio day</strong>: Richardson makes a small
hand motion in Charlie’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>david and elise</strong>: David leans toward Elise–</p>
<p>****: David, the speech starts in 15 minutes. We have a 25 minute
drive.</p>
<p><strong>david and elise</strong>: David squeezes her hand… and leans
in again–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: just want to</p>
<p><strong>voice.</strong>: I hope the rumors are true, Congressman.
David pulls back fr`bm Elise, suddenly self-conscious, turns to see the
40-year old woman Richardson just manipulated. She points at the TV
report on David’s announcement.</p>
<p><strong>40 year-old woman</strong>: You have my vote.</p>
<p><strong>65 year-old woman</strong>: Mine too… and I usually disagree
with her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks. Thanks a lot. David turns back to
Elise.</p>
<p>****: Well, you’re really just a hit with women of all ages, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie – a few feet away</strong>: On the phone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m wrangling him right now–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Whatever happens…I’m not going to let
anything stand between us this time. It’s such an odd thing to say, if
you don’t know what David has gone through. She gives him a quizzical
look. But she’s also moved by his,tone</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Okay.:.. I believe you. Of course I tend to
believe in the wrong people. Especially men. It’s the kind of quip
that’s more truth than jest.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not this time. He leans in to kiss her–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll see you in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: We’re okay…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: That was way too close. What the hell is
going on with this case?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ve just never seen you like that. David
can’t possibly explain.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: “I’m going to-postpone my announcement to
have brunch with a woman?” Postpone any speech. I know she made an
impression on you but this is … Charlie just shakes his head, unable to
comprehend. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: “What is it about her?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me, it was
a surprise to me too. But I think we have it under control.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Oh, you’re clone. You’re gone…</p>
<p><strong>minutes later – day</strong>: A half-dozen news
organizations, film the speech.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: .I’m here today to honor that, and to
announce my intention to run for the United States Senate…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Just tell me if he disappears one more time
you’ll never take his call again.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Don’t worry. That’s definite.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then
you have the bankers group… David, are you listening? David’s staring
out the window. The sunlight has caught the building across the street
just right to illuminate Richardson and McCrady on the second floor.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: I ’ 11-keep you = posted, sir.
Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David. As he does
he real zes David can see him.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: D` emit ! Richardson-steps back out of
the sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>mcc- .dy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Get out of the sunlight. McCrady,
notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.</p>
<p>****: I cannot get a break on this case.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have to see Elise now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: After you go back out there and talk to the
New York channels–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Tomorrow. After GMA. He heads for the door.
Charlie follows.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, we need this on the nightly–</p>
<p>****: David… Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the
right words to say to a friend…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Every time we get close.. .you do something
to derail it. A beat. There’s a truth to that. David knows it. But–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is different. Trust me, it’s different.
David leaves.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Elise …I doubt you’ll ever get this message
but–</p>
<p><strong>jump cut</strong>: David dials 411.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can I have the number for the Manhattan
Modern Ballet…</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: He’s going to go next door:. Just then
David exits the furniture store and goes next door to a clothing
store–</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: You can’t keep.-thephones and internet down
on the whole block, for too much. longer without running into ripple
problems…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you have a phone book?</p>
<p><strong>jump cut</strong>: David gets to the phone book page that
ends with “Manhattan Mobile Phone Company.” The next page is torn out.
David slams his fist down.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: There is an entire world of women out
there. I thought I made it clear this one was off limits. David takes
off walking.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I must have forgotten. It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Doesn’t change the fact. David looks
around, trying to figure out his next move.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you so.determined to keep us
apart?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You know: why.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you misread
it.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: There’s no misreading what the Plan says
about you and Elise. It’s unequivocal.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Then your Plan’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Do you realize who wrote this Plan?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t care. Richardson grabs him and pushes
him against a brick wall.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Well you should. You need to learn a
little more respect. David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a
swing at Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that
McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you keeping us apart?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Because the Plan calls for it.</p>
<p>****: You put us together three times–</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: That was chance. That wasn’t us.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Three times? Bullshit! If I’m not supposed to
be with her then why do I feel like this?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: It doesn’t matter what you feel. It
matters what’s in black and white. David’s ready to explode: at him when
he sees something in Richardson’s eyes. David stops.. .then his whole
expression changes…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You don’t know, do you? You don’t know why
they’re keeping us apart…</p>
<p>****: ’It’s not something your mind could :comprehend.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re in a nice suit but the reality is
you’re just a minion aren’t you? David pushes past Richardson and walks
into a busy restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: He’s deciding how to–</p>
<p>****: Uh..oh–</p>
<p>****: Excuse me ladies and gentleman–</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry to disturb your lunch. I have a bit of an emergency.
Is there anybody in this room who’s ever seen a performance of the
Manhattan Modern Ballet?</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: He’s smart. He’s very smart. David exits
the restaurant from another door. He hurries toward West Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Maybe you should try the subway. David
holds him in a steely gaze.</p>
<p><strong>david’</strong>: Don’t all those cab drivers you’re diverting
have Plans too? What about all the other people looking for cabs in this
part of the city right n6t? What about their Plans? The ripples must be
endless… Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t care what you put in my way, I’m not
going to give up. David walks off, leaving Richardson standing
there.</p>
<p><strong>minutes later – day</strong>: Richardson and McCrady watch
David looking for a taxi at a very busy intersection.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: You’ve got two more minutes keeping taxis
off West Broadway before–</p>
<p>****: I need something that’s going to keep him in place longer–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus:., Is this how far you people will go?!
He rushes toward the accident–</p>
<p><strong>are</strong>: An hour later. Four police cars and an
ambulance. They treating one of the accident”s victims for minor scrapes
]avid is getting intervie,ved by a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Unfortunately you’re the only
witness, Congressman.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: A few more minutes. I’m sorry. I
know you have to meet somebody.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t say I had to meet anyone.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Well …I just assumed–</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Amateur! That’s an amateur’s
mistake!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not a real cop, are you? You’re one of
them. Somebody could have been killed in that crash! Doesn’t that make
you–</p>
<p><strong>“police officer”</strong>: Sir, calm down. But David’s
already walking away.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sergeant! He goes to the highest ranking guy
on the. scene.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know you heed a statement from me, but do I
have to stay here to give it to you or–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No, sir, we know ow to get in touch with
you.</p>
<p><strong>davs,d</strong>: Thank you. ’.Is this man under your command?
David turns to see that the “Police Officer” who was interviewing him is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: 17th Street between 10th and 11th. And sir,
you might have to break some traffic laws getting there. So take this.
He hands him a $100 bill. A light that just turned green</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Go through that– The driver blows through it
as it turns re</p>
<p><strong>across the street</strong>: Richardson and McCrady are in
front of a hip cafe arguing.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: I want more red liUhtss–</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: There are too many, ripples in the system..
Cumm.lative effects are. coming into play.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: A traffic jam.</p>
<p><strong>mcc</strong>: That’s even w r. We have to get more localize.
Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: He’s getting out of range!</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ri.ceardson</strong>: Wrong one. .. Two doors down. God, I
hate downtown!</p>
<p>****: I’ve got inflection points. All they have to do is catch sight
of each other this time–</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Is she expecting you? He nods.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I hope you realize how lucky you are. I’m
the friend. Lauren.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Can ’I block the front door?</p>
<p><strong>nccrady</strong>: He’s already through Pit.</p>
<p><strong>richards6n</strong>: The next one!</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: It goes without saying that I’ll kill you if
you hurt her.</p>
<p>****: And by the way, congratulations on your announcement.</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: There are several next ones–</p>
<p>****: I’m blocking them all– His hand stretches out</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Wait, he’s–</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Hat! Hat! McCrady is behind him He points.
at Richardson’s fedora, which is on the sidewalk. Fell off when he ran.
Richardson sprints to grab it–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m in serious trouble here…</p>
<p>****: Forget it! He’s already there… Richardson charges into the
lobby to see David staring through the partially open door to the
rehearsal room…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Dammit ! McCrady’s phone buzzes. He
pulls it out and looks at the caller ID.</p>
<p>****: It’s Mr. Donaldson. Richardson pulls the fedora off his head
and crushes it in his hands. David turns just in time to see this. At
the same time David realizes the door is no longer “stuck.”</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Celebrate while you can. They’ll just
kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you’re up against. David just
looks at him. He’ll deal with that when it comes…</p>
<p><strong>mccrady</strong>: Sir? Richardson grabs the phone and answers
–.going outside to talk. David turns back to the dance studio. He opens
the door to get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches,
dips. David can’t take his eyes off hey` When the artistic director
pauses the routine to give notes, Elise gives David a. little wave. Then
they start again. David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but
he’s gone..</p>
<p><strong>tnt. adjustment bureau headquarters – dusk</strong>: A
defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs.</p>
<p><strong>secretary #1</strong>: He’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re incredible. How did you get that
good?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It’s all I do. It’s the only thing I ever
wante&amp; to be. And I started young.</p>
<p><strong>avid</strong>: How young?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: By third grade I was going every day after
school.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s a lot of motivation for an eight
year-old. She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby
and they exit on to–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: We moved around a lot then. Dance was kind of
my stability.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure… it was the only constant in your life,
aside from your parents…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Really more the dance. She doesn’t make a big
deal of it but we get it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh… David’s phone buzzes. Caller ID shows
it’s Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I take it this is an unauthorized social
break.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m a candidate for the US-:Serrate. I don’t
have to punch out’’when I leave. David sends the call to voice.mai</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Couple houtrs while I’m out of touch
won’t:ill him.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Couple hour, huh? Well, we better make
them,,-,–’count.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: What’s it look like? We see the reflection of
a dance club in the window.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m a terrible dancer. I don’t dance. Elise
climbs out. David follows.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You don’t now. By the end of the night, you
will.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re going to teach me to dance in one
night? Not happening.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Are you doubting me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. She spins and shoves him against the
wall. Forcefully kisses him. Then pulls free.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Don’t. She turns and walks into the club.
David stands there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: The disciplinary rules requ-te me to.
demote you in rank and re-assign yot to a less desirable post. Donaldson
±ingers the document he just signed.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: I’m going-’to interpret those rules
loosely. I’m going to go easy on you because,I feel the deck was stacked
,against you. In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson’s
AIDE sit nearby.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: I’m talking about the intense chemistry
between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker of course:
you pulling them apart only to have “chance” put them back together.
Twice. That seemed impossible. So I asked Burdensky to do some research
this morning, which he just completed.</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: It seems like these two were meant to be
together because they were meant to be together…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>burdensky</strong>: Were, in the past, in an earlier version
of the plan. Actually a dozen earlier versions.</p>
<p>****: God knows how many artifacts pushing them together are left in
the current plan.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Serious, serious.trouble…</p>
<p><strong>moments later</strong>: Salt, Patron, lime .’-.and two
glasses dotin on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Ready? Nope.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Perfect. She yanks him onto the dance
floor.</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: Why was it changed?</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: Something important. They went from
“meant to be together” to “red- letter denied relationship” in a single
Plan revision a few years back. As for why, specifically, that’s
apparently above even my pay grade…</p>
<p><strong>richardson</strong>: You spend your whole career hoping that
one day you’ll get a “red- letter” case. Something you can really make a
name for yourself with. Finally I get one… and it’s. .booby-trapped…</p>
<p><strong>close on the bar’</strong>: Another set of shot glasses hit
the bar. UP to REVEAL David and Elise..</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Okay, we’ve al-ready used up an hour, we
&gt;etter hurry. She pills him toward the exit.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hurry where?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You’ve got to let yourself feel the
music.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve been told I have trouble feeling.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Whoever said that hasn’t seen you speak.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s different. I mean–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: In private. With women AlthOugh that might be
changing. Is there any style of dance you can:’t do?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Next stop, the best 80s club in the city. You
ready?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: To make an ass of myself for the third time
in one night? §4`r, 6’.</p>
<p>****: Race me to that light. You lose, you dance, I watch. You win, I
dance, you watch</p>
<p><strong>david’</strong>: What are’the rules of the race—</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: No rules.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hmmm, could get ugly… He looks down an alley
as if he’s noticed something. When she looks, he takes off like a bat
out of hell–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You bastard! He’s got a good lead, so he
flips around and runs backwards.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Quit complaining and run. She catches up. He
spins and digs it out. He can’t dance, but he sure can run. He pulls
away and wins.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes!!!! He pumps his arms in a victory
dance.</p>
<p>****: That was good. That was very good.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You said “no rules”. She punches him in the
stomach. Hard. He crumples, completely unprepared for it.</p>
<p>****: Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch!</p>
<p>****: You said you had trouble feeling.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: We. need a cab. He’laughing through
the’pain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m serious. You’re a maniac. You should come
with a warning label.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I do. You just can’t see it with my clothes
on. OFF David biting his lip… and PRE-LAPPING the music–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Doesn’t this song make you feel like you’re
at your high school prom?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I was six when it came out. So, not really.
Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls him to the
dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Baby…1-I-I can’t wait–</p>
<p><strong>strobe lights</strong>: As the song kicks in and David and
Elise start dancing… A couple of kids next to them notice David and
start pointing and signaling their approval- The kids who first spotted
David have alerted a few others. More people in the crowd cheer him
on.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson’s aide</strong>: So we’re going operational? This
is exciting. It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>donalds</strong>: We r t no ti go p etational No one
ever.mad&amp; to my job by taking stupit �°ris,s .</p>
<p><strong>’donaldson</strong>: We’re going to kick this case upstairs..
.to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking
into a sweat. We’re going to walk this upstairs to Thompson.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson’s aide</strong>: Thompson? Are we even allowed to
go to him directly? He’s a Senior</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: Exec VP.</p>
<p><strong>donaldson’s aide</strong>: Isn’t he the one.. .when he was in
the field his nickname was–</p>
<p><strong>donaldson</strong>: “The Hammer?” Yes. He’ll crush this
romance with the flick of his hand. And he’ll thank me for giving him
the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>strobe lights</strong>: David and Elise dancing.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Cause I can’t wait,. this .is what I’ve been
waiting for– People on the dance floor are literally screaming in
support.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You grew up over there? She indicatesa
residential area just behind the docks.</p>
<p>****: I spent any, entire childhood three blocks up Carroll Street.
We didn’.t move-` around a lot.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: What were you like as a. kid?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Before sixth grade I spent about half my time
in the principal’s office.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You? Really?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The only person who spent as much time down
there as me was a girl I had a huge crush on so I didn’t mind too
much.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Did your dad work here?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No… My dad filled vending machines.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: And you’re going to be a senator…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: After my brother died my Dad wanted to get me
out of town for a while. We went to Washington and the day we arrived he
took meto the. Capitol. We ended up sitting in the Senate gallery;,all
day. We could see that from the end of my block, but-be never once
encouraged me to go to Wall Street. His idol was JFK. He thought
business guys were selfish.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: So…areyou doing all this-:f.or him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I want to matter. I don’t think that’s just
forrhim. Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I don’t want tonight to mess anything..up for
you, for the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just make sure I make it to Diane Sawyer on
time and I’ll be fine. Elise looks at him for a long beat.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You’re different… somehow you make me
believe…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Believe what?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Just… believe, period.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I don’t let people in, David. And I never let
them in this quickly. David pulls her close., He-,can’t see her eyes.
But we can. She’s struggling with something more…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I haven’::t lead a perfect life</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I. don’t want perfect.,.</p>
<p><strong>elise. ,</strong>: : I’m trying to say .I’m not sure somebody
running. for office can have, me in their life. David turns her around
so he can see her face, so he knows for sure she hears this:</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I haven’t stopped thinking about you since
the moment I met you. I want you in my life–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: There are skeletons in my closet, David. The
kind that–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen to me–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: The kind that people use against–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Elise, listen! I don’t care. We’ll work it
out… I’ve spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of
people to fill the empty space inside me. Then I met you…and realized it
doesn’t. She looks at him. He means it.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You scare me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That wasn’t the effect I was going for… She
smiles…then laughs out-loud–</p>
<p><strong>same – later</strong>: David and Eliseirsleep peacefully.
REVEAL MR. THOMPSON, late 50s, standing next to the bed in a suit, with
a fedora on.</p>
<p><strong>thom bon</strong>: Let it happen again. 7 Thompson’s aides
seem surprised by the answer.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You been up long?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you wake up in. the middle of the
night?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Slept straight through.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought you never sleep through.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p>****: I told you, you scare me. He kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I won’t hurt you. They kiss more… and then
get swept up by it…</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: They lie in bed, post-coital, drained.
Blissful. Until the phone rings. It’s 6:17 am. Early for a call.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Hello? :Why, are you calling?</p>
<p>****: No…I… . Look, I have to go… She hangs up. David looks at
her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s wrong..</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: That was my , ex. Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh… I didn’t– I guess we hadn’t gotten to
that stuff yet…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: He hasn’t called since we broke up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Three months.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Was it serious?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: We were engaged.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What happened? Complete honesty.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: He left… David can feel this in the pit of
his stomach now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You don’t know me that well yet. You’re still
in the wishful thinking phase.</p>
<p>****: Truth is I should.;-Have left him a long time before he left
me. It was a ,ain’ l relationship. It hurt tb be i-h it every day.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But it was:h’ard to leave.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: H&amp; knew what buttons., tb push.</p>
<p><strong>david `’</strong>: that him? DtTid paints at pica re of Elise
with an attractive man, arms wound each other. lis’e looks surprised,
shocked even, to tY%’e photo on her b okcase. She nods.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: David… . It’s not… It’s over between us.
Completely over…I want to be clear about that. I’m pretty sure yesterday
was the most perfect day I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Me too. David looks at the clock.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have this Diane Sawyer interview.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I know. So did that. They look at each other.
Then David reaches for his clothes–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Can I come? My dress rehearsal’s not until
nine. David’s face lights up.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’m afraid if I let you out of my sight. .
.you know…I might never see you again… A smile creeps across his
face…</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: You’ve overcome enormous obstacles in
your life and risen to-such heights so quickly… People are fascinated by
you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Only people who haven’t spent enough time
with ’ me to know the ’truth.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: As a speaker and politician you’ve
been repeatedly compared to JFK.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: By my campaign manager mostly.</p>
<p>****: You’re the youngest person ever elected to Congress. Which you
celebrated by getting in a bar fight on inauguration night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: With a childhood friend. So I don’t think
that counts. And, truthfully, that’s how we celebrate things we’re I’m
from.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: Let’s just say you have a habit of
getting into the press for…other uniquely human things as well–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: that a euphemism, Diane? She laughs.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: Most politicians…</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: .run aw ay from the embarrassing
things they’ve done Yoti,crack, jokes about them. You embrace, them.
Especially since your.;, concession speech thr ee years ago which
started as a `sstd-up routine and brought tears to my,eyes by the .,end
when you talked about losing Your mother to Lancer and then your older
brother,,Pdt, to an overdose, both whei.you:were only ten years old.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think Americans are tired of electing
automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to
offend anyone. I think they want somebody who doesn’t hide who he is or
what he really believes. I guess I’m hoping they want to elect someone
who’s actually like them.</p>
<p>****: But I could be very wrong about that.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: And if you are?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’d be surprised at the number of underwear
companies that have approached me to be their spokesman. Diane bursts
out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: Unfortunately, we’re out of time.
David Norris, announced his candidacy for US Senate yesterday. Thanks
for stopping by. It goes to commercial.</p>
<p><strong>abc id</strong>: Ma’am, Congressman Norris asked me to give
you a message. We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another
one of Thompson’s aides.</p>
<p><strong>thompson aide #2</strong>: He was just called into a meeting
that he says is urgent. He says he’ll call you later and see you at your
show tonight.</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: They’re saying your girlfriend – can
we call her that? Is this one going to last more than a month?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You can call her that. And yes. Definitely.
David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says: “I want to
go to bed with you.”</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: They’re saying she’s getting a tour of
the control room in studio C. Can somebody take Congressman Norris to
studio C? Thompson’s aide signals David to follow him. David does. They
walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>t hompson’s aide #2</strong>: They said she was here… . Hang
on. David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal. He looks up
to see Thompson’s aide exit through the stage door. It suddenly clicks
for David, and he rushes to the door. Yanks on it. It’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: God dammit!</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts – frantic handheld</strong>: David across the room
tugs on another exit. It’s locked. David pulls a fire alarm. Nothing.
David slams on the door with a two-by-four.</p>
<p><strong>longer cuts – composed dolly shots</strong>: Diane Sawyet
talks about the issue of the day as we pull back and show her. co-hosts
on the couch. Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet
for her company’s dress rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>int studio d – day</strong>: David sits. His tie..loose now.
His jacket off. He glances at his blackberry. the time reads 4:13 pm. He
yells in frustration.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If people could hear you out there it
wouldn’t be a very good soundstage, would it? David turns to see
Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit and fedora.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: My name’s Thompson.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What happened to Free Will?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Who said anything about Free Will? David
stares back at him.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You know, we actually tried Free Will
before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the
Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you’d do on your own. You gave
us the Dark Ages – for five centuries – until finally we: decided we
should come back in.</p>
<p>****: The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of
teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off
again. So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific
Revoluton.:�we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with
reason.,then in 1910 we stepped ba �c again. Within fifty years�you
brought us World War I, the lepre’ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani
capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in
the Cuban Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was taken atthat point that we’
should stop in again before ±ou did _soittething even we Cduldn’t
fix.</p>
<p>****: You on’t have_ Free Will, David, you have the appearance of
Free =Will.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You expect me.’to believe that?</p>
<p>****: You have Free Will over what tie you pick in the morning, or
what beverage to order at lunch. But humanity just isn’t mature enough
to have control over the important things.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If you’re in control of the important things
then you’re incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days
it seems pretty fucked.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: It’s still here. If we’d left things in
your hands, it wouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you trying to keep me from Elise? Or
are you just another lackey who doesn’t really know? Thompson studies
David for a long beat. Then decides it’s time to level with him.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: We put Elise in front of you three years
ago to inspire you to, .g `ve that speech – the speech that pulled you
back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you the front
runner for this coming election. The intervention on Charlie was to
prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going
belly up in the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two major banks down. with
it, arid in , the process making you unelectable. David blinks. Tries
to, process this… : .bAVID Are you s aying you warit me to win this
election?</p>
<p><strong>thomp50n,</strong>: This ‘one and six mom, after it. And t’m
not just talking about `elections’ for Senate. lowly dawns on David what
Thompson is saying…</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You can matter, David. Really matter. What
you wanted your whole life. What your father wanted when he took you to
the Senate gallery when you were ten. What your brother wanted when he
made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn’t be like
him.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop. Don’t tell me this.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Why do you think you have that yearning to
be in front of people. . .and that terrible emptiness when you’re
not?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: David you are meant to change the world.
But that doesn’t happen if you stay with her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why does it matter to you who I love? Some
skeleton of hers `is so bad I won’t get elected? I don’t believe
that!</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: It’s not about her-:..it’s about you, what
being with her does to</p>
<p><strong>david-</strong>: What does that mean?! I’m better with her
than I ever was alone., You just said it. That speech–</p>
<p><strong>1hompson</strong>: Yes. The speech… Put it this wad: in small
doses, Elise was the cure. But in large doses… When you’re
enthralledwith someone she ’ rubs off on you:.</p>
<p><strong>da id</strong>: Stop. Just: stop.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: David, the president can’t be a</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop talking. It’s not working.</p>
<p>****: I’m a politician. I spend my life with professional liars. With
people who decide what they want and then figure out the story they have
to tell to get it.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Why do you refuse to accept what should be
completely obvious by now? You’ve seen what we can do. You can’t doubt
we are who we say we are.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t care who you are. I don’t care who’s
orders you’re following.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You can’t outrun your fate, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who said anything about running.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Maybe we should just reset you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We both know if you could have we wouldn’t be
standing here having this conversation… Thompson stares back. He’s never
dealt with such temerity…</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You fight us, we will take everything from
you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You already did once.’ And I’m still
standing…</p>
<p>****: always knew you were out there. We all do. It’s the one thing
we have in common. Whether we call it God or the Devil or Fate we all
know you’re out there, fucking with us…</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You’d still be living in caves if it
weren’t for us.</p>
<p>****: You crush our dreams because they don’t fit with your Plan.
Your Plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room
for Tsunamis and cyclones and Darfur and AIDS. Fuck your plan. I reject
it. I reject you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The only thing we have in this fucked up
world are the choices we make. And there’s nothing you can do to me that
will get me sign them away.</p>
<p>****: Kill me. Or erase me. Or let me go. Thompson stares back at
him, dumbfounded. A long silence,</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: It’s 6:20. If you leave now, you’ll make
Elise’s show. David’s eyebrows go up. Huh? Thompson is letting him
go?</p>
<p><strong>t-4 mpson</strong>: She’s a beautiful dancer.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: There’s one more piece to all this I
haven’t told you. I guess I didn’t have the heart. If you stay with her,
it doesn’t just kill your dreams, it kills hers.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Elise is about to become one of the most
famous dancers in the country… and eventually one of the greatest
choreographers in the world.</p>
<p>****: If she stays with you… she ends up teaching dance to eight
year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t believe you. I thought we already
established that. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: When you look back at all this, David,
just remember, we tried to reason with you. Thompson gets up and
leaves…just as the lights go down for the next dance. David watches him
go…then turns around just in time to catch Elise’s entrance into the
dance – a graceful jump. When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she
falls. The audience gasps.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to
normal.</p>
<p><strong>find thompson</strong>: His hand slightly outstretched. THE
AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong. David jumps up and runs
down to the.: stage door. A dancer comes from off stage and helps Elise
off the floor as the show continues.</p>
<p><strong>int back stage – night</strong>: .A company staff member is
examining Elise’s ankle while the show goes on. David arrives. Sees
Elise’s face. Tears streaming down her cheeks. Seeing David…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: If it’s broken…my career’s over.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t say that. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: I always hear people saying “you yourself
for what can’t bla M4’ hpens fih other people,” but in this case,
really, you can. David stands up… . and punnhesThompson in `the face. h
T ompson is knocked onto his ass. People in the waiting room stare at
David. Almost everyone here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to
summon his usual wit.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: This is what you do, David.</p>
<p>****: This is what you did the first night you got elected. This is
what you did at that college reunion. We give you opportunities people
would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn’t take a
genius to see Elise isn’t exactly going to help you with that.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You want to know why you can’t have her?
Look in the mirror. Thompson leaves.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: How bad is it? The surgeon turns to her with
a classic doctor’s detachment:</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You’re an educated man. You’ve read the
Greek tragedies`. In the end Fate always wins… David looks back at him
in steely silence.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: It a sprain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: This time.</p>
<p>****: Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she’s ever
cared about? You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like… The
thought makes David ill.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Walk away. If you truly love her, walk
away. She’ll hate you for it…but that way she’ll be able to let you go
quickly. You can give her that at least.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It’s a sprain! It’s just a sprain! David
gives her a tight hug.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It’s going to be okay. The doctor said it
would heal in’ a month. . .maybe even less.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re going to: be fine.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: They want to do an MRI…to assess the
ligament. damage but.: -. They break from them hug.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s; going to be fine. And as incredible of
a dancer as you already are, yot’re just going to get better and better…
DavidV;embraces her again, so she won’t see the tears welling in his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I…I have to go make a few calls. His voice
cracks. Elise notices.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m just…happy for you…</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You’re doing the right thing, David. Not
just for her, and the world. . .but for yourself. David looks at him for
a beat, then turns and walks away into the night.</p>
<p><strong>local news reporter :</strong>: David Norris, who’has spent
the last two days campaigning in the tri-lakes area, got some welcome
news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a sixteen
point lead over his opponent less than.a month before election dg t.
FIND Charlie. He
sits<code>at a booth eating breakfast as he watches TV behind the counter. Charlie glan ces out the window ad we FIND David standing on the back of apickup truck speaking to eighty people in the parking lot.</code>:It’s
Autumn now. So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed. He’s not
as ima ea or passion te.:Hedoesn’t seem to enjoy it as much is he °did
three years ago. Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie’s
table.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>campaign aide</strong>: They still love him… Papers? The aide
hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers, the Times, the
Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>follow david</strong>: As he makes his way, towards the
diner’f-tom the parking lot, shaking handb and allowing his picture to
be taken.</p>
<p><strong>int: diner, upstate new york – day</strong>: David sits down
with Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m started.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m going to show you this because you’d
find out eventually and because I want to be here when you do. Charlie
turns the Arts section around for David to see it. Elise’s photo has a
noticeable impact on David. He glances at the article for a moment. Then
Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: David? David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think I need… I…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Take a day off. Take a couple. We’re
sixteen points up.</p>
<p>****: Even I can’t blow a lead that big.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or
just the tourists? The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar
notice him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for him. He
doesn’t know any of them-but they sure know him.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you here? REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in
a suit and raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I would have come earlier but I had to wait
for the rain. Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision
tree. That’s why we met on a boat last time.</p>
<p>****: I guess I’m here to set the record straight.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>harry-</strong>: Thompson was lying when he said they
couldn’t let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless
side.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why, then? Why do they care so much?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: 8ecause.,..she’s enough, David. If you have
=her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and
ataplause’and dreams of one day becoming p sident… if Harry has:looked
straight into David’s soul.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve watched you a long time. They’re right
to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That’s
important but it can’t be the only thing that matters.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you so different than they are?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could
have been a lot more – and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the
Plan didn’t call for that. This hits David hard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In my job, you implement the Plan…</p>
<p>****: And most of the time.. .you don’t even know why…</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My mom?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That wasn’t me… that wasn’t us at all. David
takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink. Then he offers
the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or
the White House I barely hesitated.</p>
<p><strong>d1 id</strong>: But the trt t i `is after making that choice
I went into a free-fall… Don’t get=me wrong, it killed me to see
Thompson hurt her…but I used it as an excuse. I think I left her more to
save my career than hers.</p>
<p>****: Thompson wasn’t lying. The press is already talking about me as
a future president. I’m phoning in my speeches and I’m still sixteen
points up in the polls.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The public loves you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Before I met Elise that was all that
mattered. Now I hardly notice. She’s all I think about.</p>
<p>****: Do you know where she’s getting married?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and
I’ll walk away.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thompson won’t let you get near that
courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Harry… is she happy?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>dw-id</strong>: I have to get her back.. Harry knows how
unlikely that is.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you help me:� Just help me get to
her…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: tOu coming a mile away.’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What if Icould move as fast as you can?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Teach me about the doors.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The first day, after they caught me, they
carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first.
Eventually I realized it’s how you move around so fast. If you don’t
want to help me because of what they’ll do to you…okay, that’s your
choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn’t the choice be
mine?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you have any idea how complicated it is to
navigate through those doors… how many thousands of permutations there
are in even a simple several block journey?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know, when I do town hall meetings I
usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk,
through’ the door and when I start speaking. But when I’m done with the
speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve seen you do that The rain is supposed to
stop in the nexthou’r. We’re going to need all night to do this. And
we’re going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it.</p>
<p><strong>moments later</strong>: Harry and David stand outside a door
to a dock office at the end of the pier. Harry dons his hat.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Put your hand on my shoulder. And don’t let
go until we’ve crossed the threshold.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are they ever locked?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe if you have a defective hat. They step
through the door and onto–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hurry. Harry runs David to the front dooraf a
brownstone. Opens the door. They move through i into–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re underneath Canal Street, which c as ,,A
canal before rt, was a street. This is the jcity’s’:pumping station for
downtown Manhattan. We’re ten blocks from the courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Floor open?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You okay, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I just feel like being on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Everything still on for tomorrow?
Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.</p>
<p><strong>music begins</strong>: something that recalls the
sensei-pupil scenes in martial arts movies, but at the same time
something fluid and lyrical Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of
lower Manhattan. There are intricate red pen markings all over the
map..</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Lower Manhattan is a nightmare. Layer upon
layer of substrate – that’s what we call the system of doors – has been
added over time. That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here
than it is uptown. And a lot slower. Harry dumps out several hundred
photos of doors, interior and exterior, all below Canal Street.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s go. Harry smiles and hblds,.up a
photograph of.the Manhattan County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your destination. Courtroom Six.</p>
<p><strong>int ` elise’s dice company-’; – night</strong>: The MUSIC
CONTINUES”. SOURCE music here-. Elise dances to it, freestyle. The
fluidity and extension of ballet, but none of its formality or
stiffness.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: North Moore St. Just south of the coffee
shop… Red door. I come out on Broadway, near Leonard St. Harry looks at
a photo of what David just described.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good. Keep going.</p>
<p>****: There’s an alley in front of me. Third door on–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thompson’s there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay …so… I hightail it East-to Lafayette no,
it’s Crosby Street there. INT. DANCE COMPANY – Nit;HT Elise dances.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: one wearing a hat Is. a threat. vv1Le. h e
rea lizes w hat’ = g oin g on , Thompson is gong to pull out all the
stops. H going to get reinforcement Jots of them. I don’t care if u’see
a auv wearing a Yankees ca a”yarmulke, or a bowler, as he’s working for
them.</p>
<p><strong>’david</strong>: Okay, you said he’s right in front of me,
right? Harry nods.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’d knock the Yankees cap off his head and go
through the door before he has a chance to pick it up… A thinsmile forms
on Harry’s face and grows…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good… good… improvisation. We have trouble
with that…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t get cocky. You know ten permutations
out of ten thousand. Get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Harry drilling David with photd’after photo
of Manhattan doors INTERCUT with Elise dancing …until she finally quits
from physical and emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yourbrain can only put so much in at once.
Take- a brreak. Da :} , nods. His eyg6,0s’ to: Harry’ s leather
Planbook. He btio#ts to it – a question: can he look at it., Harry opens
tt up to a page in the middle. David’s eyes look over the impossibly
complex circ$t diagram.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Could I ever learn to read that? Harry shakes
his head. Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No matter how hard I tried?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: For the same reason you can’t breathe
underwater or flap your arms and fly. You’re not built to do it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is that me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Elise. Her decision tree. What it was a few
hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here. David looks at it,
then looks away.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I want to ask you what it says.. .what she’s
thinking.. .bit somehow that feels …wrong.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know what she’s thinkin-g,’David – as
much as you need to know. The rest …well…you’re`built to feel that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: ready to get back to work? Sometl`ing about
that strikes Harry…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your father used to say that. Off David’s
reaction–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The fastest path is getting to the blue door
right off the bat…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But you’re exposed the whole way there. It’s
a lot riskier than leapfrogging through doors–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But if I can make it…I’.Il have caught them
completely bysurprise.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Assuming you make it.</p>
<p><strong>court registrar</strong>: Do you have your license? Adrian
hands her his marriage license.</p>
<p><strong>court registrar</strong>: Is your fiancee here?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Getting out of a cab downstairs. The
registrar glances at the license to make sure it’s in order. Then stamps
it: “Judge Williams, Docket #23”.</p>
<p><strong>court registrar</strong>: Courtroom Six.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You got lucky. It’s raining again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The marriage is scheduled for ten minutes
from now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can’t jump the gun on this,,.. Getting
there too early is almost as bad as getting there too late. Harry looks
at his updated Planbook and consults his watch.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. manhattan county court building – lobby – day</strong>:
Elise and Lauren step into a-polished brass elevator from New York’s
Tammany Hall days. Her look is distant, disconnected. Not what you’re
suppoeed to look like on your wedding day.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It ’,.t time. David breathes a sigh of
relief. Harry takes the hat off h1znrhead wand hands it to -David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going for the blue door.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course… MUSIC CUE .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Run fast.</p>
<p><strong>thompson’s aide</strong>: It was a momentary flash, and given
the weather we can’t be sure, but it looks like Mr. Norris may be–</p>
<p><strong>-thompson</strong>: Do we have a proctor -at the
wedding?!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Hi, honey. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Just a little queasy.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’m not sure. Nervous… I just need a minute
in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Cars! Cars! From here it’s faster in the
cars!</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Where is heribw?!</p>
<p><strong>greenwich street-</strong>: They jump in and the car peels
out, followed by two others.</p>
<p><strong>thompson’s aide</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: What? Thompson’s Aide is speechless as he
stares at his Planbook.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thompson’s aide</strong>: He just went into the substrate…
Off Thompson’s reaction:</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: Docket #22 please come forward The guy
next to Adrian stands up. Adrian: throws a panicked look at Lauren.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: We’re next. Will you check on her?</p>
<p><strong>’dam</strong>: It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>new yorker</strong>: We all have emergencies, pal.</p>
<p>****: Are you David Norris?</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Am I making the biggest mistake of my
life?</p>
<p>****: I can’t answer that question for you, Elise. But I will
say–</p>
<p><strong>elise lauren</strong>: If you have doubts– I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’m just nervous. You haven’t done this yet.
It’s overwhelming…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I’m okay. I’m going to clean up. Tell Adrian
I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Congressman! You left. your–</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: Docket #23 please come forward. Adrian
looks at Lauren. Stands. Motions urgently for Lauren to get Elise from
the bathroom–</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: David?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where is she? Water drips from his clothes
onto the marble floor.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: You want to explain to me–</p>
<p>****: Where is she?!</p>
<p>****: I’ll . explain to her– Lauren points at the 1-adies room. David
nods “thanks” and</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Why are you doing this to me? Just then the
door bursts open. The suspicious man from the</p>
<p><strong>courtroom–</strong>: David elbows him in the face. The man
drops.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: David!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not supposed to be weeping on your
wedding day, Elise. Elise fights the emotion again welling inside.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You were never happy with Adrian. You told me
that. Elise puts her head in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: This is so screwed up. Oh,-God..</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I love you. I know I’ve acted strangely. But,
I love you.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve never felt anything like. this in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: If you care ’so much, why the hell did you
disappear on me in that hospital?</p>
<p><strong>el se</strong>: What are you ha.d1 g from me? Why did you diS
pp`ear ” Again! You fucking bastard! Why? Tears are streaming down her
face.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’ll reset me…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’ll scramble my brain–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: David, stop talking like this! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But at least you’ll know the truth.</p>
<p>****: I saw behind the curtain, Elise. I saw this. He opens up
Harry’s Planbook. Elise sees the intricate “wiring diagrams.” Sees the
lines shift on the page. It startles her.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s not in their “Plan” for us to be
together. So they’re trying to stop us.</p>
<p><strong>thompson’s aide</strong>: Oh myGod… He just revealed us.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Stop talking like a crazy person. Stop making
things up–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They said if we were together they’`d take
dance from you and politic,s,from me. They hurt your ankle that night.
They– The door flies open again. David picks up a trash can and clobbers
the fedora-wearing man who enters. He drops.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Call the Intervention Team! Tell them it’s
a square-one reset!</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Jesus.. .the cops are after you?! David grabs
the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed. Kicks it in so it’s
jammed tight.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s not a cop. He’s one of them. Another
body slams into the door now. But the shield holds it shut.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Who’s “them?” SLAM! SLAM! The door
cracks–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Jesus, David!. What’s going on?! David is
impossibly calm. He puts his hat back on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going to: show you. He takes Elise’s
hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her across the threshold
into–</p>
<p><strong>ext . ;soho – day</strong>: Davidand Elise step? thhgtgh. a
door onto a street in Soho. She stops. Awed. Unable to speak.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on… We need to lose them. David walks
her across the street and picks a door at random,</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The rain slows them down but they can track
us. We have two orthree minutes. Maybe less. Elise is still speechless.
He takes her hand.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The ten year-old in me always mixed up
winning elections with being loved. Then I met` you;,..</p>
<p>****: The thing is, if they’d let me be with you I wouldn’tk have
left politipe. t, just would have beef in it, or. all the right reasons.
David pauses for a moment. He can see this’ so clearly in his head. How
can it notbe right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now you know. Youknota everything. And you
have to leave mitie.</p>
<p>****: They’ll take` dance from you. You saw what they-’did before.
’fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed… but somehow she
pulls herself together to say this:</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not safe with me. If you</p>
<p><strong>don’t leave–</strong>: She puts her finger to his lip.
Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense but, right now I
feel safer than I’ve ever felt before.</p>
<p>****: I’m staying…</p>
<p><strong>aide to-he’“chairman</strong>: Mr. Thompson has made an
emergency request for the Intervention Team.. One of the folio
.::documents is titled “Reset Authorization.”</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Every door? tavid nods…as they walk into
another…</p>
<p><strong>ext stone facade – day</strong>: – exit from a metal door in
a stone facade. PULL BACK to REVEAL that they are standing at the base
of the Statue of Liberty… Elise looks out at the harbor and the city.
Rain pelts her face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who
has just broken her chains…</p>
<p><strong>driver of suburban</strong>: The Intervention Team has
pinpointed an interception point. Thompson circles his finger in the air
to tell his men to saddle up, they’re moving out–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: We can’t keep running forever,. David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If they find us …they’ll take you from
me.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I won’t let..them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’ll take you from here. David touches his
head’.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: No, I won’t let them. She leans,-.over and
kisses hi’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>int t. ?re ’war apartment building – day</strong>: David and
Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Perfect. David picks a door. It’s locked. He
tries another. It’s</p>
<p><strong>one –</strong>: locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise
tries shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re not supposed to be locked! David
hears sounds coming from the building’s central staircase. He looks down
it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: This one’s open! Elise is standing at the
door to the roof. David runs to her and they go up the stairs together
to–</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Kiss me. Tears well in her eyes. And his.</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: Close your eyes and kiss me. He does. And
they kiss in the rain…</p>
<p><strong>elise</strong>: I love you, David Norris.</p>
<p><strong>the chairman</strong>: Hello, David… Good morning, Elise. His
voice is gentle, paternal.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>the chairman</strong>: I think you know. David and Elise
stand in awe’-’as they realize.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You can’t oti{rn Fate… Tft , CHAIRMAN It’s
.more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They’re;in
tension with each other. And pure chance. A beat. David looks back at
him…</p>
<p><strong>th2;.&gt;�hat, rman</strong>: I could control ‘everything.
You’d be ha` 3 ou’ d be puppets. I try to .keep things from getting too
out of control. But that has a cost. Most people go through life like
pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli I apply. They accept the
path they find themselves on. And perform accordingly. But every once in
a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone
who understands that Free Will is a gift most people are too afraid to
use.</p>
<p>****: Which, you see, is partly the point of all this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And all the misery, all the pain…</p>
<p><strong>the chairman</strong>: I sit up there and I watch it and it
hurts me… . but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the
random acts of kindness, the love… If you could see huitan beings
choosing every moment every day to be better thAn’’ I made them, you
would know it’s all worthwhile.</p>
<p>****: Good luck, David. And good luck to you, Elise. You’re
a-beautiful dancer. And so much more… The Chairman turns to his aide,
who we didn’t know was there.</p>
<p><strong>the chairman</strong>: Their case isclosed.</p>
<p><strong>aide to the chairrman</strong>: But, Sir,isn’t this a majtr.
deviation from The Plan? The Chairmen turns to another aide who is
holding a folio open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.</p>
<p><strong>the chairman</strong>: Not anymc3e . David and Elise watc]i
The Chairman walk away, still awed by what=they’ve just experienced. As
He disappears around a corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds
… After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say “what do we
do now?”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe we should go dancing. A smile slowly
spreads across her face …</p>
