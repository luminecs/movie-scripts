<h1 id="v-for-vendetta">v-for-vendetta</h1>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: “Remember, remember, the fifth of November,
the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of now reason why the gunpowder
treason should ever be forgot.”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Those were almost the very first words he
spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred
years ago, in a cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the
Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: He was caught in the cellars with enough
gunpowder to level most of London.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he
hadn’t failed. I wonder if it would have mattered.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I suppose the answer is in the rhyme. More
than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: For in the plot we find more than just a man,
we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what
we must never forget.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: This, then, is the story of that idea, of that
spirit that began with an anarchist’s plot four hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I was born near the end of the millennium, the
year 1997. My father used to say that people were so afraid that the
world was going to end that they were willing it to happen.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t remember much of the century’s turn. I
don’t remember the market crash or the plague or any of the Trafalgar
riots.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I’ve read about them since but I don’t recall
how any of them impacted my life except for the fear. They would hide it
from me, like a secret between them.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: But I could feel it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Of the chaos that seemed to swallow the
beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing I do remember.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Very clearly, I can remember that sound.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: And I remember those boots, black leather that
gleamed bright in the morning sun. I had never seen such boots. All
moving in perfect unison.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: The time has come, London, to return to a
bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been
disparaged and all but forgotten. What this country needs is a leader! A
true leader to remind us of that age. A righteous leader with the
strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done. I give you
that man! I give you our leader! Adam Susan!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It must have seemed so easy to them. They
offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore
order.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: At first, the arrests were political.
Dissidents. Radicals. Liberals.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: When my parents were younger, they had been
activists. They had marched with Labor in the great train strike.</p>
<p><strong>little evey</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My daughter! Don’t take my daughter!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Evey! Evey!</p>
<p><strong>little evey</strong>: Mommy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I never saw them again. Overnight, my life, my
entire world was erased.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It was done so quickly and violently, so
completely, that it began to seem that it had never even existed.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: The homosexuals were next. What God had
started with AIDS had to be finished by man. It was God’s work. That’s
what we were told.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: But once they were gone, there was someone
else. Someone different.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Someone dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: There were those who understood what was
happening, who knew it was wrong but who kept silent.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: And in the vacuum of that silence, order was
imposed.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Order that was like those boots, order that
required rigorous discipline. Order that is exactly the same, where each
single step falls with every step. The order of the many shaped into
one.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Somehow in my heart, I knew it wouldn’t
last.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What they thought they had crushed, the spirit
they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots,
rose up, rose as if from a four hundred year old grave, rose to remind
us all that day.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: Good evening, London. It’s nine o’clock, the
fourth of November in the year 2019 and this is the voice of Fate
broadcasting on 275 and 285 of the medium wave.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: People of London, be advised –</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: – that Braxton and Streathon are quarantine
zones as of today.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: It is suggested that these area be avoided for
reasons of health and safety.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: Good news following the productivity reports
from Herefordshire indicating a possible end to meat rationing starting
mid February.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: Police raided seventeen homes in the
Birmingham area, uncovering what is believed to be a major terrorist
ring.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: Twenty eight people, eight of them women, are
currently in detention awaiting trial.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: And that is the face of London tonight.</p>
<p><strong>fate</strong>: And this is the voice of Fate signing off and
bidding you a pleasant evening.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t know what brought us together that
night. I had never been to that part of Westminster but ever since I’ve
known him, I’ve stopped believing in coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Excuse me? Uh… excuse me, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Would you like… uh, would you like to sleep
with me?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I mean, for money.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That is the clumsiest bit of propositioning
I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is this your first time, darling?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yes, no, I mean for money. But I know what you
want and I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Anything you want, mister. Please, I need the
money. I know I’m young but I promise I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No. You don’t know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Christ, you’re a Fingerman.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 1</strong>: Give the little lady a prize.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 2</strong>: I’ve got something to give her.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 1</strong>: Prostitution is a class H offense. Know
what that means? It means that we get to exercise our own judicial
discretion –</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 2</strong>: And you get to swallow it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, please. It’s my first time. Please
don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 1</strong>: Gosh, fellas, look at those big
innocent eyes. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 3</strong>: Spare the rod, spoil the child.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Please, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 3</strong>: You heard the man, sweetie. This rod’s
for your own good.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm
upon him.”</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 3</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “And fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling,
showed like a rebel’s whore.”</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 1</strong>: We’re police officers, pal.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 4</strong>: We’re with the Finger.</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 3</strong>: So bugger off!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel,
which smoked with bloody execution.”</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 1</strong>: He’s got a knife!</p>
<p><strong>fingerman 3</strong>: Jesus Christ! Don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Who – Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Me? I imagine all manner of names shall be heaped
upon my humble visage but, for now, let us simply say I am the
villain.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: And you would be?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Evey.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Why did you do that? Why did you… help me?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Why indeed?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Almost time.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: For the music.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Music?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes, music. My music. You see. Evey, I am a
performer.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Is that why you’re wearing a mask?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: We all wear masks. Life creates them and forces
us to find the one that fits. Do you know what day it is?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Uh… November fourth.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the
gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder
treason should ever be forgot.”</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Tell me, Evey, what good is an actor that plays
his part to an empty theatre?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Nor do I. That’s why you are here. I need you,
Evey. I need someone to listen.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: To your music?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. Yes, to my music.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Can you hear it? It’s already begun.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I can’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: At first, you have to listen very carefully…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Ahh, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It’s beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now.
Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We have less than two minutes of usable
footage, Leader. It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the
Finger’s vice patrol.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: As you can see, the suspect’s reflex speed
is extraordinary. As is his strength.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Freeze it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m afraid the mask makes retinal
identification impossible.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!</p>
<p><strong>etheridge</strong>: We were able to triangulate the origin of
the fireworks. We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone
surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with
the explosions. All suspect or significant transcripts are being
forwarded to Mr. Almond.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Very good. Mr. Finch, speak for the
Nose.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for
the fireworks. These appear to be individually weighted flares and we
have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites
which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication,
these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making
them impossible to trace. Whoever he is, Leader, he’s good.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Thank you for that professional
annotation.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Very good. Gentlemen, keep me informed of
any further developments. England prevails.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind
me?</p>
<p><strong>almond</strong>: Uh… the Fate computer system, sir?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No. No sir. It’s more than that. This, this
computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable
goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Control, Mr. Almond! Control! The world
around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to
man and man alone to set things right!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Without control, man is nothing more than
any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. Control, Mr. Almond. The
control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years.
Now, do you understand what happened last night?</p>
<p><strong>almond</strong>: We… lost control.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Yes, Mr. Almond. Last night someone did the
unthinkable. Someone hurt us. It is imperative that we act swiftly and
precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by
god, I’ll have yours.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Wait. I’ve lost you.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: No, you haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: A jukebox? Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I saved it. Like everything here.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh, it’s beautiful. I’ve never heard anything
like it.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Of course not. You grew up in their world. Art is
created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you
are told what to think.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: This place is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You’re welcome to stay.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Stay here… with you?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. If you like.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I… I don’t even know your name.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I don’t have a name. But you can call me V.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V? V… I like that.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Good morning, London. This is the voice of
Fate – Damn.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Good morning – ack. Good morning Lond–
Goddammit! Where is my bloody tea?!</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Would someone get his lordship his bloody
tea?</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Lewis, they want this report on the first
hour –</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I know. I know. Damned inconvenient this
entire affair. Fine. Let’s try again.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Good morning, London. It is 6 am, the
fifth of November 2019 and this is the voice of Fate. The new day brings
good news and bright prospects from overseas, where negotiations with
New China are moving in a positive direction. Last night’s scheduled
demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Spokesman for the Interior ministry said
both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the
unsuspecting public. Plans for new landmarks are well underway.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: It’s not our job to believe it, Lewis. Our
job is to tell the people –</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: “Exactly what they tell us.” I Know but do
you think that people will believe it?</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: They will if it’s you that’s telling it to
them. Now let’s try it again.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: … plans for new landmarks are already well
underway.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: “Remember, remember, the fifth of
November…”</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Do you suppose that’s why he did it?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: Sir, who did what, sir?</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Guy Fawkes. He tried to blow up
Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Don’t they teach history in school
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: Sir, we’re both straight military,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 2</strong>: Sir, yes, sir. I was fighting in
Ireland by the time I was sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Yes, of course. My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I love trains. I remember riding the
underground with my father. Shame they shut them all down.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: What the hell’s that!</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: I thought I saw a man jumping onto the
train.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 2</strong>: The train’s doing almost seventy. It
would break his legs.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: You’re right, I… It must have been
rags.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Get off of me!</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 2</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: Lock the car doors.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I have a lighter… somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 2</strong>: I can’t find the lock – wait. Hey
wha–</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard 1</strong>: What’s happening –</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I found it!</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Who are you? What do you want? Money? Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Wait, wait. You’re, you’re the one that
blew the Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: You’re making a mistake. I’m nobody –</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Oh god, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I’ve come to offer you a choice. Commander
Prothero.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: What – What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Commander Prothero.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: That was your title at Larkhill. You remember
Larkhill, don’t you, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Where they sent the undesirables.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Maybe I can help your memory. Let’s see. Larkhill
opened in the summer of 2009. You were appointed it commander. You wore
a uniform in those days. You looked very good in it.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You were a man of many responsibilities. You made
sure Larkhill made all its quotas, especially the oven quotas even
though they required an excessive amount of maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: But there was one task you took to with
exceptional relish. Remember the medical block, Commander? I believe you
called it the funny farm. You were the one that selected the prisoners.
You hand picked each one.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Her.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: You! You’re him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Oh my god! What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You gave us a choice, remember, Commander? You
said we could cooperate with the doctors or…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Hold out your hand.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Oh no, no! Please I was just doing what I
was told!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Of course you were. Now I’m telling you to make a
choice. Either you stick that syringe into your neck or –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I can kill you right now.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Crying doesn’t help, Commander. I remember there
was a woman who had been screaming for two days. You winked at the
doctor and laughed, “All in the name of science.”</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Please, don’t make me do this…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: It’s a difficult choice, isn’t it? Certain death
versus something that might be… worse. But you never know. There is
still a chance. You could survive. Look at me. Now, time’s up,
Commander. Choose.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: I’ll see you in hell.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. I’m quite sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>train man</strong>: This door’s locked!</p>
<p><strong>train man</strong>: Holy Christ!</p>
<p><strong>train man</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>train man</strong>: Good lord! I need a medic here.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Fi… Fi… Fi…</p>
<p><strong>train man 2</strong>: He’s trying to say something.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>train man 1</strong>: Five? Where’s the goddamn medic?</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Room five.</p>
<p><strong>train man 2</strong>: I think he needs a priest.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: What do you make of this, Mr. Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Hmm. It’s a rose. A violet carson, I believe.
Strange.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Strange?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I didn’t think they still existed.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Mr. Finch! Sir!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Sir, they want you at headquarters,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Yes, sir. I’m to transport you
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a
sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I’ll be back as soon
as I can.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Ah, Mr. Finch. I sent for you because what I
have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. What I have to say
cannot leave these four walls. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I believe in a few things, Mr. Finch. I
believe in god. I believe in the destiny of the Nordic race. And I
believe in fascism. The romans invented fascism. They had a symbol for
it; a bundle of twigs bound together. One twig could be broken but a
bundle would prevail. That is the heart and soul of fascism. Strength in
unity. I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Well, I…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: You have in fact expressed your discomfort
in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion,
“unnecessary.” The fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a
prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your
craft, and for what you have done for this country.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It is also because I know you, Finch. I know
what you are. You’re a man like me. A man who understands when they are
given a job what must be done. I understand you, Finch, and that is why
I can trust you.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: This terrorist knows us, Finch. These
attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what
he’s doing, Finch. He knows us all too well.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: You think he’s an insider?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What I think is that this man must be
stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be
placed above suspicion. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: England prevails, Mr. Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: England prevails.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, v, v, v, v.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I hear your summons, my lady. And obey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh, V, you scared me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I was reading the inscription. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: A Latin quotation. A motto. “Vi veri veniversum
vivus vici.” “By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the
universe.”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yes, I suppose you have. This place is the
only universe I have right now.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Does that bother you?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t know. I’m so grateful to you – I just
feel I should help you, you know, the way you’re helping me. I mean,
that’s the deal, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: No deals, Evey. Not unless you want them.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I think I do. Part of me wants to stay here
forever and never have to face what’s going on outside. But that’s not
right. Is it? That’s not taking responsibility. Not conquering my
universe.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I want to help you, V. I want to do something.
Can we make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. I think we can make a deal if you like. I
think I know a way you could help me very soon indeed.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Good. That’s that, then.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, you said that Latin thing was a quote. Who
said it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Nobody you’d have heard of. A German gentleman
named Dr. John Faust.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: He made a deal too.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hello, Rosemary. Derek, how –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Derek!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Darling, how are you? Hello, Rosemary.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s so good to see you. Since this bloody
terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the
office.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, you poor dear.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It comes with the job. How are things in the
Eye, Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, we’ve been working some bugs out of
the new Mark IX fiber optic network, actually –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Conrad, don’t be such a bloody bore. Do
tell us about the terrorist, Derek. Is it true he blew up Big Ben and
the old Bailey?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m afraid so. We’re dealing with a
pathological psychotic in the most extreme case. We’ll catch him though.
I promise.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. Aren’t you
glad you’ve got such a ruthless, implacable brute for a husband,
Rosemary?</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: Yes, well –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Believe me, you’re lucky. You could be struck
with a professional peeping tom like Conrad. England’s highest paid
voyeur, aren’t you darling?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Helen, I think we’d better –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh yes, of course. We have to get back so the
little pervert can watch what the neighbors do after Sunday lunch. He’s
so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ciao!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Goodbye, Helen. Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: She’s a bit hard on him, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Until you’re half the woman of Helen’s
sophistication, I’d keep your little mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Really, just look at the way you dress.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Ah, there they go. My happy and contented
flock. Spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Did you enjoy the sermon today,
Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Very inspiring, your grace. Though the segue
of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious
digression.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Hmm, yes. A trifle purple, I thought.
Still, Fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of
the almighty, miserable sinners that we are?</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: And speaking of sin, I wonder which of the
seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with today.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Perhaps pride, your grace.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: I was thinking of something a little less
ethereal. Has the young lady arrived?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: The agency informed me she’ll be here
directly. However, there was a mixup. It’s not one of the usual girls.
She’s a little older.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Oh dear. Oh dear. Not too old, I
trust?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: They promise me she’s no more than
fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Fifteen, hmm.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Ah well, if Job could bear his
disappointments, I suppose I must have the good grace to bear mine. Show
her in when she arrives.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Yes, your grace.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: The young lady, your grace.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Oh my!</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: And to think I doubted your loveliness for
even an instant. Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. You are a vision. An
angel.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Uh… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Of course, “hate the sin, love the
sinner.” I always say. Take your dress off, please.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Listen – I was kind of hoping –</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: You – You filthy whore!</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: I’ll kill you, you fucking sow.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: What’s this? Who –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Please allow me to introduce myself…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I’m a man of wealth and taste.</p>
<p><strong>lilliman</strong>: Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Shh. It isn’t polite to disturb the dead on their
journey.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: A courtesy I’ll most respectfully extend to his
grace.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Vi veri veniversum vivus vici, Evey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You can’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Death has followed his grace the whole of his
career. Is it any coincidence it has finally followed him here?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, V. I can’t – I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Let us pray.</p>
<p><strong>operator 1</strong>: Bloody hell. Doesn’t anybody fuck with
feeling anymore?</p>
<p><strong>operator 2</strong>: Hey, it’s Sunday. Children’s hour over
at the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>operator 1</strong>: Let’s see what that filthy old pervert
is up to.</p>
<p><strong>operator 1</strong>: What the –</p>
<p><strong>voice 1</strong>: … And I saw a black shape against the
flames. Oh god. It’s you. The man from room five. You’ve come –</p>
<p><strong>voice 2</strong>: To collect what’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>voice 1</strong>: I beg you! I don’t want to die! Please have
mercy!</p>
<p><strong>operator 1</strong>: Get me the Finger. This is an
emergency!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: No prints yet, sir. Just like Prothero.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I want those tapes from the Ear in my office
tonight, Dominic.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Yes, sir. They’re on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Any word from your superior, Mr. Creedy?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Mr. Almond doesn’t seem to be answering his
page, sir. I’m sure he’s in the field.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There you go, baby. Now my baby boy can think
so much clearer. Can’t he?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You have been thinking, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know you have. Ever since this terrorist
appeared.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh jesus, that smile. That smile turns me on
like nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me. Tell me what’s going on in that
ruthless sadistic brain of yours.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Everyone is so worried about the terrorist.
Especially Susan. You know why? Because nobody knows what he’s going to
do.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If I were him, I know what I’d do.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’d blow that fat bastard to kingdom
come.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No. You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There’s an old train line under the New
Government Building. It collapsed when they poured the foundation. You
could haul in enough TNT to launch our Leader’s ass all the way to the
moon.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re serious, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You need to be careful, Helen. Your mouth is
going to get you into trouble one day.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is that the same trouble you love putting in
my mouth?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You never know who might be listening.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know, Derek. You love your country and you
love your party, just like you love your wife.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Derek. I’m sorry. I know I can be a bitch.
But that’s why you’re here, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This is it, isn’t it, Derek? What we’ve been
waiting for. At last, you’ll be rid of Susan. I’ll be rid of Conrad. And
we’ll be free. Free, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Sorry it took so long. The boys had a devil
of a time trying to filter out the background noise.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Background noise?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: The perpetrator apparently turned on the
Bishop’s stereo. Subsequently, a great deal of the tape is useless.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What music did he play?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Beethoven. The fifth, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Da, da, da, dum. That’s code. Morse code.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: For the letter “V”.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Anything on the girl yet?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: No. The agency said somebody claiming to be
Lilliman’s valet canceled his Sunday appointment.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: 23rd Psalm.</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: Though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death…</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: It goes on like that for a while. Fairly
incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part.
Transubstantiation.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: That miracle business when the wafer
transform into the body of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: He made him eat a host.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Yes, listen to this part.</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: … And at the moment this enters your mouth it
becomes the flesh of the savior? Yes… please… And whatever it is made of
now it will become the body of Christ? Yes… yes…</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: I want you to swallow it.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: There’s a couple of funny human noises…</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: And then just Beethoven’s fifth.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: We have got the initial path report back. The
host was full of cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: And do you know what?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: When it reached his abdomen, it was still
cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Do you have a motive?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I mean, was anything taken?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Just lives.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I know it’s too early for your profile but do
you have any initial impressions?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: He’s incredibly powerful. This man’s sternum
was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the
manubrium.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: And he’s resourceful. On that table behind
you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero’s blood
stream.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Bloody hell.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: There were hundreds of different chemicals in
him. From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Perhaps Fate will make something more of all
this. I certainly can’t.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: The Leader finally authorized an uplink for
you? He must be getting nervous.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Quite. Government directed terrorism never
sews healthy ideas into the public. Oh, that reminds me.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Can you tell us anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: We found one in the carriage with Prothero
and this one in the Bishop’s quarters. A violet carson.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I heard that strain had died off. Thought a
botanist might shed some light on it. Delia?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Yes – Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Magic. I’ll drop by tomorrow then.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “There is more behind and inside of V than any of
us had suspected. Not who, but what: what is she?”</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: What’s all this, then, Harper? I get a radio
that a man’s down and in need of assistance?</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: I ain’t gone down yet but I sure do need
some assistance.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Are you flat broke already?</p>
<p><strong>lout</strong>: How’d you sneak away, Creedy? Almond off
buggering that blonde chippy?</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: The one with the tits?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: What I wouldn’t give for a piece of
that.</p>
<p><strong>lout</strong>: She could serve a tray of drinks on those
thingies.</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: I bet you get your chance with her sooner
than later, Creedy, with the way Almond’s crackin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>lout</strong>: Bloody bugger’s losing his marbles.</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: Terrorist or no, if that bastard gives me
another double shift, I’ll stomp his fucking head.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Aye. This nonsense has put a serious strain
on my drinking. I think I was actually sober today.</p>
<p><strong>lout</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>harper</strong>: We need to get a real man of the people in
that director’s position. Like Creedy here.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Well, it’s good to know when the shit hits
the fan who your real friends are.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: Derek –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t want to hear it, Rosemary.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: Derek, please! We can’t carry on like
this.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: You don’t talk to me. You don’t eat with
me. You don’t have sex –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t have to take any crap from you! I
have that fat bastard riding me all day. I don’t want to listen to you,
so shut your fat gob!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And me not wanting to fuck you is obvious.
Take a look at yourself.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get out of my sight. I’m cleaning my gun.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: I got it!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: A connection?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Larkhill Resettlement Camp. Prothero’s and
Lilliman’s employment records show they both help positions there at
similar times.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What about codename V?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Most of Larkhill’s records were destroyed
for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and
operations manual.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: In special case studies, medical research
groups used roman numerals to identify test inmates.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Five is the letter V. Brilliant, Dominic.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: All we need is Larkhill’s employment
records.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Roses.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It’s you, isn’t it? You’ve come to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Oh thank god. Thank god.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Oh bloody hell.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: He’s killed them all? It’s not
possible.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: No, no. I thought I would be, but I’m not.
I’m –</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Relieved.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Oh god, all these years. All this waiting.
And somehow I always knew you’d come back.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: When I saw you that night – the night you
escaped, you were standing against the flames and you looked straight at
me.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I knew then that one day you’d come looking
for me, that you’d find me.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: What – what happened at Larkhill. What we did
– What I did. That terrible knowledge, it’s been with me so long. That I
could do things like that.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: For years, I blamed it on the government, on
the authority I could never stand up to. But living so long with the
knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise. I alone was
accountable.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: There is something wrong with us. With all of
mankind. With me. Something evil that made me enjoy what I did. Some
hideous flaw.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: We deserve to be culled. We deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>rosemary</strong>: Derek? What?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t worry, Rose. I didn’t load it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Almond. What?! Where?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh god, yes! God, thank you!</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: You look lost.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Can I buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No… I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I have to find someone.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Well I didn’t like the looks of you anyway
–</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: All units, all units. Code red. Converge in
Plaistow to apprehend codename V.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: It’s him! We got him!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It’s funny, I was given one of your roses
today. I wasn’t sure you were the terrorist until I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: What a strange coincidence. That I should be
given it today.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: There are no coincidences, Delia. Only the
illusion of coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I have another rose. This one is for you.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Then you are going to kill me now?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I killed you ten minutes ago. While you
slept.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Is there any pain?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: No. No pain.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Can I – Can I see your face again?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It’s beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t move an inch, you bloody bastard.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You didn’t hear me arrive, did you? Didn’t
know we’d rumbled you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s all finished, chummy. All of it. The old
man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know. It’s
yours.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Because you’re standing over there with your
bloody stupid knives and your fancy karate gimmicks –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And I’ve got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Who – Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes, look. Look and tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Horrible! God, it’s horrible!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Delia?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Get an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh no… V?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. You knew the doctor pretty
well?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: We found this on her bureau, sir. It’s
Dr. Surridge’s journal. It covers her years at Larkhill. It might
contain the whole story.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: May 23rd…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Prothero has hand picked my subjects. Four
dozen of them, none of which will be any use to me if I don’t get to
work soon.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: They’re so weak and pathetic I find myself
hating them.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: They don’t fight or struggle. Just stare at
you with weak eyes.</p>
<p><strong>prothero</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: June 9th: Of the original four dozen, over
75% are now deceased. Strangely, no clear patterns have emerged as of
yet.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Batch 5 seems to have no common discernible
effect on any specific group though the men seem slightly more resilient
than the women.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I’m hoping the survivors will provide more
answers or my time here will have gone to waste.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: June 18: And only five left now. Two men and
three women. Which tends to contradict my entry on the 9th.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: The man in room five is a fascinating
case.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Physically, there doesn’t seem to be anything
wrong with him. No cellular anomalies, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Batch five, however, seems to have brought on
some kind of psychotic breakdown. He’s quite insane.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: He has this way of looking through you.
Reverend Lilliman won’t go near him. He claims that it is the devil in
room five. I see him cross himself whenever he passes his door. Still,
there’s something about him…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I’m glad Prothero let room five have a go at
the gardening project. He is quite proficient. Prothero was reluctant to
allow an inmate access to the tool and chemical supply at first but now
the fat toad is delighted. The crop has almost doubled.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: He also grows roses. Beautiful roses.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: December 24th: I was in the mess. It was
about half past ten when we heard the first explosion.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: The ones at the front ran straight into the
gas. It was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: A few of us made it out through the rear
door. You could hear men screaming everywhere. I hate the sound of men
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: In the center of the camp, everything was on
fire. Everyone running in all directions. We had hardly enough time to
get our bearings when the ovens exploded.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It was the man in room rive. I couldn’t have
known. The chemical supplies, grease solvents, ammonia, fertilizer. He’d
been making things with them.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Mustard gas…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: And napalm.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: And in the yard, I saw him. He had the flames
behind him. He was naked.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: He looked at me…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: As if I were an insect. Oh god. As if I were
something mounted on a slide.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: He looked at me.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: That’s the last entry until six months later
when Dr. Surridge is back in London. There is no mention of the man in
room five again. End of story.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Except that it wasn’t the end of the
story.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and
women who were previously stationed at Larkhill met with what were
believed to be accidental deaths. Eventually, only three remained.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: The three he’d been saving until last.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Everyone who worked at Larkhill. Everyone who
could have identified him. You see there are two possible motives here.
Not one.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: The first is revenge. He escapes from
Larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. The whole exercise an
elaborate, chilling vendetta.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: That’s the explanation that I find most
reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he’s finished. It’s over
now.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: The second motive is more sinister. Like I
said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What if he’s just been clearing the
ground?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What if he’s planning something else?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: You see, the diary we found was in full view.
We didn’t have to search for it. He left it there. He wanted us to find
it. He wanted us to know the story. Or…</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: For all we know, the diary could be a
complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it himself.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: He’s playing games with us. He might never
have been at Larkhill at all. Do you see? It could all be another smoke
screen, a false trail, another cover story –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Finch, would you please explain to me
the nature of this meeting?! Because I was under the impression that you
had some information about the terrorist, codename V!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No more questions, understand! I want
answers! I am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers
he likes or his favorite color!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Yes, Leader.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Dismissed. England prevails, Mr. Finch.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Finch, the girl. Do you have anything on
the girl?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No, Leader. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Wake up, cow.</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Tsk. This pathetic whore is the famous Miss
Hammond?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You’ve made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Please. I haven’t done anything –</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: I said shut your hole!</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Do you know why you’re here. Evey
Hammond?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No, please, I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Allow me to be more precise. Did you
participate in the murder of Dr. Delia Surridge?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Did you participate in the murder of
Derek Almond, director of the Finger?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No, I –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Did you participate in the murder of
Bishop Anthony Lilliman?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, I don’t –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Have you ever participated in a
terrorist act against your country?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: What is the identity of codename
V?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You are a lying cunt.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: They were going to rape me, kill me –</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: This board will not tolerate any more
of your lies, Miss Hammond. We have over 120 minutes of audio and
videotape and 75 pages of testimonials from eye witness that identify
you as an accomplice to the terrorist, codename V.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Do you want to know why you’re here?
You are formally being brought up on charges of murder on fourteen
counts and sedition against your Leader and country which brings an
automatic sentence of death.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Please. I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Process the prisoner and return her to
her cell until she is more cooperative.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I read her letter. Hid it. Slept. Woke. They
questioned me. And I read her letter again.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Over and over…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Her name was Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I was born in a rainy burg in Nottingham in
1975. I passed my eleven plus and went to girl’s grammar.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I met my first girlfriend at school. Her
name was Sara. Her wrists. Her wrists were beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I sat in biology class staring at the
pickled rabbit fetus while Mr. Herd said it was an adolescent phase that
people outgrew.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sara did. I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: In 1994, I stopped pretending and took a
girl called Christine home to meet my parents.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: A week later I moved to London to go to
college and study drama. My mother said I broke her heart.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: But it was my integrity that was important.
Is that so selfish? It sells for so little but it’s all we have left in
this place…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It is the very last inch of us…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: But within that inch we are free.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Now Miss Hammond, let us review the
facts.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: You work for codename V. Codename V
killed Delia Surridge and then Derek Almond with your help and that is
why you were found outside her home.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Isn’t that what happened, Miss
Hammond?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No. No, that isn’t true –</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Oh dear, Rossiter?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No, wait!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: London. I was happy in London.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I played Dandini in Cinderella.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The world was strange and rustling with
invisible crowds behind the hot lights and all that breathless
glamour.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Work improved. I got small film roles, then
bigger ones.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: In 2006, I starred in “The Salt Flats.”
That’s where I met Ruth. We fell in love.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Every Valentine’s Day she sent me roses
and, oh god, we had so much. Those were the best three years of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: In 2010, they came.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And after that there were no more
roses…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Not for anybody.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: After the takeover, they started rounding
up the gays. They took Ruth while she was out looking for food.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Why are they so frightened of us?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: They burned her face with cigarettes and
made her give them my name. She signed a statement saying I’d seduced
her.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I didn’t blame her. God, I loved her but I
didn’t blame her.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: But she did.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: She killed herself in her cell. She
couldn’t live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. Oh,
Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: They came for me. They shaved off my hair.
They held my head down a toilet and told lesbian jokes. They brought me
here and pumped me full of chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I can’t feel my tongue. I can’t speak.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It is strange that my life should end in
such a terrible place but for three years I had roses and apologized to
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I shall die here. Every inch of me shall
perish…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Except one.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: An inch. It is small and fragile and it’s
the only thing in the world that’s worth having.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We must never lose it or sell it or give it
away. We must never let them take it from us.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t know who you are but I hope you
escape this place. I hope that the world turns and things get better and
that one day people have roses again.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t know who you are but I love you. I
love you. Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I had come to know every inch of those four
walls in that dark hell and they knew every inch of me. Every inch…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Except one.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: “My name is Evey Hammond. On the 5th
of November 2019, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename V
and then taken against my will to an unknown location.”</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: “Once there, I was systematically
brainwashed by means physical and psychological. I was frequently
subjected to sexual abuse during this period.”</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: “Eventually I was terrorized into
helping him commit the murders of Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge, and
Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of Westminster.”</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: “I, the undersigned, swear that the
above statement is genuine and that it was not signed by means of
intimidation.”</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: We’d like you to sign that for us,
Miss Hammond. Where we’ve put the little cross.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell,
Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six
men.</p>
<p><strong>interrogator</strong>: Then take her out behind the chemical
sheds and shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: It’s time, unless you want to change your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: Sign that statement. You could be out
inside three years. Perhaps they’d find you a job with the Finger.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Thank you but I’d rather die behind the
chemical sheds.</p>
<p><strong>rossiter</strong>: Then there’s nothing left to threaten you
with, is there? You are free.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Welcome home, Evey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You did this… to me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You did this to me!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You – You hit me and – and cut my hair. It was
you. It was just you all this time.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You tortured me. You tortured me –</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, why?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Because I love you, Evey. Because I wanted to set
you free.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Love?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Set me free? Don’t you realize?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Don’t you realize what you did to me? You
nearly drove me mad!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I hate you! Set me free? You put me in a
prison to set me free?!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You were already in a prison. You’ve been in a
prison all your life.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Shut up! I don’t want to hear it. I wasn’t in
a prison. I was happy! I was happy here –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Happiness is the most insidious prison of all,
Evey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: That’s warped! That’s evil and it’s wrong!
What gives you the right to judge? Who are you to say what’s not good
enough?!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You were born in a prison, Evey. I didn’t put you
there. I just showed you the bars. You’ve been in a prison so long, you
no longer believe there’s an outside world.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Shut up! You’re mad! I don’t want to hear
it!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: That’s because you’re afraid, Evey. You’re afraid
because you can feel freedom closing in on you. You’re afraid because
freedom is terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I can’t feel anything! There’s nothing left to
feel! Don’t you understand?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Don’t back away from it, Evey. Part of you
understands the truth even as part pretends not to.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Woman, this is the most important moment in your
life. Don’t run from it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t know what – Oh god – I can’t breathe
–</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Good. You’re almost there. Go closer. Feel the
shape of it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What are you doing to me? I can’t breathe
–</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You were in a cell. They offered you a choice
between the death of your principles and the death of your body.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I feel – I feel like I’m going to burst.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You said you’d rather die. You faced the fear of
your own death and you were calm. Try to feel now what you felt
then.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god – I felt –</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Like an angel –</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, V, I’m so scared. What’s happening to
me?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you
feel is the wind from outside. Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Try to walk. The lift will take us to the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: The roof? Outside?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I – I don’t want to be blindfolded.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: No, Evey. No more blindfolds.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Do you feel it?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Everything’s so – different.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I know. Five years ago, I too stared beneath a
night like this. Naked under a roaring sky.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: The night is yours, Evey. Seize it. Encircle it
within your arms.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Bury it in your heart up to the hilt.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Become transfixed and transfigured –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Forever.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Finch!</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Do you know what this is all about?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No, but I can guess.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: “Remember, remember, the fifth of
November.”</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Oh come on. He’s long gone. He has to be.
He did what he came to do and it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Not for us.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: A year, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I have given you almost a year and you have
given me nothing. Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: Now Adam, there is no one better than
Finch and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. It is that
very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a
reason that Mr. Finch has failed.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I’m saying that perhaps I don’t know you as
well as I thought I did.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Are you asking for my resignation?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No, I am asking for some goddamn
results!</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: It’s not Finch’s fault, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We’ve all been looking. The man simply
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>etheridge</strong>: Vanished.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: He’s gone, Adam. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It’s over, is it? He’s gone. Vanished, you
say?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Transcripts recorded over the last thirty
days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive
context. This is only thirty days!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Is this what you consider,
“disappeared?”</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: For god’s sake, Adam, it’s a stupid
variety show.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers,
and actors of that “stupid variety show” arrested and charged with
sedition.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: You can’t be serious –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Push me, Roger, push me and you’ll find out
how serious I am.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: This, this V is still out there. I can feel
him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the
public. Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon
for the very soul of this country is at stake.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: That is why I am compelled to give each and
every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still
giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party
status and terminate your positions.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you in
private. The rest of you are dismissed. England prevails.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the Finger,
you are the most important member of my cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good
man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above
all, loved his country. I need to know if you are such a man.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Do you love your country, Mr. Creedy?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Oh god, yes!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: “The most important member of my cabinet.”
Yes it is, isn’t it, dear?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Oh, don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I stop when you stop. What did he say
next?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on, Peter, what are you afraid of?
Almond used to tell me everything and you’re twice the man he was.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: He asked me… if I loved my country.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country,
almost as much as you love this…</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Then he asked me to do something… oh,
oh…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Helen, I can’t. I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He told you to frame someone as the
terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: My god?! How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know Adam Susan. Now who was it?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: No way. I can’t tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes you can, honey. You can and you will. You
have to trust me, love. We’re going to help each other.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Helen, please.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look at that face. You see? You’re just
bursting to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now who was it?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: It was… Fi… Fi… FINCH!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: That was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I’ve wanted to do this for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Thank you, V. Thank you for everything you’ve
done for me.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You did it all yourself, Evey. I just provided
the backdrop but the drama was all your own.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It was a good backdrop. I believed it. I
really did. It’s still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn’t real.
That it was just you. Especially the letter.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It is a beautiful letter, V. Every time I read
it I could feel Valerie, almost like she was holding me. I believed in
her most of all. I believed that she loved me and I loved her back.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I feel a bit foolish telling you this. I know
that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: But I didn’t write that letter, Evey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. Valerie Page. She was the woman in room
four.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: She wrote the letter just before she died. I
delivered it to you as it was delivered to me. The words you wept over
were the same words that transformed me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Roses. You grew them for her.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: They’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Evey, do you know what day it is?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Two days before the first day we met.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You remembered.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You’re planning something, aren’t you, V?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You know me too well now.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I’m going to fulfill an old promise.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I’ve never been here before.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes. It is the deepest part of my home. Once you
know it, I should think you’ll know everything.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh, V, it’s lovely. Where on earth did you
find it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: In a way, I suppose it really found me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What’s in these packages?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Gelignite.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What are you going to do with all of it?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I told you. I’m going to finish what was started
four hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Where does this train go?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: This is the old Victoria line but it is blocked,
blocked somewhere between Whitehall and St. James.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Whitehall… V, that’s the New Government
Building.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: But the underground has been shut down for
years. How are you going to make it run without any power?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I just thought I might ask them to turn it on for
me.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Yes, Mr. Creedy?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Everything’s set, sir. No worries.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a story
of treachery and betrayal from the Book of Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>dascombe</strong>: All of London’s waiting. Ready, two. And
here we go –</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Tonight, England’s greatest hero repels
the forces of darkness in a brand new episode.</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Oh, Storm. Save me! Save me!</p>
<p><strong>storm</strong>: You mongrel trash, if you harm her!</p>
<p><strong>mongrel trash</strong>: Look out, de white debil has a laser
lugar!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, what the – ?</p>
<p><strong>heidi</strong>: Oh Storm, hold me. Hold me tight.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I don’t know how you stand that tripe.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Es gooh.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Finch? Finch, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Don’t you see, Dominic?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I’m V.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Fuck all.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Creedy? What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: I’m here to arrest Mr. Finch for acts of
treason and terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: If I were you, boy, I’d shut my hole unless
you want to start explaining why you didn’t say nothing about
Mr. Finch’s secret identity.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Why don’t you just shoot me, Creedy? Wouldn’t
that make everything a lot simpler?</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Yeah, I suppose it would.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Holy Christ! Creedy, you stupid ape! If
Finch is V then tell me who is that?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Good evening, London.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Bloody fuckin’ hell.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I thought it was time we had a little talk.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: He has to be at Jordan tower. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Don’t just stand there! Follow them!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Are you sitting comfortably? Good. Then I’ll
begin.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Damn you! Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Lieutenant, ready my transport. I want every
armed man within a hundred miles at Jordan tower. Now!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Right now, I imagine there are hundreds of
soldiers rushing here to kill me because someone does not want us to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Hush. Turn it up.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: They are afraid that I am going to say the things
that are not supposed to be said. They are afraid that I am going to say
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: The truth is that there is something terribly
wrong with this country, isn’t there? If you look about, you witness
cruelty, injustice and despotism. But what do you do about it? What can
you do?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You are but a single individual. How can you
possible make any difference? Individuals have no power in this modern
world. That is what you’ve been taught because that is what they need
you to believe. But it is not true.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: This is why they are afraid and the reason that I
am here; to remind you that it is individuals who always hold the power.
The real power. Individuals like me. And individuals like you.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I have come to offer you a deal. If you accept, I
will give you a different world. A world without curfews, without
soldiers and surveillance systems. A world that is not run by other men
but that is run by you. I am offering you a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Four hundred years ago, a great citizen made a
most significant contribution to our common culture. It was a
contribution forged in secrecy and stealth although it is best
remembered in noise and bright light.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: To commemorate that glorious night at precisely
the stroke of midnight, the edifice of their world will erupt with
enough sound and fury to shake the earth. All I ask is that you join me
at the gates to watch as the past is erased, the pathway cleared so that
together we can start toward a new day.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I want this man dead! I want him shot on
sight!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: But, you ask, who am I to make such promises? A
fair question but hardly necessary as you know me already. To know me
any more you need only look to a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Truth be told, this wasn’t even my idea, was it?
If you think back, you’ll remember that night, whispering in your
lover’s arms. I became a part of your plan just as you have now become
part of mine. Give me the line of the queen and I’ll give you your
secret dream.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: On the twelfth stroke of the fifth day of the
eleventh month, I hope we shall all meet again.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Until then, I bid you goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Who was it? Who was he?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Roger Dascombe! Of course. Of course! It
makes such perfect sense.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sir, I think there has been a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No! There is no mistake!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: But sir, there are people that say they saw
both the terrorist and Dascombe together –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Who? Who are these people? They must be
detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw
is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the
terrorist and the terrorist is dead!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: But I thought I was the terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Finch, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Since I’m not in jail and since you have
another, even more convenient suspect. I’m guessing the charges have
been dropped.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Be careful, Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I am careful, sir. Always. That is why I
suggest that a search of this building begin immediately.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: The terrorist is dead!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: With all due respect, I disagree and I
believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building
disguised as one of us.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Are you challenging my authority?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No sir, I’m trying to run an investigation
–</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I am trying to run a country! When I tell
you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! If
you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but
to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now, it is imperative for the people of
London to know that they are safe, that the terrorist is dead and
everything is under control.</p>
<p><strong>speakers</strong>: The terrorist is dead. No further threat
exists. Everything is under control.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Bollocks.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Bollocks!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: He’s not dead! It’s all bollocks!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: … if you give me the line of the queen, I’ll give
you your secret dream.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Play it again.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Come on, Finch. We’ve seen it fifty times.
I mean, after what they done to you, I don’t know why we’re even trying
to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I don’t know. For twenty seven years, I’ve
been at this job. Twenty seven years, I’ve done what I’ve been told to
do. Maybe that’s all there is to it. I’m just a dumb old dog. A dumb old
dog that only knows one trick.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: That ain’t it, Finch. It’s more than that.
I know you. It’s something personal with this one.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Maybe. And maybe I’m not ready for a
revolution.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Well, we got less than thirty hours to stop
it.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: We will.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: It’s on the tape. I know it. I can feel it.
He did this for a reason. He needs something.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: The line of the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: But what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Maybe it’s a line from Shakespeare. Or a
book. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: … This wasn’t even my idea, was it?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: But right here. He’s talking to someone.
Someone specific. Someone who knows what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: If you think back, you’ll –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Remember that night, whispering in your lover’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Helen? Helen, why did you want that
tape?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Shut up, Conrad. I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: … now you’ve become a part of mine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How? How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Know what, my love?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Give me the line of the Queen and I’ll give you
your secret dream.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: All right. You have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh no! Not you. Conrad. Not yet. Here you can
have a chocolate. Open up. Open!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Good boy. As for the rest of the box, perhaps
when you’re Leader.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Right now I need something else Conrad. I
need you to use that pretty little brain for me. You know all about the
old underground, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I need to know everything, understand?
Everything.</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: Ready in five, Leader.</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: In four, three…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Good evening London. As Leader of this great
country, I felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once
and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our land has
indeed passed.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, for fuck’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What we have endured this long year was no
accident, no mere coincidence. This was not a simple act of terror
conducted by a singular madman. No, this was a test.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It was not me, nor the Party, nor the
government that was threatened this year. It was our beliefs. Our faith.
I believe that God himself bore witness to our struggle and like Job I
believe that we have been vindicated.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Remember fifth of November!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: How do I know this? Let me read to you where
I found the answer, where I so often find the answer. In the Scripture.
Revelations.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: “If any man have an ear, let him hear.”</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: “He that leadeth into captivity shall go
into captivity; he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the
sword. Here is the patience and faith of the Saints.”</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: “And I beheld another beast coming out of
the Earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a
dragon.”</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: “And he doeth great wonders, so that he
maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of men.”</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: “And he deceiveth them that dwell on the
Earth by the means of those miracles which he had the power to do –”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh, V, turn it off, please.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Of course, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: But how does he know?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. All I know is he does… And I
know what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What is that, V?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: That, Evey, is what I have been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Do you know what I want? I want you just
like this… Bent over that black leather chair…</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: What about Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I told you, I’ll handle Conrad and V will
take care of Susan. The mob will take care of the guard and then… You
can use the Finger to take over.</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: Use the Finger? You mean like this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh… oh… that is vulgar…</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: But you like it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, oh yes, oh you’re a pig, Peter…</p>
<p><strong>creedy</strong>: That I am, misses. But I’m the pig that’s
gonna be running this country.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes and I’m… I’m going to be Eva… Oh Eva…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: “Don’t cry for me Argen… oh Argen… Argen…
tina!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Eighteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Dominic!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Dominic, go home.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: But I’ve still got over three hundred lines
from The Fairy Queen.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Forget it. There’s no more time. You go home
and get some rest. You’re going to need it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: He’s got us, doesn’t he, Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Yes, he does.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now listen to me, Conrad. This is the most
important moment of our lives. Everything I’ve worked and hoped for
comes to this. Susan is a very dangerous man, especially now, that’s why
I need you, Conrad. I need you to be stronger than him. I need you to be
the better man. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If you do this Conrad, and you do it right,
I’m going to turn you from the little man I married into the man of my
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Give it up, old man. You’re not even sure you
want to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Christ! That’s it! It’s got to be it!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Sir, Mr. Heyer is here to see you. Says
it’s urgent. And he’s here with his wife, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: His wife?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Sir, yes, sir – Wait, you can’t go –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Leader, I’m terribly sorry but I absolutely
must speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I have something to tell you, something
important but –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I can tell you and only you. In private.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It is a matter of national security.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now what’s this all about, Mrs. Heyer?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please, forgive me. I’ve been so afraid,
afraid to come here to talk to you. I thought he must know. I was
terrified he knew but I had to come because I knew you were the only one
that can protect me.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Protect you from what?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Come now, Mrs. Heyer.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You won’t let him hurt me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Let who hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: The terrorist is dead.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, how I wanted to believe it, Leader, but I
know it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Because I know who the terrorist is.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Who? Who is it, woman?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s Conrad, Leader. Conrad. My husband is
the terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I saw him, Leader. In the middle of the
night. I heard something. I went to the landing and that’s when I saw
it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That mask. That hideous smiling mask.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: But how did you know it was Heyer?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know, Leader. I know the way a woman
knows.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: But you have no proof?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Proof?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Yes, proof? This is an extremely delicate
situation, Mrs. Heyer. It has been reported that the terrorist is dead.
It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete,
conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: But if you’re right, if Heyer is indeed the
terrorist…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Leader! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Is everything all right? Helen?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done her duty
to her country.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Don’t worry, Mrs. Heyer. You will be taken
care of. I will launch an immediate investigation and I promise, you
will be the first to know when an arrest will be made.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Investigation of what?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Subversion, Mr. Heyer. Your wife was privy
to the dialogue of subversives. That’s all you need to know at this
time. Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: The Heyers are leaving. I need to see
Mr. Creedy at once.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I want you to go straight to your office and
wait for me to call. When I do, I want you to come immediately home.
Understood?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yes, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Conrad, I’m so proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I did it, Helen. I did it, didn’t</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tonight, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I promise you will never forget tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Goodbye, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mr. Heyer! Mr. Heyer!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir, this package arrived for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: Do you know what I want? I want you just like
this… bent over that black leather chair.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: Use the Finger?… You mean like this?… Oh…
That’s vulgar… But you like it?… Yes… oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Is the Leader in?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Yes, but he’s meeting with the Captain
of the Guard.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Mr. Finch, you can’t go in –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Leader, I need as many men the Captain can
spare and I need them right now.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: To capture codename V.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: He’s underground. The old subway. I know
exactly what he’s going to do. If we move quickly, we can be there,
waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Leader, every second we delay…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: There will be no discussion –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: But if Mr. Finch is right –</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I am sick to death of this terrorist being
everywhere and nowhere! I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I
will judge it with my own eyes! Do I make myself clear, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No… no sir.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Good. Captain, mobilize your men.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sir, yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: We’ll find this bloody bastard and we will
finish him.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, what’s going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Change, Evey. That’s all. Just change.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Is it going to be violent?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Yes, I suppose it will.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: But why? Why must is be violent?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Because, Evey, that is the nature of change. She
is a temperamental creature that appears in earnest rarely but, when she
does, she will wear one of two faces. The first face is the destroyer.
It is lamentable but all true change begins with death.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What is the other face, V?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: The other face? She is the true face of change.
The face of the creator. She is the one that remakes the world.
Evey?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yes, V?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: May I ask you for a favor?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: It is a small thing but it would mean a great
deal to me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I’ve never danced before. I’ve thought about it
many times, here in this room, listening to the music. But I’ve always
been alone.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: It would be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Thank you, Evey. You are an excellent dancer.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: All it takes is a little practice.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Alas, I have run out of time.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V? What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Don’t you remember? I have a date tonight,
Evey.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You’re coming back though, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, I won’t let you leave unless you promise me
that you will come back.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Of course, I’ll be back. You don’t think you can
be rid of me now, do you?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Just promise.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man is going
to become an example so that every man, woman, and child in this country
will remember what happens to those who would ever think to stand
against the state.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Captain, I need a gas unit down here with
enough nerve gas to fill every rat-hole in these tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I don’t think that will be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: There are over one hundred of the best
trained soldiers in this country down here. Let him come.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Captain, what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: No sign sir. Repeat, no sign of him.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: They lost him.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: This… this is a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re a coward,
Mr. Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Leader, we have to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: This was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: It was a mistake. This is what he wants. He
knows us, Leader. He knows us too well. We have to get out of here
before it’s too late –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Good evening citizens of London. This is the
voice of Fate. Your fate…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: What trick is this?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Tonight, the face of London is going to change
and I am going to offer you the chance to change with her. Your Leader
is finished. He will not leave these tunnels alive.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: This is an outrage! I order you not to
listen to this!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: At midnight tonight, the Head will be destroyed
and a new era will begin. You must now decide if you are going to be a
part of that era.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You can choose to stay here and die with your
Leader or you can choose to be free. The decision is yours and yours
alone.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Captain, order all your men to fall back and
secure this position!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Some of you have wives. Some of you have
families. All of you have lives. Consider each of them as you ask
yourself, are they a part of the past, or are they a part of the
future?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Fall back. Fall back and secure the central
platform.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Any man that disobeys this order will be
court marshaled!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Captain! Captain, where are your men?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Goddammit, I will not tolerate this
insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Shot on sight!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You! You! Point position. We’re getting out
of here! Now!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Traitors! You cowards!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I know who you are! I’ll see you hang! Every
last one of you!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Finch? Finch! Finch, goddammit, you can’t
leave me! Don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You are going to die as you ruled –</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Alone.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Damn you! Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Conrad? Is that you? You’re working with
Finch, aren’t you? And Creedy! You’re all in this together!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You, most of all, should know, Leader. You
created me. Without you, I would never be. More than life, Leader, you
gave me purpose.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “He that killeth with the sword, shall be killed
with the sword.”</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Finch! Oh god, Mr. Finch!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Drop the knife.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch. I knew you
wouldn’t desert me. You’re a good man, Finch. A damn good man.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: No, Mr. Susan. No, I’m not. I’m a man who
does his job and does what he’s told. For twenty seven years, that’s all
I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Careful, Mr. Finch. He’s quick as the
devil.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I’ve read Delia’s diary over and over all
year. It sickens me but I am unable to judge her. I am as guilty as
she.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him.
Kill the bastard, Finch.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: I have no excuse. I did what I was told to
do.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Finch, I order you to shoot him! Finch!</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: My job was to find you and catch you. I’ve
done my job. I’ve done it for the last time. I’m tired of it. I’m tired
of it all.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Kill him yourself if you can.</p>
<p><strong>finch</strong>: Thank you, V. And goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Finch.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason
is death.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Are you ready to die?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: The real question is, are you?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Do you really believe you can pick up that
knife before I pull this trigger?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: No. But I don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You see? You cannot kill me. There is no flesh
and blood within this cloak to kill. There is only an idea.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: And ideas are bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Creedy? Creedy, you dumb bastard, you left
your car parked in front.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did I tell you? Creedy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Helen…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Conrad! What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I won, Helen. I did it. I won. I’m the
better man.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We’ve been through a bad patch, Helen. But
now, he’s gone… There’s nothing to come between us…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t touch me! You stupid piece of shit!
You’ve ruined it! I had it all planned perfectly and you’ve ruined
it!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I have to get out of here! I have to get
away!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Helen –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No! Let go! Now!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Conrad, damn you! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, Helen, you’re not leaving me… not this
time… not ever.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, please! Oh god, no! Oh god, please help
me!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No one can help us, Helen. God is dead.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You came back.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Oh god, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Evey…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: It’s too late for that…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: No, don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Evey, listen to me. I’ve not long and there are
things that must be said.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I have done that which I came to do. Now, it is
time for me to rest and with me the past will, at last, find peace.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: But the world, the world is not saved… Do not
think that, when the fires die and the smoke clears, there is no
miracle… there is only a path… upon which they must learn to rule
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yes, they need you, V.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Not me, Evey, not me. I told you I am the
villain. The destroyer… But yes, they will need help…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I kept my promise to you, Evey… Now you must
promise me.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Promise me… you will discover the face under this
mask… but you will never look beneath it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Promise me. Please…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Sweet Eve. Wherever I shall go, I shall always
love you.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: V, you are not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Midnight… Midnight. Eve… Make them remember…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: You’re not going to die, V!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Let me be there, Evey, when it begins… Please,
let me hear the music, one last time… my music…</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I won’t let you die!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I know you won’t… I know…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: My love… Ave Atque vale…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Return to your homes! There is nothing to
see! The terrorist is dead!</p>
<p><strong>rabble rouser 1</strong>: He ain’t dead!</p>
<p><strong>rabble rouser 2</strong>: He’ll be here, just like he
said!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I remember… I remember staring at the mask, at
that smile.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Part of me couldn’t believe he was dead and
maybe that was why. The smile was still the same. It made me want to
tear it off so I could see the face, so I could see that he was
dead.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: But I had promised.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: You will discover the face under this mask but
you will never look beneath it.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I began to try to imagine his face. Of course,
I had long pictured my father behind that smile but I knew in my heart
that V was not my father.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yet every time I pictured another face, any
face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished. V
was more than a face. V was V.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: And then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, I
realized whose face must be beneath that mask. It was the only face that
mattered.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I won’t let you die.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: I know you won’t… I know.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Goodbye, my love.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: “Ave Atque vale.”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I looked it up the next morning.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: “Hail and farewell.”</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: “Make them remember…”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: They will, my love. They will.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: “Remember, remember, the fifth of
November!”</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I have come here tonight to keep a promise. A
promise that is over four hundred years old. Tonight I am here to give
you your freedom!</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Since mankind’s dawn a handful of oppressors
have accepted the responsibility over our lives, responsibility that we
should have accepted ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By
doing nothing, we gave it away.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Tonight, our world will change. Our leaders
will be gone and we must choose what comes next. A return to the chains
of others or lives of our own. A world of the past or one of the
future.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Let us choose carefully, London, and when we
do, let us mark well and remember, remember this fifth of November!</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Let me be there, Evey, when it begins…</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Please let me hear the music… one last time… my
music.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: At first, you have to listen carefully.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: Ah, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: Yes, my love. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I know that there is only one way to repay him
for what he did.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: And I know that that way is going to take a
lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>evey</strong>: I know this like I know the sun will rise
tomorrow and beneath that new sun, our work will begin.</p>
