<h1 id="the-ice-storm">the-ice-storm</h1>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Good morning ladies and gentlemen –</p>
<p><strong>passengers</strong>: What ladies?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: – this train originating at New York’s
Grand Central Station is back in service - next stop will be New Canaan,
Connecticut. New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four,
published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter
weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb.
His son is the result of Richards’ coupling with the earthling Sue
Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and
the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made
young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And that’s what it is to come from a family,
if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other
ones. And that’s what dying is – dying is when your family, which is in
fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge – it’s when the
family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So it’s a paradox – the closer you’re drawn
back in, the further into the void you’re thrown.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Arise and shine, young Hood.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I hope you changed the water in that bong from
last night.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: The water, as you call it, is a special
mixture of amaretto and Ben&amp;Ben blended for just the exact chemical
interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Waste not Master Hood – that was $20 for
the bag.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: almost talking to Man, Francis, you are one
drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want
to be lined up with you and shot, ’cause you’re fucking ripe for
political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Paul, cancel your mental appointments,
baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I gotta get to English class.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Libbets?</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: What Dostoyevsky is saying here is that to
be a Christian is to choose, because you have to choose of your own
choice, but since you can’t choose to be good because that would be too
rational you have to choose to be bad – it’s existential.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Thank you Libbets, that’s a very compelling
summary, but –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I’m also really
a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The
Idiot?</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: The Idiot?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you liked Notes from Underground, you’ll
love The Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Great, thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m in love with Libbets Casey.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yeah, well, you’ve been in love with like
every other girl here, I was wondering when you’d get around to
Libbets.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s beyond mere physical attraction.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: That’s good, because I don’t think Libbets is
capable of the sex act.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Truly? Do speak.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor
little rich girl – I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend
your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her
step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break –
and like they didn’t invite her!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How do you know this shit?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They did it last year too. It’s like
traditional or something. They’ve got this humongoid Park Ave apartment
and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. Aren’t the hugely
wealthy sad?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You think Francis is going to beat me to the
punch here?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show
an interest in, why don’t you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from
him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good thinking Marge.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No more man. I’m about to drop as it is.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Paul, let me enlighten you about something.
You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide,
that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing
number of sexual conquests on the other. I’m off to get laid. See
you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Flame on, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: And remember, with your erogenous zones
lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial
contact with members of the opposite sex – because you drone on like a
motherfucker when you’re stoned.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: – because I’ve been reading Kerouac and
Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and
sleeping wherever, and, of course, with all kinds of people, but when
you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives,
and, uh, these guys didn’t bathe much, I mean they were really filthy,
with like genital crabs, lice, exceptionally strong body odor…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How can you do that man?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sleep all day. I mean, look, it’s already
getting dark outside, and you’re just getting up.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Um, Libbets Casey.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Aha! I could sense the vibe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Am I right or am I right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. You’re not planning –</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade
in arms offering unconditional aid. I’ve been giving this one a lot of
thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach
that higher ground that –</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hood, telephone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t mess with Libbets. I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m fine dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well good. Just confirming. You’ll be on the
3:50 Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well dad, actually I thought I’d take the
morning train on Thanksgiving – got a lot of studying, papers, you know,
lab experiments –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Lab experiments? Right smart guy – Paul, you
know your mother’s gonna be disappointed not to see more of you – In
fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you
should…</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Well, with regard to the questions as to why
Americans feel we were wrong to make the tapes, that is not particularly
surprising. I think that most Americans do not like the idea of taping
conversations and, frankly, it is not something that particularly
appeals to me…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hold on for a second. Wendy, you want-to say hi
to your brother?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Charles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit?
Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I have not touched your sh– Stuff. You
watching this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Watching what?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nixon, doofus! It’s incredible. He should be
shot.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, that’s the president of the goddam United
States you’re talking about, Wendy!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: He’s a liar! father than into the Dean told
him on March 21st about Kalmback and Hunt, all about the payoffs to the
Watergate burglars, so you tell me where the so-called “Dean Report” is,
but you can’t because it doesn’t exist, because he lied about Haldeman
and Erlichman and the April 17 tape, that’s why! Liar!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: No thank you. We should be off.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey Charles. Charles, calm down – I wasn’t in
on it.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Dinner’s on the counter. We’ll be at the
Williams’s – you know the number. Paul. Hi. Is there anything you’ll
want, any particular kind of food or snack or anything we can stock up
on?… You’re all right? … OK. See you next week. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: We must recognize that one excess begets
another, and that the extremes of violence in the 1960s contributed to
the extremes of Watergate…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: His brother came back –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: From where?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh. Are we going to talk about this,
about…?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You should hear. It’s very sad, he was –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It was a benefit for the ACLU or something, and
Harry Reems himself was there –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: The man with the – from Deep Throat?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The very one – something about a first
amendment defense fund – well I believe in it –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Ted took me to see it.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Ted, how romantic.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I have to say, the movie didn’t do much for
me. But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young
college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: – pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like
there’s no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in
line’s piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice
it’s that Reverend Edwards –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The Unitarian? The new one?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah – claims he pulled off Creek Road and
didn’t notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He’s either got his head in the clouds or up
his –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I hear he’s slept with half the women in
his congregation –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Lucky bastard!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hell! – I mean, no problemo there Mikey. Here,
I –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: So fascinating. Do you get free tickets to
the movies, that kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment
stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their
money. It’s –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Don’t be so modest, Ben. It’s a job that
requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You
were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And as usual no one believed me…</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It’s not a bother.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: I insist. Don’t touch them.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: It’s really quite all right.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And to think – they met at a key party of
all things.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: A key party?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You know, it’s a California thing. That
scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when
they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl,
and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out
and go home with whoever’s keys they’ve got. Anyhow that’s how she met
this Rod person or whatever his name is and he’s left his wife and she’s
packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It’s so ironic.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Ironic?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is Rod.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Thank you Janey.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It was lovely!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey Jim, next time you’ve got to fill me in on
whatever it is you’re up to these days.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Stupid! Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Who said so?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I don’t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: – he knows that when the March 24th tape –
you know with Dean, where Dean tells him that there’s a cancer growing
on the presidency –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Who? No way. He’s like a big infected
whitehead wearing jeans. I wouldn’t –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: – shit, it’s my parents.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’d think she’d learn how to cook a chicken,
eh? My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there. I’m
probably going to get whatever that disease – and Jim, how that guy ever
became a millionaire –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hmm. I knew she’d still be up. Watch this –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Dad stop it!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Get to sleep young lady – and I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Fascist!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If I were a fascist I would have sent you to
one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Good-night dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good night kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’re staring at me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wasn’t star–</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’ve been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was
going to ask if she’d come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That shrink – the one you always wanted me to
see? I thought you dropped him.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I did, but – somebody should probably see
her, talk to her… You think she’s ok?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why shouldn’t she be?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then again, why should she be? I mean with us,
with our…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: So maybe you’ll come too?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh not again Elena! If we’ve got problems, why
can’t you just come out and talk about them.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It’s you Ben who needs to talk. I’ve had my
say, and I’m waiting to hear back from you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah but Elena, even you don’t believe all that
“I’m OK. You’re OK” stuff you keep babbling about – you say so yourself.
I’ve been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: – And you haven’t moved out yet. It’s because
you’re too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or
simply make a decision –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Sleep in the study? Please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture
of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities
industry understand and accommodate it? Well – and I hope I’m not out of
bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ,
continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply
wants more. As the vicious circle of higher returns without real
satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in
fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. This is why I suggest
that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at
the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital
appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>shackley</strong>: Brilliant, brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey there Benjie, you’re becoming quite the
in-house philosopher. When do you have time to think up all that stuff –
Shackley sure eats it up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: George, I’m just trying to get a global view of
things – can’t just look at the small picture.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And speaking of which, you have those market
share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey,
you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ben you know that’s your territory - and I
wouldn’t dream to trespass - you’re the expert. Hey, how do you think
Paramount’s gonna do with that Blatty novel, what’s it called? The
Exorcist?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million – no
stars, and no one’s into the horror genre these days anyway. I’m
advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It’s disaster
films that are gonna stay at the top.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little
early today?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Got a meeting uptown.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right o’.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Up the organization! Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’d asked for that double martini about
three hours ago!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Coming right up, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So asking me out for lunch – what prompted
this exceptional event? – Of course I’m paying.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We don’t have to always go to your club,
dad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And why are you still calling me dad? You’re
forty years old already, and –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – Well what am I supposed to call you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s besides the point.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was actually trying to see about getting a
little advice, you know –</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Advice? I’m supposed to be getting the stock
tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know, dah–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Actually it’s not about work, it’s advice about
–</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don’t mean
to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking,
not really talking, but –</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: – Your mother, God bless her, stood by me
for forty-two years – we never once contemplated divorce - I assume
you’re talking here about divorce? The very thought –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I
mean really hated each –</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: – Waiter! Where’s my cobb salad? You want
advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I’d have him go out
into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you
married that woman against my advice –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – What advice? You never –</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s besides the point. The point is if
I’d had any sense in me I’d have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and
that’s the truth, and here it is, 1972 –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – 73</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: – 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a
traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it
over with. I would have if I’d had the chance.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But I – well maybe I love her. Elena.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Christ Ben! Make up your mind and eat your
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came
by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Yes, it was – I ended up –</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No need to make excuses –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: girls gathered in the She said you licked Dave
Brewster’s weenie in the third floor bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: She’s a liar. I wouldn’t touch Dave
Brewster’s dick if you paid me. It’s probably crawling with v.d. after
he put it in her, which he did.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Did anybody hear that?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: It’s been a tremendously transformative year
– maybe a little controversial of course, but we’re breaking down the
old Unitarian barriers –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect
of it – I’ve never been much of a joiner, although I still consider
myself a somewhat religious person –</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Well I of course flatter myself that our
church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion –
at times it’s the disorganization that’s liberating – and of course I’ve
begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic
environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: My daughter. I haven’t been on a bike for
years. When was the last time you rode a bike?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: They say you never forget.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Forget what?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Forget how to ride a bike.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: No, of course you don’t, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Hey Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mikey was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah? See ya.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Bam.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Want some gum?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sure. Twinkie?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: displaying the gum on his I’m chewing.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Did you tell Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Tell Sandy? What?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You didn’t tell him either, did you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is
something I’m supposed to enjoy, and I was on the goddam golf team in
college, so it’s something one would assume I do well – I used to do
well – but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or
plowing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s like farming. I am basically chewing up
large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks,
and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined
the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro,
and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to
humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly –
throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are
the supposed domain of my department –</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Ben–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: You’re boring me. I have a husband. I don’t
particularly feel the need for another.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You have a point there. That’s a very good
point. We’re having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship.
Your needs. My needs. You’re absolutely right.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: You should probably get dressed. The boys
will be home soon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi mom.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Hi Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I saw you on your bike today.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: With Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Mikey Williams?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We were just riding around.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, you looked very – free – when I saw
you.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Weightless almost – as if I were seeing my
own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Mom. Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Wendy, of course. I’m sorry. You must think
I’m ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You’re not a psycho!</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: The people at Silver Meadows aren’t
psychos.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I know. They’re rich drug addicts and
celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: We’ve been through this Wendy James Taylor
was actually at that clinic up near Boston.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don’t want
to believe me –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: They need the money for my band uniform at
school.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I thought you quit the band - I never hear
you practice anymore.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t really need to practice. I just play
a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I’d stay in.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, I’m sure your father and I would love
to hear what you’re playing these days. Maybe after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can’t wait to see how it fits in with all the
other instruments.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: The Halfords have invited us again this
year.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You want to go?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m, uh, going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: So early?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Rough day. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Is that a new aftershave?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Hmm. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Geometry?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Sure, anything but this English.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Why are you so good at math but not in
English?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I’m not good at math. Just geometry.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: It’s like, you know when they say “two
squared”? And you think it means 2 times 2, equals 4? But really they
really mean a square. A square with a side of two. And the area of the
square is four. Like every time you use the word, like squared, or
cubed, it’s really space, it’s not numbers, it’s space. And it’s perfect
space, but only in your head, because you can’t draw a perfect square,
like in the material world, but in your mind, you can have perfect
space. You know?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah. But I just need some help with my
homework.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey guys, I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You were gone?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston, working on
some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very
conductive. How you guys doing? How’s school?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Uh, I dunno. OK I guess.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hmm. Alright!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You really didn’t notice? Man, he’s been gone
for three days.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Good trip?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Jesus, Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sorry honey. Hell, we’ve got to trade this
thing in for a normal bed.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Just be careful.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid
seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Tonight? Jim, he’s been out of it since he
was born.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: In many ways, the church-bound tradition of
the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the
parent-child-adult triad within us all. It’s a primitive set of symbols
for our inner psychology.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’re saying that Christ is the child, and
–</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: – And God the angry parent, and the Spirit
the hope of an integrated adult self.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: All well and good – But tell me again what is
it exactly that you believe in?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You ask what the point is?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Self-realization. Ministering to help people
reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want
you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and
self-realization?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I would say it sounds like you’re trying to
get me into bed.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: If that’s a potential you see yourself
fulfilling… I mean… My, I sound a bit –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn’t
mean to be so rude.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You weren’t. You actually, for some reason,
you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: But not too ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Now you are being rude.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: And you’re still trying to get me into
bed.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind
of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and
Ben at the Halford’s?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I suppose we’ll make an appearance.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the
list?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I believe so Mrs. Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: With the two of you there it will be
positively a revival! I’m off!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I’m afraid she’s something of a gossip,
isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m afraid people around here provide her
with quite a bit to gossip about. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: That I will indeed.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Because of molecules we are connected to the
outside world from our bodies. Like when you smell things, because when
you smell a smell it’s not really a smell, it’s a part of the object
that has come off of it – molecules. So when you smell something bad,
it’s like in a way you’re eating it. This is why you should not really
smell things, in the same way that you don’t eat everything in the world
around you - because as a smell, it gets inside of you. So the next time
you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember
what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s not the taxes I object to. It’s all the
fines and penalties.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn’t
tell anyone, including the IRS, and I’d of certainly liked to have seen
if there was any old stuff –</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It was all junk!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect
you on Thanksgiving. It’s just going to be you this year.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ben, I’m going to Florida. I hate
Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She’s a negro, she
weighs three hundred pounds, and I’ve decided to leave my entire estate
to her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jesus, Benjamin, you’re still as gullible as
ever.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That was a joke? You don’t tell jokes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I thought I’d start trying. If you don’t
mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Thanks again. For the dinner.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Thanks for eating it. I don’t know why I even
pretend I can cook.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I used to know how to cook.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: It’s not like we’re too busy.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m thinking of going back to school.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Social work?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Educated guess.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m that predictable? No, you don’t have to
answer that. It’s just that with the kids almost grown –</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: You don’t have to apologize. I’m too much of
a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out – don’t
mind me.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Thanks for the lift. If the bike’s any
bother–</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: None at all. I’ll leave it in front of your
garage. Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To find yourself in the Negative Zone, as the
Fantastic Four often do, means that all everyday assumptions are
inverted – even the invisible girl herself becomes visible, and so she
loses the last semblance of her power.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Sandy!</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: You little idiotic prick, you could blow
yourself fucking sky high with all this demented crap.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Hey. I’ll take this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You going to tell dad?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Would it matter? And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You know, it’s the whip – the one uncle Frank
got me from Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: It’s not packed with explosives, is it?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Play with the whip.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Oh. Hi Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi Mrs. Williams.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Mikey, have you heard the explosions coming
from the backyard? Do you know what Sandy’s been up to?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Don’t you kids have homework?</p>
<p><strong>mikey and wendy</strong>: Thanksgiving break.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: After you.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Well, you can…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out
there? Your mom was pretty p.o.’d.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: All my model planes.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: The ones you built?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: They were old. And they couldn’t fly anyhow.
I’m going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I’ll
stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess’s English class
and blow it up.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What do you want?! What do you want? Get out!
Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: A person’s body is his temple, Wendy. This
body is your first and last possession. Now as your own parents have
probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us. That’s
why, in Samoa and in other developing nations, adolescents are sent out
into the woods, unarmed, and they don’t come back until they’ve learned
a thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I don’t ever want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Then why’d you come after me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena. I need some help here if this thing’s
gonna defrost by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You all right there?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh. Sure, I – Did you remember to pick up the
cranberry sauce?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Um, yes.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Because you like it on your turkey
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I do. I’m – are you…?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I… I think I am…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know Elena, I’ve been thinking–</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start
talking, you’re going to–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You crying?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m just sad Ben – I mean it was… you were,
but, you know. I just don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Whatever that means Elena – And you complain
about me not communicating… I thought it was –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: No, I didn’t mean to sound negative. It was –
But Ben. What is going to happen with us? Have you –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do
something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I wasn’t accusing you, Ben. It’s just that
we’ve got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the
children.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hell, I know. I – I guess if you want to accuse
me, you’ve got – Oh hell! I’ve got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yikes – I was hoping to wear this thing to the
Halford’s Friday.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: That shirt?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Leave it – I’ll wash it for you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You have to follow me?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I dunno. I –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey there Mikey, how’s business?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Business? Uh, I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m picking up Paul at the station - want to
come?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What you been up to?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So how’s school treating you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Classes?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Grades?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Anyone special? You know…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hnnn.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well it’s good to see you – we miss you around
the house and all, but this St. Peter’s, it’s top of the line, eh?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know Paul, I’ve been thinking, maybe this
is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about – well
–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: About?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all.
Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there’s things happening that
you’re probably old enough… well… For example, on the self-abuse front –
now this is important - it’s not advisable to do it in the shower – it
wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing
it there in any case – and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your
sister’s underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh, Dad –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Holy! Well. If you’re worried about anything,
just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh, dad, you know I’m 16.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All the more reason for this little heart to
heart… great.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a
favor and pretend I never said any of that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Greetings, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How are the parental units functioning these
days?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Dad’s like doing his Up With People routine,
mom hasn’t been saying much.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. Dad seems a little weird.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: May I operate your telephonic apparatus?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Why don’t you use the phone downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Calling an individual, Charles, in New York.
Confirming a social outing for Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Can I come?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s a one-on-one kind of date thing.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Her name’s Libbets.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: The turkey in?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stuffed and baking.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Anyone home?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll be out in a second.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, it’s great we can all be together. And
this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not
here, although we miss him. So let’s do it right and actually, Wendy,
why don’t you say grace. You used to love to say grace, remember.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Dear Lord, thank you for Thanksgiving, and
for letting us white people kill all the Indians…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: … and steal their tribal lands and stuff
ourselves like pigs</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: … while children in Africa and Asia are
napalmed and –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jesus all right enough!</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You
having one?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: In a bit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know, I think Elena might suspect
something.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe it’s all for the better, you know?
Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn’t said anything… has she acted
funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Have I noticed anything? I’m not married to
her Benjamin, you are. I think you’ve probably a better vantage point
from which to observe her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, but, I – I’ve been working a lot lately,
and – No, that’s not it. I guess we’ve just been on the verge of saying
something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the
verge.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Birth control.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right. Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Janey?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Janey?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Water bed! Dig it!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: See, no one’s here. Maybe you want to go to
the basement?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Maybe we can just watch some TV.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: There’s a TV in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if
you want to…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Why did you – with Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You like him? He worships you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Wendy!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I won’t take my pants off. But I’ll touch it.
That’s as far as it goes.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: When worlds collide.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: 4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the hell are you kids doing down here?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What do you think we’re doing, dad?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do I think? I think you’re probably
touching each other. I think you’re touching that reckless jerk-off, for
god’s sake, and I think he’s trying to get into your slacks. I think, at
fourteen years of age, that you’re getting ready to give up your
girlhood –</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you direct a single word at me, Mikey. I
don’t want to hear it. I’ll be speaking with your parents about this
situation very soon. Bet your ass on that, son. Young lady?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Talking to me, dad?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who else would I be talking to? And take that
thing off!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, then forget all this stern dad
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not interested in your smart ass remarks
now, lady. Let’s go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk
home.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, kiddo, don’t worry about it. I really
don’t care that much. I’m just not sure he’s good enough, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean, he’s not serious, he’ll end up living
off Janey and Jim, you watch. It’s just that you develop a sense when
you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won’t, and
sometimes it’s not worth the mess…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Your toes cold?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll carry you up the drive.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Dinner in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You go dry off now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Never guess where I found her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: In the basement over at Janey and Jim’s. With
that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they’re on the floor and he’s
got his trousers down though thank goodness she’s still dressed. Well, I
really let him have it! … and Wendy came home peacefully… Hey, should I
dress for the Halford’s now, or - give me your -</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Up to you. I’d like to go early and leave
pretty soon after that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I get you loud and clear… hey, you look
nice.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: So what were you doing in the Williams’
basement anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left
it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you
know, reading, thought I’d just catch some air. Let’s eat.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one
that was sitting on the dash.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, that one.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stay out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’ll be on the 10:30 train?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: 11:30?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Paul –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ah let the guy have his fun. What’s the name of
this girl with the Park Avenue address?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Libbets. Libbets Casey.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: … and that ends today’s highlight coverage of
the Watergate affair.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No advice from the experts, huh?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think I –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s on your mind? Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It wouldn’t make a pleasant evening, if
that’s what you’re after. I don’t want to talk about it. Stupid mustache
cup.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Don’t be dim.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena, what are you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m not surprised.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen, Elena, if you’re gonna pull that
passive aggressive stuff on me again –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Your unfaithfulness – that’s what I’m trying
to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And
you won’t do me the dignity of being up front about it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Am I unfaithful? Is that what you’re trying to
say?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It’s a starting place.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, what kind of faithfulness are you
after?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: If you’re going to insult me –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What else could I be? What else could I be?
We’re not living in the real world here. You’re living out some fantasy
land from the past, or some advice or something from those
psychoanalysts… there are some hard facts here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s the law of the land… the government, the
world, those two guys on the Yankees… And I’m not having any fun at it,
I can tell you that. I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh lord. You think I’m so dense. And now you
want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to
wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn’t go with those pants at all. You
want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and
make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage
and you’re not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about
this… You don’t really know what this feels like.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels
like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that’s what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Benjamin. That’s supposed to explain it?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: We’re going to the Halford’s. The number’s on
the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.</p>
<p>****: Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I suppose. Why?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Just curious. If there’s a problem, I guess
I’ll just call you there to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: What sort of problems are you planning
exactly?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh I thought I’d steal the station wagon,
drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Just bundle up. It’s supposed to freeze
tonight. We’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Ben, Elena. Wonderful! Wonderful! So wonderful
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Would you care to play? New this year.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Strictly volunteer, of course. You can put your
coats in the library if you like.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh, damn. Uh, I’ve left the –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ve…</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: In the car.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we’ll be right back, Dot.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: This just isn’t the best moment for this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know, I know. I had no idea –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: That this was going to be a key party?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, well, if we’d understood we could have
invented some kind of excuse. A key party – did you see how stuffed that
bowl was already?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think we’re here and we don’t have to stay –
we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Damn it, Ben –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not staying at this party so we can go home
with someone else’s wife. That’s not why we’re here, right? We’re simply
being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’re not going to –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You have some marker, that’s what I think, if
you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you’re going to put
it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get
back to the house I’ll find the two of you in there and Wendy’ll be able
to hear you and Paul will be back and he’ll hear you and I’ll catch you,
that’s what I think. She’ll be swearing and banging against the wall and
I’ll catch –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena, it’s not what you think. It’s not a big
plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don’t know if you want to go over this now,
but it’s just something that comes over me. I don’t feel good about it.
I know I’ve done what I didn’t want to do. I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, I’m really pleased to hear a
confession.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena, you’re just getting wound up to get
wound up.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So
let’s just go to this fiasco if that’s what you want to do. Let’s just
go on in. I’d rather talk to anyone else but you.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh, Dot!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Benjie!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you
to New Canaan?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, it’s the funniest thing. I’ve been
talking to some investors – a little outside venture, you understand,
between you and me – about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam
packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free
from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius
behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about
that!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, hey, isn’t that a one-in-a million
coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make
of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it’s gonna work?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t see how. I think the public’s had its
fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me – disaster pics. And air
hockey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, gonna make a break for the hors
d’oeuvres guy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say,
where’s the wife?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In Rhode Island with the folks. I’m a free
agent tonight.</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Damn right, but where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ,
I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer
shorts, and – and what’s all that about? What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: A prior engagement overcame me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations
that precede your… from before you showed up. One or two, you know,
good-natured encounters, that doesn’t mean I’m… I’m not just some toy
for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the
party, I just did them, that’s all, because I wanted to do them before I
saw Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jimmy? Jimmy? I don’t know how to take this.
And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband
–</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: How you take it isn’t all that interesting to
me, Benjamin. I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just can’t believe you could be so –</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Welcome to the Monkey House has been a
seminal influence on me – hey Benjamin – give it a try? This stuff will
make some sense out of those larger questions.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks for the advice Dave.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Uh, well, what the hey…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good shit.</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Sure is good shit. It’s opiated. I had it in
my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s what?</p>
<p><strong>gorman</strong>: Don’t fret, Benjie, it’s –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Darn it, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>jack moellering</strong>: Take California. They’ve got their
own airline in-state that’s not subject to the fare controls. Compare
Sacramento to L.A. on the controlled airlines and you’ll see what
Friedman is saying – supply and demand, less restriction.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Approaching our final stop, Grand Central
Station.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Libbets Casey, please.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Hood.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Elevator on the right. Eighth floor – she’s
waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Open it Paul!</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Excellent. We were waiting!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our
leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the
Checkers speech stuff.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there?
In the binding like that?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: All will be revealed, baby.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Awesome sleet and rain.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Major.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you
check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: impersonating a TV Moisture! Moisture!</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Beer. In the pantry.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Frankie opens them with his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, it’s a sellable skill.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Hell on the fillings.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Everything’s gonna freeze, the big
freeze.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home
okay?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hood residence.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You’re parents at that party?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. Yours?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You get in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Maybe. Can’t really tell yet.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I’m sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we
don’t have to, you know… unless you really want to.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m going to Silver Meadow, check out the ice
storm… You wanna come.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. OK.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the
molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there’s nothing in the
air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped.
So it’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Reverend Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Perhaps you might find it in your heart to
call me Philip?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’re here… I’m a bit surprised.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of
the sheep.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: I’m going to try hard not to understand the
implications of that simile.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>ted franklin</strong>: I hope those weren’t my keys.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eureka.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Valium. Seconal. Uh, Par-er-goric? Francis
Chamberlain Davenport the Fourth – tonight you sleep the sleep of the
just.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And whence has yon virginal maiden
absconded?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Like into one of the other 20 or so
bathrooms they’ve got in this place.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Pharmaceutical! You are a god.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: to hurry before Libbets One for you and one
for me.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: No candy for me?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Groovy. Young master of the revels, a treat
for our hostess?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, uh, I don’t, it’s really –</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You
copped ’em from her mom’s stash anyway.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Let’s see!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Libbets, you really shouldn’t mix and match,
you know with the beer. I’ll put ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Oh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these expired
like five months ago. You think they’re better aged?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe you should have just a half.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Thanks for the advice dad.</p>
<p><strong>boland</strong>: Benjie, feeling no pain.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>boland</strong>: Hey – check it out. Maria Conrad’s brought
her son. I wish some of the gang had brought their daughters!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: As Werner says, there is nothing to get.
That’s It. When you get that there’s nothing to get. That’s the
training, when you ask yourself, the question, “What is is?”</p>
<p><strong>janey</strong>: Wait, this is the training, where they don’t
let you go to the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That was the hardest part. But I did it. And
you get into some far out shit.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: The foot… the foot… toeclipper man…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess he’s just real exhausted from, you
know, tests and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know Libbets, I really feel, you know,
like a real connection to you –</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Yeah but you don’t even know me really.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you
give off.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s like very positive, and I feel a real
special feeling, because you really –</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: And I have a special feeling too, because I
do. It’s special.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You do? I’m glad. Because I feel for you –</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: And I have a feeling for you too, because
you’re just like – I feel for you like you’re – you’re just like –</p>
<p><strong>paul and libbets</strong>: – like a brother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, you’re not alone with that line.</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath
together?</p>
<p><strong>libbets</strong>: Hah hah you’re funny. A bath. Like a
brother and sister. Oh man, I’m so wasted.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: OK everyone. We have a little business to
attend to now. So everyone who’d like to stay, please gather in the
living room.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: We’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hood residence.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Charles, what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Is this Charles?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And
I was wondering, because I know you’re a very moral person, and –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. I can’t really talk about it. I guess I
better get to the train.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you doing at home on a Friday
night?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I have plans.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Well, what shall the order be, alphabetical? In
order of appearance?</p>
<p><strong>pierce sawyer</strong>: Golf handicap! Lowest handicap does
the honors.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Golf handicap? Ladies, isn’t it up to you?</p>
<p><strong>maria conrad</strong>: Oh I’ll go first, damn it. Let’s just
line up and get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>marie earle</strong>: Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gadd</strong>: Oh, my own husband. Isn’t that against
the rules?</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Try again?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gadd</strong>: Oh, I think not.</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Getting down to the wire!</p>
<p><strong>the group</strong>: Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry… maybe I should… the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>dot</strong>: Right down the hall, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry, I’m sorry. Uh, I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>rob halford</strong>: Actually, we didn’t put our keys in at
all. But you won’t spread it around? It’s my party, and Dot isn’t… hey,
we’re just going to slip upstairs for a while. You folks like a cup of
coffee or something before we go?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Rob, we’ll fix it for ourselves. You two go
and get acquainted. We’ll let ourselves out the front door.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, I have to say I don’t have much faith
that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn’t seem entirely safe,
leaving your car keys around?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Let me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thanks, but – oh, I don’t think so. It’s been
kind of a discouraging evening.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You couldn’t have hoped for much better when
you came up the walk.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Somehow it was different in my imagination when
I thought about it. Actually, I didn’t think about it at all,
really.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You want coffee or something?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, maybe they have one of those filter
jobs in the kitchen –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Look, Elena, the fact that we’re neighbors… you
know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don’t
you think?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: My husband is probably passed out in the
bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I’ve been married to him for 17
years and I don’t have any intention of going in there to get him… so
what I’m proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and
since you are standing here alone, I’m proposing that you and I do what
makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Now don’t make me feel as if I’m being too
forward, OK? If you don’t –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What the hey. Let’s go for a drive.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do
you think it’s all right–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nah, that wasn’t in the contract.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’re going to have to defrost this thing for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Do these seats go back?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That was awful, really awful. I’m so sorry,
Elena.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn’t
believe how rotten. Janey’s sick. She’s unstable, I guess… it’s not the
right time to tell you… but that’s it – it’s like I can’t make her
happy, the boys can’t make her happy, she just doesn’t –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Jim, maybe we should just go. I’ve got to
look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the
city.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, let me make it up to you – I can do
better than that, honestly –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, we can talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s fine. I wouldn’t expect you to see it
any other way.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Maybe you just need – look, can you wait here
a sec, I need to tidy up – just a minute, I’ll be right back. You’ll
wait?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elena.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Ben, I’ve got a ride home. Maybe you should
sleep this one off on the couch here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll drive you –</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Ben.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’re in no condition to drive. We’ll talk
in the morning, OK?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You’ll get some sleep on the couch out
there?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure. I’ll try. And we’ll talk in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: We’ll talk in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Anyone home? Hello.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Just thought I’d stop by.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mike’s out – I think he went to Silver Meadow
to see if you were hanging around there.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Are you his girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Yeah. You?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh shit oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh shit oh shit. C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Check this out. He’s supposed to talk all
kinds of stuff, but he’s like malfunctioned.</p>
<p><strong>g.i. joe</strong>: Mayday! Mayday! Get this message back to
base!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Same thing. Again and again.</p>
<p><strong>g.i. joe</strong>: Mayday! Mayday! Get this message back to
base!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s gonna get a lot colder tonight, I
predict. Probably a blackout. Do you have candles in your house? I know
where the candles are, and I have my own flashlight. Over there. Also, I
know where every emergency exit is on this floor.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: This knot’s called a bowline.</p>
<p><strong>g.i. joe</strong>: Mayday! Mayday!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Let’s hang him.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: If it wasn’t raining we could take him
outside and blow him up.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: He wouldn’t blow up. He’d just get all
mangled or twisted.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well. It looks like someone got to his
private parts before us.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Communist Viet Cong.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: They left it in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Can I get into your bed? With you?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: We – we have to go to the guest room. We
can’t stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don’t worry about them. They’re at that
party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes
about McGovern and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s just – it’s just –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Vodka?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You never tasted the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It feels warm.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: One more shot?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Under the covers.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Get ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: That’s the name for when you wake up and find
this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: They didn’t tell you this stuff yet? What
planet do you live on?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: That’s nice. Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know. How do I know?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t know either. You spin around, when
you lie down.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t think I’m spinning.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You want to come in, get a cup of coffee – warm
up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest
room.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Sure. Maybe coffee.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Phone’s out. I hope the pipe’s –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh well. Why don’t you put on some dry socks –
and we’ve got some rain boots in the guest closet back there. Last room
upstairs – back of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: You should let him sleep.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Where’s dad?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Good morning ladies and gentlemen –</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I don’t like coffee.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: It’ll warm you up.</p>
