<p><strong>whispering voice</strong>: You love your sister? You make any
noise, know what happens?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Old fuck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, my…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Out for a little stroll, Paulie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let go…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What’s with this poncho you got on, huh? This
isn’t yours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I got it off the wall there. There’s a whole
row of them.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: But not for you, Paulie, that’s the thing.
Those are for the staff.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just borrowed it. Don’t see what harm it
does.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s not about harm, it’s about rules. You
probably don’t think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but
that’s just not true.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry if I broke the rules.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You got no business up in those woods anyway,
especially in the rain. What if you fall and bust a hip, huh? Who you
think’s gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here? Me,
that’s who.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What do you do up there, anyway? You’re too
old to go jerk off, so what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing. I just walk, that’s all, I like to
walk!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I saw you coming back, thought you’d like
some tea. Are you coming in?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Dolan and I were…chatting. About the
weather. I think we’re through now.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed your po’
ol’ hand, I’ll tell ’em you’re having senile delusions. Who you think
they’ll believe?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Why we always watch this crap?</p>
<p><strong>elderly lady #1</strong>: It’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Interesting? Bunch’a inbred trailer trash, all
they ever talk about is fucking…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: We should report him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That might just provoke him all the more, make
things worse for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s not everybody he has it in for, Paul.
It’s you. What did you do to provoke him in the first place? Nothing.
He’s just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ellie, please…</p>
<p><strong>elderly ladies</strong>: …no, the Movie Classic channel is
further down…past the Home Shopping…keep going…</p>
<p><strong>elderly lady #2</strong>: Oh! This is wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>fred astaire</strong>: Heaven, I’m in heaven…and my heart
beat so that I can hardly speak…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul…my God…</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s okay…I’ll be okay…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: S’matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo- hoo?
Something nasty happen?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly fine without
your help, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess sometimes the past just catches up
with you, whether you want it to or not. It’s silly.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Was it the film? It was, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I haven’t spoken of these things in a long
time, Ellie. Over sixty years.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul. I’m your friend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I ever tell you I was a prison guard during
the depression?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’ve mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did I mention I was in charge of death row?
That I supervised all the executions?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They usually call death row the Last Mile, but
we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded
limes. We had the electric chair then. Old Sparky, we called it. I’ve
lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize. That was the year
I had the worst urinary infection of my life. That was also the year of
John Coffey, and the two dead girls…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul? Prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Christ. Gimme a minute.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: For a man pissing razor blades.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You should’a took the day off, gone to see
the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: With a new arrival? You know better. Besides,
it’s not as bad as it was. I think it’s clearing up.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: New boy coming in, boss?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Never you mind, Del, you just keep your nose
quietly on your business.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Damn, they’re riding on the axle. What’d
they do, bust the springs?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul? You might wanna reconsider getting in
the cell with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’s enormous.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can’t be bigger than you.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell’s he yelling
about?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Dead man walking!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Dead man walking! Dead man–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Percy, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You sure you wanna be in there with him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Am I gonna have trouble with you, big boy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Percy. They’re moving house over in the
infirmary. Why don’t you go see if they could use some help?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: They got all the men they need.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why don’t you just go make sure? I don’t care
where you go, Percy, as long as it’s not here at this very moment.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Wiped that grin off your shitpoke face,
didn’t I</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Goddamn it, Percy! Get the hell off my
block!</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oww, damn, boss, he done bus’ my fingers for
true…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ll get it looked at, Del, now keep yourself
quiet like I said!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If I let Harry take those chains off you, you
gonna be nice?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your name is John Coffey.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Yes, sir, boss, like the drink, only not
spelt the same.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you can spell, can you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I’m not here, you
can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton…those gentlemen
there. This isn’t like the rest of the prison. It’s a quiet place, we
like to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: It weren’t me making all the noise,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You having a joke on me, John Coffey?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on
you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Do you leave a light on after bedtime?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Because I get a little scared in the dark
sometimes. If it’s a strange place.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s pretty bright in here all night long. We
keep half the lights burning in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Cor’der.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Right out there.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Couldn’t help it, boss. I tried to take it
back, but it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dean, run Delacroix up to the infirmary and
see if his fingers are broken.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Course they’re broken, I heard the damn
bones crack. Goddamn Percy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You hear what he was yelling when we brought
the big dummy in?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison
heard.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You’ll probably have to answer for sending
him off the Mile. He’s gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark
me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll chew that food when I have to. Right now
I wanna hear about the new inmate…aside from how big he is, okay?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Monstrous big. Damn.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Seems meek enough. Looks like they sent us an
imbecile to execute.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what
he done. Here…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …make your blood curdle.</p>
<p><strong>howie</strong>: Papa! Papa, look! The blood!</p>
<p><strong>klaus</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Central! Central, are you on the line? Oh,
God, please, somebody took my little girls…</p>
<p><strong>klaus</strong>: Oh, Lord, this belongs to my Katie…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: John Coffey. Like the drink, only not spelt
the same.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I couldn’t help it. I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I interrupt?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m just about done.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How’s that pretty gal of yours?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Melinda’s not so well, Paul. Not so well at
all. Got laid up with another headache yesterday. Worst one yet. She’s
also developed this weakness in her right hand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Doctor still think it’s migraines?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’ll be taking her up to Indianola next day or
so for some tests. Had X-rays and the like. She is scared to death.
Truth to tell, so am I.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If it’s something they can see with an X-ray,
maybe it’s something they can fix.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: This just came in. D.O.E. on Bitterbuck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You didn’t come all the way down here just to
hand me a D.O.E.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: No. I had an angry call from the state capital
about twenty minutes ago. Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the
block.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m sure you had reason, but like it or not,
the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name
happens to be Percy Wetmore. I need to tell you how this lays out?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like
a schoolroom sissy. He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning
out of sheer petulance? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix’s left
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I didn’t hear that part. I’m sure she didn’t
either.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The man is mean, careless, and stupid. Bad
combination in a place like this. Sooner or later, he’s gonna get
somebody hurt. Or worse.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You and Brutus Howell will make sure that
doesn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Easy enough to say. We can’t watch him every
minute, Hal.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Stick with it. May not be much longer. I have
it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar
Ridge.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The mental hospital?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Administration job. Better pay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then why’s he still here? He could get that
application pushed through…hell, with his connections, he could have any
state job he wants.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell you what I think. I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well, he’ll get his chance then, won’t he?
Maybe then he’ll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime, you’ll keep
the peace.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Thank you, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You give Melinda my love, okay? I bet that
X-ray turns out to be nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, you. Music too loud?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: No. There’s just this big empty spot in the bed
where my husband usually sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He said to tell you he’s having a little
trouble with that tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is that what’s
got you up?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, that. Things.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Things.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Got a new inmate today. Big, simple-minded
fella.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Do I want to hear what he did?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. One sleepless member of this family’s
enough. The things that happen in this world. It’s a wonder God allows
it.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Why don’t you come to bed? I’ve got something
to help you sleep, and you can have all you want.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t I wish. I’ve still got something wrong
with my waterworks, I don’t want to pass it on.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You see Doc Sadler yet?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, because he’ll want me to take sulfa
tablets and I’ll spend the rest of the week puking in every corner of my
office. It’ll run its course all by itself, thank you very much for your
concern.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Poor old guy…</p>
<p><strong>in tight angles</strong>: Copper plugs are cleaned, switches
are oiled, circuits are tested…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul? Dean?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I guess the legislature loosened those
purse-strings enough to hire on a new guard. Look again. He’s right
there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s doing a cell check.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: It ain’t normal for a mouse to come up on
people that way. Maybe it’s rabid.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Oh, my Christ. The big mouse expert. The
Mouse Man. You see it foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I don’t see its mouth at all.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Aw, Brutal, no! We’ll be hip-deep in mice
around here…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I just wanna see what he’ll do. In the
interests of science, like.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: He’s in the damn restraint room. You know he’s
gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice
little nest.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right. Let’s get the damn mouse.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Saw me a mouse go by.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was a dream. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Weren’t no dream. It was a mouse all
right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can’t put anything over on you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dean, watch the door. He tries to get past
you, whack him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Brutal or the mouse?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Har har, Mouse Man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You let him get past you.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No I didn’t, I was here all the time!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Then where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Three grown men. Outsmarted by a mouse.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. That’s the last we’ll see
of him…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You little son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned. There he is, big as
Billy-be-frigged. I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s a goddamn mouse.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Brute said he was in here last night
begging for food, came right up to the desk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My ass. Give him some room, Percy, see what he
does.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Brave little bastard, gotta give him
that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Here, lemme try.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe he’s full.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe he knows you’re just a floater. Gotta
be an E Block regular to feed the E Block mouse, don’cha know…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was just kidding ab–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Percy met your mouse.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: It’s in here somewhere! I’m gonna squish the
little son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Percy, we already tried that–</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What? Whad’ja say?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I said–</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: –uh, knock yourself out. Hope you nail the
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Gosh. Ain’t in there, huh? Don’t that beat
the mousie band?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Percy. You want to think about what you were
doing just now.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I know what I was doing. Trying to get the
mouse. You blind?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You also scared the living crap out of me and
Bill. And them.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: So what? They aren’t in cradle- school, case
you didn’t notice…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We don’t scare ’em any more than we have to,
Percy. They’re under enough strain as it is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Men under strain can snap. Hurt themselves.
Hurt others. That’s why our job is talking, not yelling. You’ll do
better to think of this place like an intensive care ward in a
hospital–</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown
rats in. That’s all. Anybody doesn’t like it can kiss my ass. How’s that
sit?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Try it. You’ll be on the bread lines before
the week is out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We all know who your connections are, Percy…
…but you ever threaten a man on this block again, we’re all gonna have a
go. Job be damned.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Big talk. You done?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Get all this shit back in the restraint room.
You’re cluttering up my Mile.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Saw me a mouse go by.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arlen? Your daughter and her family are
here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s move. I want at least two rehearsals
before he gets back.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Sittin’ down, sittin’ down, rehearsing now!
Everybody settle!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: I’m steppin’ forward, I’m steppin’ forward,
I’m steppin’ forward…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is his head properly shaved?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, it’s dandruffy and it smells.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll take that for a yes. All right, Arlen,
let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: I’m walkin’ the Mile, I’m walkin’ the Mile,
I’m walkin’ the Mile…</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: I’m prayin’, I’m prayin’, I’m prayin’. The
Lord is my shepherd, so on an’ so forth…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Toot, you have to wait till I tell you to
pray. Okay, pray.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Still prayin’, still prayin’…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Paul, we’re not gonna have some Cherokee
medicine man in here whoopin’ and hollerin’ and shaking his dick, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, actually–</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Still prayin’, prayin’, gettin’ right with
Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do it quietly, you old gink!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: As I was saying, I don’t believe they actually
shake their dicks, Harry. Be that as it may, Mr. Bitterbuck is a
Christian, so we got Reverend Schuster coming in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh, he’s good. Fast, too. Doesn’t get ’em
worked up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: On your feet, Toot. You’ve prayed enough for
one day.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Gettin’ to my feet, walkin’ again, walkin’ on
the Green Mile…</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Watch and learn.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Sittin’ down, sittin’ down, takin’ a seat in
Old Sparky’s lap…</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Gettin’ clamped, gettin’ clamped, gettin’–ow,
shit, watch the skin!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Roll on one.</p>
<p><strong>van hay</strong>: “Roll on one” means I turn the generator up
full. You’ll see the lights go brighter in half the prison…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned to
die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good
standing in this state.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Yeah! I want a fried chicken dinner with gravy
on the taters, I want to shit in your hat, and I got to have Mae West
sit on my face, because I am one horny motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shut up, Brutal. That goes for everybody. I
want quiet in here. Toot, another remark like that, I’ll have Van Hay
roll on two for real.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: It was pretty funny.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s why I don’t like it. Tomorrow night
we’re doing this for real. I don’t want somebody remembering a stupid
joke like that and getting going again. Ever try not laughing in church
once something funny gets stuck in your head. Same goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Sorry, Paul. You’re right. Let’s keep going.
Harry…</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What’s with the sponge?</p>
<p><strong>van hay</strong>: You soak it in brine, get it good and wet.
Conducts the electricity directly to the brain, fast like a bullet. You
don’t ever want to throw the switch on a man without that.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall now be
passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with the
state law. God have mercy on your soul. Roll on two.</p>
<p><strong>van hay</strong>: And that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: Now I’m fryin’! Fryin’! Geeaaah! Fryin’ like a
done tom turkey!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: One of the witnesses showed up a day
early.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right, let’s go again and do it right this
time! Get that idiot out of the chair…</p>
<p><strong>bitterbuck</strong>: You think if a man sincerely repents on
what he done wrong, he might get to go back to the time that was
happiest for him and live there forever? Could that be what heaven is
like?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just about believe that very thing.</p>
<p><strong>bitterbuck</strong>: Had me a young wife when I was eighteen.
Spent our first summer in the mountains. Made love every night. She’d
just lie there after, bare-breasted in the firelight, and we’d talk
sometimes till the sun come up. That was my best time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’ll be fine. You’ll do fine.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Roll on two.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Adios, Chief. Drop us a card from hell, let
us know if it’s hot enough.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’s paid what he’s owed. He’s square with
the house again, so keep your goddamn hands off him.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What’s up his ass?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You, Percy. Always you.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You gotta hate the new boy? That the way it
is around here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why not just move on? Go to Briar Ridge. Yeah,
I know about it. Sounds like a good job.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I might take it, too. Soon as you put me out
front.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You heard me. I want Brutal’s spot for the
next execution.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s with you? Seeing a man die isn’t
enough? You gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I wanna be out front, is all. Just one time.
Then you’ll be rid of me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If I say no?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I might just stick around for good, make me a
career of this.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Del?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Delacroix? That you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You are not gonna believe this.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Look! I done tame me dat mouse!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We see that.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Watch dis! Watch what he do!</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Ain’t he sumpthin now? Ain’t Mr. Jingles
smart?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Jingles?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Dat his name. He whisper it in my ear. Cap’n,
can I have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here wi’ me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I notice your English gets better when you
want something.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Wanna see what else he can do? Watch, watch,
watch…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We play fetch?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: He fetch it ever’ time. Smart as hell, ain’t
he? We do da trick again, watch, watch, watch…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Who’s training who here?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: That’s some smart mouse, Del. Like he’s a
circus mouse or something.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: A circus mouse! Dat jus’ what he is, too! A
circus mouse! I get outta here, he make me rich, see if he don’t!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Well, well. Looks like you found yourself a
new friend, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Don’ hurt him, ’kay? ’kay?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: That the one I chased?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, that’s the one. Only Del says his name is
Mr. Jingles.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Del was just asking for a box. He thinks the
mouse will sleep in it, I guess. That he might keep it for a pet. What
do you think?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I think it’ll shit up his nose some night and
run away, but I guess that’s Del’s lookout. We oughtta find a cigar box.
Get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with. That should
do real nice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Man said get a cigar box.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hal? You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yeah. Paul. Close the door.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Uh. So you know. You got a new prisoner coming
in tomorrow. William Wharton. Young kid. Wild as hell, judging from
this…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: …been rambling all over the state last few
years, causing all kinds of trouble. Finally hit big time. Killed three
people in a holdup, including a pregnant woman. Got “Billy the Kid”
tattooed on his left arm…bad news all around…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: They got X-ray pictures of it. It’s the size of
a lemon, they said, and way down deep inside where they can’t operate.
They say she’ll be dead by Christmas. I haven’t told her. I can’t think
how. For the life of me, Paul, I can’t think how to tell my wife she’s
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …oh God…oh God…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To the doctor. I’m going. Today. Just as soon
as we get the new inmate squares away.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Boy’s doped to the gills. Dean, hand me them
clothes…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: William Wharton! Hey! I’m talking to you! Put
these clothes on!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Hellraiser, huh? Looks more like a limp
noodle to me. Hey! Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You been declared competent! Know what that
means? Mean’s you’re gonna ride the lightning, son!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Bzzzzzzzzt-zap! Just like that! How’s it feel
to know you’re gonna die with your knees bent?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: C’mon, Percy, give us a hand.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Don’ look so good, boss. Look like you runnin’
you a fever.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss Edgecomb? Needs ta see you down here,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Got things to tend to just now, John Coffey.
You be still in your cell now, y’hear?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Careful. Careful.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No fair.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Breathe…breathe…that’s it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We thought he was doped. Didn’t we? Didn’t we
all of us think he was doped?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You didn’t ask? I guess that’s not a mistake
you’ll be need to make again anytime soon, is it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Grab his arms! You too, Percy! Percy, goddamn
it, get your feet out of cement and help us out here!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Get Dean looked at right away, make sure he’s
all right.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: What about you? You look about ready to
collapse.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve got the Mile till you all get back. Go on
now.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss? Needs ta see ya down here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is not a good time, John Coffey. Not a
good time at all.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: But I needs ta see ya, boss. I needs ta talk
t’ya.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Closer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m alone here right now, John. Figure this is
close enough.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss, please. I got to whisper in your
ear.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Boss? You know you not s’pose to do dat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mind your business, Del. What do you want,
John Coffey?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just to help.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you…doing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Del, Chrissake, settle down, I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John? John, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What did you do, big boy? What did you do to
me?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I helped it. Didn’t I help it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, but…how?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just took it back, is all. Awful tired now,
boss. Dog tired.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: What dat man do to you? He throw some gris-gris
on you? You look diff’int! Even walk diff’int. Like y’all better!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re imagining thing. Lie down, Del. Get you
some rest.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Hi, honey. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Um…not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: What did the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de- gook
mostly.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Paul? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s it feel like?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I know what it feels like…it feels
great…but…Paul…</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Those must’ve been some pills.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Paul? Not that I’m complaining. But we haven’t
gone four times in one night since we were nineteen. You wanna tell me
just what the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well…thing is…I never actually got to the
doctor yesterday…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Brutal? Listen…I’m thinking of taking the
morning off sick. You cover the fort for me? That’s swell. Thanks. Yeah,
I’m sure I’ll feel better. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You sure you ought to do this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not sure what I’m sure of.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I offer you a cold drink?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, ma’am, a cold drink would be fine. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said I’d find you
at home today. I hope I’m not troubling you.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: That depends, Mr.–?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Edgecomb. I’m the E Block superintendant
at Cold Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: The Green Mile. I’ve heard of it. Lost a few
clients your way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s why I’m here. I’d like to ask you about
one of them.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Which client? Now you got my curiosity
aroused.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John Coffey.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Ah, Coffey. He causing you problems?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, can’t say he is. He doesn’t like the dark.
He cries on occasion. Other than that…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Cries, does he? Well, he’s got a lot to cry
about, I’d say. You know what he did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I read the court transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank you, Missus.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about ready!
Y’all come on up!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What exactly are you trying to find out?
Satisfy my curiosity, I’ll see if I can satisfy yours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve wondered if he ever did anything like
that before.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Why? Has he said anything?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. But a man who does a thing like that has
often developed a taste for it over time. Occurred to me it might be
easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. A man his size, and
colored to boot, can’t be that hard to trace.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You’d think so, but you’d be wrong. Believe
me, we tried. It’s like he dropped out of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How do you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: We’re in a Depression. A third of the
country’s out of work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s…strange, I admit. But there doesn’t seem
to be any real violence in him. I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith. I
deal with ’em day in and day out.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You didn’t come up here to ask me whether he
might have killed before. You came up here to see if I think he did it
at all. That’s it, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: One seldom sees a less ambiguous case. He was
found with the victims in his arms. Blurted out a confession right then
and there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yet you defended him.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Everyone is entitled to a defense.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Kids! Lunch!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Y’all listen to your Momma, now!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Tell you something. You listen close, too,
because it might be something you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: We had us a dog. No particular breed, but
gentle. Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick. Just a sweet mongrel,
you know the kind. In many way, a good mongrel dog is like you negro.
You get to know it, and often you get to love it. It is of no particular
use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you. If you’re
lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different. My wife
and I were not so lucky. Caleb. Come here for a second.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Please, son.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: He has the one eye. I suppose he’s lucky not
to be blind. We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at
least. Right Caleb? Okay, go on in now.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: That dog attacked my boy for no reason. Just
got it into his mind one day. Same with John Coffey. He was sorry
afterwards, of that I have no doubt…but those little girls stayed raped
and murdered nonetheless. Maybe he’s never done it before–my dog never
bit before, but I didn’t concern myself with that. I went out there with
my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry for your trouble.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: I’m as enlightened as the next man,
Mr. Edgecomb. I would not bring back slavery for all the tea in China. I
believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the
race problem. But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he
gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its
mind to do so. Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is. Don’t you doubt it, and
don’t you turn your back on him. You might get away with it once or even
a hundred times…but in the end…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You understand?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: I’m gonna have to tear that old doghouse down
one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, it’s not for you.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oh. Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I’m smelling me some cornbread.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s from my missus. She wanted to thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Thank me for what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know. For helping me.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Helping you with what?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Ohhh. Was your missus pleased?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Several times.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: This all for me?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oh my. John, I can smell it from here. I surely
can.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Can I give some to Del?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s yours, John. You do with it as you
please.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Here’s for Del and Mr. Jingles then.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey! What about me? I’m’a get some too, ain’t
I</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s yours, John. As you please.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Well. Fine. I think I’ll keep the rest,
then.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Courtesy of the gentleman across the way.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oh, John. So very fine of you. So very kind.
Mr. Jingles t’ank you.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: …wel’cm…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey! What about me? Don’t you hold out on me,
ya big dummy nigger!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll keep a civil tongue on my block.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You get that one for free. But that’s the last
one.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s it? Just that little bitty one? Guess
I’ll have to pay out for the rest, huh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren’t it? Oh, the look
on your face!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You believe this? Son of a bitch pissed on
me!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, d’jall like that? I’m currently cooking
some turds t’go with it! Nice soft ones! I’ll have ’em out t’yall
tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ve been looking to clear that room out
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey! Whassit now, movin’ day? Y’all wanna
come in and dust a little? Y’can shine my knob for me while yer at
it!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You can come in here on your legs, but you’ll
go out on your backs, Billy the Kid guarantee ya that. C’mon, fuckstick.
No sneakin’ up on me this time. We’ll go man to man, see who’s the
better fel–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: C’mon, Wild Bill. Little walky walky.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t you call me that! Wild Bill Hickock
wasn’t no range rider! He was just a bushwackin’ John Law! Dumb
sonovabitch sat with his back to the door and kilt by a drunk!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Oh, my suds and body! A history lesson! You
just never know what you’re gonna get when you come to work everyday on
the Green Mile. Thank you, Wild Bill.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, not in there! C’mon now, I’ll be good!
Honest Injun I will! No! No! Ummmmhhhh…urg…ah!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Holy Christ, he’s pitchin’ a fit!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’ll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I learnt my lesson. I’ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Pssss. Hey. Give’ya nickel for that Moon
Pie.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Li’l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss, yassuh,
howdoo you do?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Hope your bags are packed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Moon Pie thing was pretty original. Gotta
give him that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Del, grab your things. Big day for you and
Mr. Jingles.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Whatchoo talkin’ bout?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Important folks heard about your mouse, wanna
see him perform. Not just guards, either. One of them’s a politician all
the way from the state capital, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You fellas comin’?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We got other fish to fry just now, Del, but
you knock ’em for a loop.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You knock ’em for a loop like Mr. Harry
says, Del.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s move along briskly, folks. There’s not
much time.</p>
<p><strong>toot</strong>: I’m sittin’ down, I’m sittin’ down, I’m
sittin’ down.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Been sweepin’ floors here ten years, never had
to wear no damn tie before.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re a V.I.P. today, Earl, so just shut
up.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue au cirque de
mousie!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Roll on two.</p>
<p><strong>van hay</strong>: That’s that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Very good. Very professional.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well?</p>

clap they hands!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Well, that’s just aces. Pop back in your

<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ain’t you sweet. Soft. Like a girl. I druther

<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wharton!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I let ‘im go, I’us just playin’ and I let ‘im

<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Shut up, Del.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You talk about this to anyone, I’ll get you
all fired. I swear that to God.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile.
Always has.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You keep laughing, you French- fried faggot.
You just keep laughing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about Dean? He’s got a little boy would
love a pet mouse, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: How could a boy be trust wid Mr. Jingles? Maybe
forget to feed him. And how he keep up wid his trainin’, just a boy,
n’est-ce pas?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right, I’ll take him.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: T’ank you kindly, merci beaucoup, but you live

foret.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He whisper that in your ear?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: How about Mouseville?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Mouseville?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Tourist attraction down in Florida.
Tallahassee, I think. Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. Tallahassee. Just down the
road apiece from the dog university.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You think they’d take Mr. Jingles? You think
he’s got the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Might. He’s pretty smart.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Hey! What dis Mouseville?</p>

<p><strong>brutal</strong>: …plus they got the Mouseville All-Star

<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Give’m to me. Might still be time.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul, what the hell–</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him, please help
him, s’il vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at the
tail.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I helped Del’s mouse. He a circus mouse.
Goan live in a mouse city down in…down in…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Florida?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss Percy’s bad. He mean. He step on Del’s
mouse. I took it back, though.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Brute, come along with me. You fellas go on
back to you cribbage game.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Don’t start in on me. It was just a mouse.
Never belonged here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The mouse is fine. Just fine. You’re no better
at mouse-killing than anything else around here.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You expect me to believe that? I heard the
goddamn thing crunch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aren’t you glad Mr. Jingles is okay? After all
our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm? Aren’t you
relieved?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What kind of game is this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No game. See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You switched them! You switched them somehow,
you bastards!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for
occasions such as this.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: You’re playing with me, the both of you! Just
who the hell do you think you are–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’re the people you work with, Percy, but not
for long. I want your word.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: My word?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I put you out front for Del, you put in your
transfer to Briar Ridge the very next day.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What if I just call up certain people and
tell them you’re harassing me? Bullying me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go ahead. I promise you’ll leave your share of
blood on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Over a mouse? You think anyone’s gonna give
two shits?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. But four men will swear you stood by while
Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death. About that people will care,
Percy. Even your uncle the governor will care.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Thing like that goes in your work record.
Work record can follow a man around a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I put you out front, you put in your transfer.
That’s the deal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You make a promise to a man, you shake his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eduard Delacroix, will you step forward?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Boss Edgecomb?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, Del?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Don’ let nothin’ happen to Mr. Jingles,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Here, take him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Del. I can’t have a mouse on my shoulder
while…you know.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I’ll take him, boss. Jus’ for now. If Del
don’ mind.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Yeah, you take ‘im, John. Take him til’ dis
foolishment done–bien! After, you take him down to Florida? To dat
Mouseville?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We’ll do it together, most likely. Maybe
take a little vacation time.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: People pay a dime apiece to see him. Two cents
for the kiddies. Ain’t dat right, Boss Howell?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: That’s right, Del.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You a good man, Boss Howell. You too, Boss
Edgecomb. Wish I could’a met you bot’ someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Au revoir, mon ami. Je t’aime, mon petit.</p>
<p><strong>fat lady</strong>: Hope he’s good and scared. Hope he knows
the fires are stoked, and that Satan’s imps are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Roll on one.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You be still, Mr. Jingles. You be so quiet
and so still.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Eduard Delacroix, you have been condemned to
die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good
standing in this state. You have anything to say before sentence is
carried out?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: I sorry for what I do. I give anything to take
it back, but I can’t. God have mercy on me. Don’ forget ’bout
Mouseville.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: No such place. That’s just a fairy tale these
guys told you to keep you quiet. Just thought you should know,
faggot.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Electricity shall now be passed through your
body until you are dead, in accordance with state law. God have mercy on
your soul.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Roll on two.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s dry!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Don’t you tell him to stop. Don’t you do it.
It’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>witnesses</strong>: What the hell’s happening to him?…Are
those clamps going to hold?…Christ, the smell!…Is this normal?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No water! No water! You crazy?</p>
<p><strong>fat lady</strong>: Stop it, stop it, oh can’t you see he’s
had enough?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Why don’t you shut it down?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s still alive! You want me to shut down
while he’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You watch, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kill it!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You do it. You’re running the show, ain’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s all right, folks, it’s all under control.
Just a power surge from the storm, that’s all, nothing to worry
about…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dean, get doc’s stethoscope.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh my God! Is it always like this? Why didn’t
somebody tell me? I never would have come!</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I didn’t know the sponge was supposed to be
wet–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Brutal, no!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: What do you mean, no? How can you say no?
You saw what he did!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Delacroix’s dead, nothing can change that, and
Percy’s not worth it!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: So he just gets away with it? Is that how it
works?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ, three
witnesses puked all over the floor up there! And the smell! I got Van
Hay to open both doors, but that smell won’t come out for five damn
years, that’s what I’m betting! And that asshole Wharton is singing
about it! I can hear him!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can he carry a tune, Hal?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the hell
happened?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Percy? Something to say?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I didn’t know the sponge was supposed to be
wet.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: How many years you spend pissing on the toilet
seat before somebody told you to put it up?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and simple.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Is that your official position?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t you think it should be?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’ll be putting in a transfer request to
Briar Ridge tomorrow. Moving on to bigger and better things. Isn’t that
right, Percy?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You’re a little asshole, and I don’t like you a
bit. Have that transfer request on my desk first thing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Barbecue! Me and you! Stinky, pinky,
phew-phew-phew! Weren’t Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Roy–it was a
French-fried faggot named Delacroix!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re about ten seconds away from spending
the rest of your life in the padded room.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Poor Del. Poor old Del.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Poor old Del. John, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I could feel it from here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean? You could hear it? Is that
what you mean?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: He’s out of it now, though. He’s the lucky
one. No matter how it happened, Del’s the lucky one.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s Mr. Jingles?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Ran down there. Don’t think he’ll be back.
Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Me too, John. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I hate this.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: She’s having one of her good days. I thank God
for that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What a bad day?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Sometimes she’s…not herself anymore. She
swears.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Swears.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It just pops out, the most awful language you
can imagine. She doesn’t even know she’s doing it. I didn’t know she’d
ever heard words like that…and to hear her say them in her sweet voice…
I’m glad she’s having a good day, Paul. I’m glad for you and Jan.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Honey? If you don’t say what’s on your mind,
I’m afraid I’ll have to smother you with a pillow.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m thinking I love you. I’m thinking I don’t
know what I’d do if you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m also thinking I’d like to have the boys
over tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>the men</strong>: Ma’am, you sure know how to fry up some
fine chicken…Brutal, don’t hog the taters now…Try that corn yet? It’s
something special…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You saw what he did with the mouse.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I could’a gone the rest of the day without
you bringing that up.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I could’a gone the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He did it to me too. He put his hands on me
and took my bladder infection away.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: When he came home, he was…all better.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re talking about an authentic healing. A
praise-Jesus miracle.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: If you say it, I accept it. But what’s it
got to do with us?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Melinda? Oh, Paul…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Melinda? Melinda Moores?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You really think you can help her?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s not a bladder infection, or even a
busted-up mouse. But there might be a chance.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hold on now. You’re talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hal would never allow that. You know him, he
wouldn’t believe something unless it fell on him.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: So you’re talking about taking John Coffey
to her. That’s more than just our jobs, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Damn right. That’s prison time if we get
caught.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s not discuss this like it’s even an
option. Brutal, help me out here…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I’m sure she’s a fine woman…</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: The finest.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s happening to her is an offense, Brutal.
To the eyes and the ears and the heart.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I have no doubt. But we don’t know her like
you and Jan do…do we?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s why it’s a lot to ask.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It is. Let’s not forget Coffey’s a murderer.
What if he escapes? I’d hate losing my job or going to prison, but I’d
hate having a dead child on my conscience even more.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t think that’ll happen… …in fact, I
don’t think he did it at all.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just can’t see God putting a gift like that
in the hands of a man who would kill a child.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Well, that’s a tender notion, but the man’s on
death row for the crime. Plus, he’s huge. If he tried to get away, it’d
take a lot of bullets to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We’d all have shotguns in addition to
sidearms. I’d insist on that. He tried anything, we’d have to take him
down. You understand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: So. Tell us what you had in mind.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I was never here.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Shit, for five bucks, you was never
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Fellas thirsty? Fresh out of the icebox.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh, thanks. That’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey. Hey, I’m’a get some too.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: My ass you get some too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You think you deserve any?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Day report says he’s been okay.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hell, yes, I been behaved. C’mon, now, don’t
be stingy hogs.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You gonna stay behaved?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: C’mon, you clunk, gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You promise me, or I’ll drink it myself right
here in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: C’mon now, don’t be that way. I be good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cup.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ll break out the fire hose and take it
anyway. And you will have drunk your last R.C. cola. Unless they serve
’em down in hell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anybody wants to back out, now’s the time.
After this, there’s no turning back. So? We gonna do this?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Sure. I’d like to take a ride.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Guess were all in.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Payback.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Let go of me! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Settle down, Percy!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Oooo, Poicy! What would your mother say?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Let go, you ignoramus! I know people! Big
people!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you’ve said. C’mon, stick out your arms
like a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: I won’t. And you can’t make me.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You’re dead wrong about that, you know.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You gonna put your arms up? I’ll rip your
ears off. Use ’em for tea caddies. You know I will.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The man’s ripping your ears off, Percy. I’d do
as he says.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Please, Paul. Don’t put me in with Wild Bill.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You would think that.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: You’ll get ’em back, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: That’s more than I can say about your jobs.
All your jobs! You can’t do this to me! You can’t!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let you in on a little secret. We can and we
are.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re going to have a few hours of quiet time
now, so you can reflect on what you did to Del.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: If you get lonely, think about Olive Oyl…
…uk-uk-uk-uk!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: One more time–what do you say if somebody
comes by?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Coffey got upset, so we put him in the
restraint room. They hear any noise, they’ll think it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: We goan for the ride now?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’re over in Admin, going over Del’s file.
Brutal and Harry are in the laundry doing their wash–</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where you fink you’re goin’?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You’re a bad man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: S’right, nigger. Bad as you’d want.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Whooeee. Whole room’s spinning. Like I’m
shit-ass drunk. I have me some shine or what?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Niggers oughtta have they own ’lectric chair.
White man oughtn’t havta sit in no nigger ’lectric chair, nossir…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: He’s a bad man.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: They’re still in there. Pieces of them,
still in there. I hear them screaming.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John, come along! Right now, y’hear? C’mon!
Toward that door!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Lie down on this. It’ll be easier for you and
no harder for us.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Say. This is fun.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Look, boss! It’s Cassie, the lady in the
rocking chair!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shhh. John, you have to be quiet now.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You see her? You see the lady?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We see her, John.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: C’mon, big boy, keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: How far is it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just up ahead…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Hey there, little firefly. Where’s
Mrs. Firefly this evening?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Oh, there you is. You come out to play
too?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They seem…drawn to you.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I love ’em, is why. They don’t think no
hurtful thoughts. They’s just happy to be. Happy little lightning
bugs…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: C’mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John? Do you know where we’re taking you?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Help a lady?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right. Help a lady. But how did you
know?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I don’t know
much’a anything. Never have.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Bye, fireflies. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We can still turn back.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss, look. Someone’s up.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: This is a mistake. Christ, Paul, what were
we thinking?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Too late now. Harry, keep John here until we
call you.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Who the hell goes there at two- thirty in the
goddamn morning?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hal, it’s us! It’s Paul and Brutal–it’s
us!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Paul, what are you doing here at this hour?
Jesus, it’s not a lockdown, is it? Or a riot?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hal, God’s sakes, take your finger off the
trigger…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Are you hostages? Who’s out there? Who’s by
that truck?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: John Coffey! Halt! Halt right there or I
shoot!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Hal? Who are you talking to, you fucking
cocksucker?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No one’s hurt. We’re here to help.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Help what? I don’t understand. Is this a prison
break?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t explain what it is. You just have to
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What do you…want?</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Hal! Make them go away! No salesmen in the
middle of the night! No Fuller brushes! No French knickers with come in
the crotch! Tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling d…d…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just to help. Just to help, boss, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You can’t. No one can.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Don’t you go up there! Don’t you do it!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Boss, you just be quiet now and let me
be.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Stay out of here! Whoever you are, just
stay out! I’m not dressed for visitors, you rat’s asshole!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Oh, so big! Pull down your pants! Let’s
have a look!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Don’t come near me, pigfucker.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Why do you have so many scars? Who hurt you
so badly?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Don’t hardly remember, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: John Coffey, ma’am. Like the drink, only not
spelt the same.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Yes, John Coffey?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I see it. I see it.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You be still now. You be so quiet and so
still.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: John! Sick it up! Cough ’em out like you
done before!</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’s choking! Whatever he sucked out of her,
he’s choking on it!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: How did I get here? We were going to the
hospital in Indianola, weren’t we? We stopped and you bought me a packet
of posies…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Shhh. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Did I have the X-ray? Did I</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was clear. There was no tumor.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Who is that man?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John? Can you turn around? Can you turn around
and see this lady?</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: John Coffey, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Like the drink, only not spelled the
same.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: No, ma’am. Not spelt the same at all.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Melly, no…</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: I dreamed of you. I dreamed you were
wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other. We found each
other in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: It’s St. Christopher. I want you to have
it, Mr. Coffey, and wear it. He’ll keep you safe. Please wear it for
me.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Thank you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Thank you, John.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: C’mon, John, stay on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Christ, he goes down, we’ll need three mules
and a crane to pick him up again…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’ll never sit in Old Sparky. You know
that, don’t you? He swallowed that stuff for a reason. I give him a few
days. One of us’ll be doing a cell check and there he’ll be. Dead on his
bunk.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If that’s his choice, he’s earned it. Let’s
get him back on the Mile.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Am I glad to see you! You were gone so long!
Wild Bill’s making noises like he’s gonna wake up… What the hell’s wrong
with him?</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’s hurting, Dean. Hurting bad.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John, we’re gonna set you on your bunk now.
Ready?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What about Mrs. Moores? Was it like the mouse?
Was it a…you know…a miracle?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Yes it was.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Damn. I think we got away with it.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: We still gotta convince a certain somebody
to keep his trap shut.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Get his stuff.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want to talk, not shout. I take the tape
off, you gonna be calm.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: My mother always said if you do it fast, it
won’t hurt so much.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: I guess she was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Get me out of this nut-coat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Now! Now! Right n–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You shut up and listen. You deserved to be
punished for what you did to Del. You’ll accept it like a man, or we’ll
make you sorry you were ever born. We’ll tell people how you sabotaged
Del’s execution–</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Sabotaged!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –and how you pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we’ll talk, that’s a given–but, Percy, mind me
now…we’ll also see you beaten within an inch of your life.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We know people, too, are you so foolish you
don’t realize that? People with friends and loved ones doing time in
this prison. People who’d be happy to amputate you nose or your penis
just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the
exercise yard every week. Let bygones be bygones. Nothing’s hurt so far
but your pride…and nobody need ever know about that except the people in
this room.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile.
Always has.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: May I be let out of this coat now?</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: My things?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Think it over, Percy.</p>
<p><strong>percy</strong>: Oh, I intend to. I intend to think about it
very hard. Starting right now.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: He’ll talk. Sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Easy, easy. You all right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’a you looking at, you limp noodle? You
wanna kiss my ass or suck my dick?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Oh God, oh God, no…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Punished them bad men.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why Wild Bill? Why?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I saw in his heart. When he grab my arm, I
saw what Wild Billy done. Saw plain as day. Can’t hide what’s in your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What? Saw what?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Take my hand, boss. You see for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul, no!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: My hand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No…please…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a little bit
of myself. A gift, like. A gift of what’s in me so you can see…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You lover your sister? You make any noise,
know what happens? I’ll kill her instead of you. And if you make any
noise, I’ll kill her.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: He kill ’em with they love. They love for
each other. You see how it is?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: That’s how it is ever’ day. That’s how it is
all over the worl’…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: …well, I dunno, he just snapped, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …s’right, one minute he’s fine, the
next–blammo…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: …bastard grabbed him through the bars a few
days back, scared the boy so bad he wet himself…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Son! Son! Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Speak up if you can hear us! We gotta ask
you some questions!</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: I think this boy’s cheese slid off his
cracker.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’ll cover you as much as I can, even if it
mean my job, but I have to know. Does this have anything to do with what
happened at my house? Does it, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It makes sense. I read the file. Hal even said
it himself. Wharton rambled all over the state last few years, causing
trouble. Hell, longer than that. Been at it since he was ten. Vandalism.
Petty theft. Setting fires.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You saw him. You actually saw this Wild Bill
person take those girls.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Their father hired him on for a few days last
spring, help repair the barn. Cheap labor, just another drifter…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Only not.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sick bastard came back a month later, just
before dawn. Took the girls…did what he did. Coffey found them
afterwards and tried to help. It was too late.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Then you can stop it. The execution, I mean.
Get Coffey a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Based on what, honey? Some kind of magical
vision I had?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Show this farmer–what’s his name,
Detterick?–show him a picture of Wild Bill. Why not? If Wharton was
there…if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was
there…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Him being there in May doesn’t mean he came
back and killed those girls in June. Even if he was committing other
crimes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They got their killer as far as they’re
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Then lie.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Lie? About what?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Tell them Wharton confessed to the crime.
Brutus, you can back him up, say you heard it too. You can say that’s
what set Percy off. He shot Wharton because he couldn’t stand thinking
of what happened to those two little girls, it snapped his mind… …what?
What now?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We never reported anything like that. We
would’ve, too, everybody knows it. It’s part of our job.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Besides, confessing don’t make it so. Slugs
like Wild Bill lie about everything. Crimes they committed, women they
had, even the weather.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: But he was there! He painted their barn! He ate
dinner with them!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All the more reason he might take credit for
the crime. He’s gonna fry anyway, so why not boast?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: All right. Then you’ve got to get John Coffey
out on your own.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You did it once, didn’t you? Only this time,
don’t bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Ma’am, your son’s grown up and moved away. My
kids are just starting kindergarten. Will you be the one to explain to
them why their daddy’s in prison?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Work out a plan. Make it look like a real
escape.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Better be a plan an imbecile could dream up.
Nobody’d believe it otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Even if we did think of something, it
wouldn’t do any good.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Why not? Just why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Because he’s a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded
black man with barely enough brains to feed himself. How long you think
it’d be before he was recaptured? Two hours? Six?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Do you mean to kill him, you cowards? Do
you?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Don’t touch me! Next week this time you’ll be a
murderer, no better than that man Wharton, so don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I’m so sorry I called you a coward. I feel
worse about that than anything I’ve ever said to you in our whole
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Even that time we went camping and you called
me Old Stinky Sam?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Does Hal know? That Coffey’s innocent, I mean?
Can he help? Does he have the influence to do something about this?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Then don’t tell him. If he can’t help, don’t
tell him. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: There’s no way out of this for you, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. I’ve been thinking about it, too, believe
me. Tell you the truth, honey. I’ve done some things in my life I’m not
proud of, but this is the first time I’ve ever felt in real danger of
hell.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Hell? Oh Paul… Talk to him. Talk to John. Find
out what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Hello, boss.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess you know we’re coming down to it now.
Another couple of days. Is there anything special you’d like for dinner
that night? We can rustle you up most anything.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters with gravy.
Okra, maybe. I’s not picky.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about a preacher? Someone you could say a
little prayer with?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Don’t want no preacher. You can say a
prayer, if you want. I could get kneebound with you, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: S’pose I could, if it came to that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John, I have to ask you something very
important right now.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I know what you gonna say. You don’ have to
say it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I do. I do have to. John, tell me what you
want me to do. You want me to take you out of here? Just let you run
away? See how far you can get?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Why would you do such a foolish thing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: On the day of my judgement, when I stand
before God, and He asks me why did I kill one of his true miracles, what
am I gonna say? That is was my job? My job?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You tell God the Father it was a kindness
you done. I know you hurtin’ and worryin’, I can feel it on you, but you
oughtta quit on it now. Because I want it over and done. I do.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I’m tired, boss. Tired of bein’ on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to
be with, or tell me where we’s coming from or going to, or why. Mostly
I’m tired of people being ugly to each other.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, John. I think I can.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: There must be something we can do for you,
John. There must be something you want.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I ain’t never seen me a flicker show.</p>
<p><strong>fred astaire</strong>: Heaven, I’m in heaven…and my heart
beats so that I can hardly speak…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Why, they’s angels. Angels. Just like up in
heaven…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I be all right, fellas. This here’s the hard
part. I be all right in a little while.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John, I should have that just for now. I’ll
give it back after.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and
had me a dream. I dreamed about Del’s mouse.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you, John?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I dreamed he got down to that place Boss
Howell talked about, that Mouseville place. I dreamed there was kids,
and how they laughed at his tricks! My!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I dreamed those two little blonde- headed
girls were there. They ‘us laughing, too. I put my arms around ’em and
sat ’em on my knees, and there ’us no blood comin’ outta their hair and
they ‘us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles roll that spool, and how we did
laugh. Fit to bus’, we was.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What should we pray for, John?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Strength?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: God, please help us finish what we’ve started,
and please welcome this man, John Coffey–like the drink, but not spelled
the same– into heaven and give him peace. Please help us to see him off
the best we can and let nothing go wrong. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I know a prayer I once heard. Can I say
it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You go right ahead, John. Take all the time
you need.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray for me…</p>
<p><strong>kathe and cora</strong>: …and every child. Be my strength, be
my friend…</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: …be with me until the end. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Die slow, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: They’s a lot of folks here hate me. A lot. I
can feel it. Like bees stinging me. It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Feel how we feel, then. We don’t hate
you–can you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Kill him twice, you boys! You go on and
kill that raping baby- killer twice, that’d be fine!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wipe you face before you stand up, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Roll on one.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Does it hurt yet? I hope it does! I hope
it hurts like hell!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: John Coffey…you have been condemned to die in
the electric chair by a jury of your peers…sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state. Do you have anything to say before
sentence is carried out?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I’m sorry for what I am.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: You ought to be! Oh, you monster, you damn
well ought to be!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Please, boss, don’t put that thing over my
face. Don’t put me in the dark, I’s afraid of the dark.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right, John.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: …heaven…I’m in heaven…
heaven…heaven…heaven…</p>
<p><strong>brutal</strong>: Paul. You have to say it. You have to give
the order.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: He kill ‘em with they love. That’s how it is
ever’ day. All over the worl’…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Roll on two.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That was the last execution I ever took part
in. Just couldn’t do it anymore after that. Brutal either. We both
transferred out, took jobs with Boys’ Correctional. That was all right.
Catch ’em young, that became my motto. Might even have done some
good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t imagine you would lie to me, Paul.
It’s just that…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …It’s quite a story.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes. Quite a story. One thing I don’t
understand. You said you and Jan had a grownup son in 1935. Is that
right? But if that’s true…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The math doesn’t work, does it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You feel up to a walk?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There. It’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul? This thing you want to show me. Is it
scary?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Scary? No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Paul? It isn’t…it can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come over here, boy. Come on over her and see
this lady.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That can’t be Mr. Jingles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue au cirque du
mousie.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh, Paul. Don’t make him do it again. I
can’t bear to watch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But he loves it so much.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This isn’t exactly the Mouseville we had in
mind…but we make do, don’t we, old fella?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: As I live and breathe!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Fooled you, didn’t I Got yourself a little
love nest here, I see…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: …what the fuck? Is that a mouse?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t hurt him, okay? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s a goddamn mouse, y’old fool, they carry
all kind’a disease…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: …now step aside.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You leave him alone, Percy! You leave him
alone, or by God I’ll–</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Who you calling Percy? Name’s Brad, you senile
fucker. And I’m gonna nail that mouse, you can take that to the
everfucking bank.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How dare you? Get out!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch. Me and
Paulie are talking.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: His name is Mr. Edgecomb. If you ever call
him Paulie again, your days of employment at Georgia Pines will end.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Who the hell you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I am the grandmother of the man who is
currently Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. A man who
loves his relatives, Mr. Dolan. All it would take is a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: At first I thought I’d let you be. I’m old,
and that seemed easiest. But when my friends are threatened and abused,
I do not let it be. Now get out, or you won’t work another day here. Not
another hour. I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t know what you’re getting so het up
about. Just a damn mouse.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get out, you ignorant man. What little mind
you have is ugly and misdirected.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t bother coming back here
tomorrow…Mr. Edgecomb Gonna be a new lock on this door. This is
off-limits to residents, no matter what Mrs. My Shit Don’t Stink has to
say about it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Little trick I learned from Percy
Wetmore.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is your grandson really Speaker of the
House?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You gonna thank the lady? She just saved your
old mousie hide.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident. I
think when we electrocuted Del, and it all went so badly…well, John
could feel it, you know…and I think a tiny part of whatever was inside
of him just leapt out… Me, I was no accident. John had to give me a
little part of himself…a gift, like…so I could see for myself what Wild
Bill had done. When John did that, a part of whatever power worked
through him spilled into me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He…what? Infected you with life?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s as good a word as any. He infected us
both, didn’t he, Mr. Jingles. With life. I’m a hundred and five years
old, Elaine. I was forty the year John Coffey walked the Green Mile.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: …oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I haven’t even had a cold since 1935. I’ve had
to watch my friends and loved ones die off through the years…Hal and
Melinda…Brutus Howell…my wife…my son… …and you, Elaine. You’d die, too,
and my curse is knowing I’ll be there to see it…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …that’s my punishment, you see? My punishment
for letting John Coffey ride the lightning…for killing a miracle of
God…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …you’ll be gone, like all the others, and I’ll
have to stay…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll die eventually, I imagine. I have no
illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death long before
death finds me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In truth, I wish for it already.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Jingles?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where you been, boy? I’ve been worried about
you. You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I lie in bed most nights, thinking about it.
And I wait…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think about all the people I’ve loved, now
long gone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We each owe a death, there are no exceptions,
but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile is so long…</p>
