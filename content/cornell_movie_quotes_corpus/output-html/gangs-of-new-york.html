<h1 id="gangs-of-new-york">gangs-of-new-york</h1>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: No. Never. The blood stays on the blade,
son.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Did you bring the boy for a charm,
Priest?</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: No, Jack. For a baptism.</p>
<p><strong>rabbit warrior</strong>: We’ll send a few across the river
today, Priest.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: What’s the fight?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: The Dead Rabbits against the Native
Americans, same as ever. But it’ll all be settled today.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Are you Native or Rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Looks alright. I’ll stand by you, then.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I suppose there’s to be a fight.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Derry?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Donnegal. Name’s Monk Eastman.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: lf there’s money in it.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Fight for the Natives. They have a proper
war chest.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Well, I might at that. But I thought I’d ask
you first, seeing as how I’m not quite a Native American myself.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Let’s see your skills, and we’ll talk of
payment later.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me
double. Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a
SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT
streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge
man, in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally
makes his head look even bigger.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Stand with us then.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we
assembled? A MAN in a leather duster steps forward. He is young, lean
and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is real.
The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved, instead
of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: On the challenge of the Native
Americans, to settle for good and all who holds sway.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Bene.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: By the ancient laws of combat, we
offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before
us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: But this time can you bear to look on the
glory when it comes, Bill? Can you see it clear with your single
eye?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Whoever fights untouched in battle
has skill, but the warrior who returns wounded has been touched by
God.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: It wasn’t God who touched your eye.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It was God gave me guidance. Will
you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator, and not look
away? No honorable man turns an eye from his death.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: I don’t expect a death blow from your hand,
Butcher. Let’s have at it.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: There is another matter.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Say it out and quick, before spring gets
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: No Native American Warrior will
dishonor himself with the blood of the halt and maimed.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: So we would like to know whether
Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits can smile out of both sides of
his face.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Prepare to receive the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: I run with you! I’m one of you! Born a Native
American from the blood of five generations!</p>
<p><strong>peg-leg</strong>: Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You need a weapon? Use a knife. He
puts the struggling boy’s hand on the hilt of the knife that the Butcher
sunk into his father’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It makes a deeper cut. And, HIS
HAND GUIDING THE BOY’S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Say a benediction, Priest.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Hold this close to mind, boy,
should you ever think of going up against the Native Americans. Bill the
Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious signal, the
fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes a
battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and
sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Ears and noses will be trophies of
the day.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Can’t..can’t cross the river… with steel
through my heart. Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a
move. This is clearly something he is meant to do himself. Amsterdam
grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon tries not to
cry out. The knife does not move. Amsterdam tries again. He can’t budge
the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his
strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony. Amsterdam is pulling so hard he
raises his father’s back four inches off the ground. Still the knife
will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain. Now, finally, someone
steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with
grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last
desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father’s heart. He throws it on
the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the
knife and hands it to Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: That’s yours, rightfully. Now Monk leans over
the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon’s coat, REMOVING some
money.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: And this is mine. Only what’s owed. Use the
rest for funeral.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No! He tries to shove Monk away from his
father, when the Native Warrior intervenes.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: It’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: Hon …</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No, Pa!</p>
<p><strong>vallon</strong>: … honor me… think of me … don’t never look
away. Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.</p>
<p><strong>rabbit woman</strong>: Take the body. Bring the boy. Several
RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at them,
like an animal.</p>
<p><strong>rabbit warrior</strong>: Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be
done now.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Get away! Get away!</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Leave him be. He’s his to mourn.</p>
<p><strong>department, united states of america.”</strong>: The sun has
nearly set. A boy–about 10 years old–sits on the edge of the Castle
Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about make
out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY
SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness. Abruptly,
he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In SLOW
MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current,
each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a
puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where’s your family, sonny?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: My mother’s just there.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: On the trip, her insides all broke up. She
wasn’t dead and there was three others fighting for her bed.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: And your father? Where’s he, then?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I never knew him.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where all those streets come together
right ahead is the true Five Points. But most speak of the Five Points
and mean anywhere between the Battery and the Bowery. Although the
night’s cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival
Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of
laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little
Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this
highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging
garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap
of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes
by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Streets hereabouts are lively of an
evening. The city comes here to sport. But there’s places to put up a
boy on his own.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And those? What are those?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Well, those. Those are, as you might say,
a sort of…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: … sort of whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>transvestite</strong>: Say, policeman. I’ll buy your bonny
friend.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: We passed the plate amongst ourselves.
Come up with enough ned to carry all this, and carry you a while,
too.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Where will my father rest?</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Potters Field, with everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: My father won’t be buried with everyone
else. He’ll lie separate in fresh ground, facing east.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: What difference where he faces?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: He’ll face east for the second coming of
Christ.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the
Battery you show Him the way from there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cornelius</strong>: Will you have music, entlegen</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My daughter’11 do any song you like.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Not tonight, Maggie, we got…</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Any ned in your pocket, sir.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: She sing sweet as she looks?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Pure celestial, sir. Go on, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, Jen, the other.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Mr. Tweed would like a word,
Mr. Cornelius. Tweed of Tammany.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: In your office. At your pleasure, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. mortuary office</strong>: As the door opens, we see a
man gazing out the narrow window onto the spectacle in the next
building. He is in his late 20s, already a little fleshy but dressed
with dash: WILLIAM TWEED… “BOSS” TWEED. He shows a bemused, almost
schalarly interest in the goings-on next door. This mortuary is located
next to a bordello, where the windows are uncurtained and the energy and
variety of the activities inside is astounding.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Mr. Cornelius. With a view like this I’m
surprised the dead can rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Is there anything I can…</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Yes. A favor.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Happy to serve, Mr. Tweed.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Excellent. Lend me something.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Oh, I don’t know what I could …</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: I believe in form and appearance, you see.
Just like yourself, sir. And I believe in law, and the power of example.
Our city is a lawless wilderness, sir. I’m asking you to help chasten
it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: A matter of civic duty, then.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: And civic pride. I want you to help me set an
example. I only need to borrow one of your clients.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Tomorrow your cortege will cross
Paradise Square, into territory protected by the Native Americans. You
will be permitted undisputed passage both ways. That is our tribute.
After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the Native Americans and willing
to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. All others will be dispatched.
He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastman
looking at him with easy interest. Bill the Butcher STARES him down, but
Monk’s gaze never wavers.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll expect you first.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Me? Oh, I don’t know. All that talk of blood
loyalty makes me quake. I’ll spill blood when the price is right. But
blood for ceremony? I prefer holy communion.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You saw us fight today. You know
we can pay any price.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Not mine. Not now, and not any time after.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We’ll see. Independence is a
slippery thing. But being a rival … well, that’s dead dangerous. Bill
brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES. Now the RABBITS
file out, with Monk among them.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Come on, boyo. I’ll put you up
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’ll do for myself, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: You can’t. There’s no mistaking you’re
his son.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What’s the cost to bury my father proud
and proper?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cornelius</strong>: For a plot, a headstone, hands to
break the earth…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cornelius</strong>: What are your current means?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cornelius</strong>: Of course you’ll have to wait three
days for a city permit. But all this may do for part.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That’s owed another.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Firewood?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s a penny the load.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Come on! Help me, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Easy, crusher. What’s this all
about?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Ask the boy.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in
honor. He told me I had to wait on a permit, but he only wanted time
to…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Make another Arrangement, looks
like. For advertising. Better go along. I’ll see to all this.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The boy…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Take the little malefactor. The
Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off to
their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Give the boy what he paid for.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Ain’t his first Tombs trip.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: What do they call you?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Your full name.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Vallon.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: First name?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Address?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Got none.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: I’ll put city. Now what’s your age? Maybe
twelve. Got a family?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No more.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Well, where was they from when you had
one?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: City.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Disrobe.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: What’s the charge, Asbury?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Theft. Assault. Creating a …</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Through that door there. And don’t stand too
near no one else.</p>
<p><strong>visitor one</strong>: Ought to be served in a trough,
properly. Will you try some?</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: Probably. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>visitor one</strong>: All-Sorts. It’s made of all that’s
poured and not drunk, and any they can salvage that’s spilt.</p>
<p><strong>visitor</strong>: Your health.</p>
<p><strong>gamemaster</strong>: Alright, gents and ladies, your bets now
on Towser against the vermin, the count to beat is ten rodents in three
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>guard 2</strong>: You get to live private until they come
from the orphan’s asylum. On account of your tender years.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Let me see! I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: No! It’s a danger.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh come on! It’s not. Then tell me where you
got it.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: From some man. He took me in his carriage.
He only wanted to do something to me fast.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: I didn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Would he do the same with me?</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: I won’t tell you if he’s around again. He’s
my secret.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Better keep it more careful, then.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You come into the Five Points and
you stole from me.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You stole Vallon. He was my kill.
My example, of my power. You took him and made him yours.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: You’re a lunatic to come here like…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Thank you. Just listen good. The
Native Americans holds the Five Points. We have prevailed. What you do
outside the Points is your deciding. Outside is your city. Inside the
Points is mine. Anyone who says different, or does different, or thinks
different… … theylll draw my unwelcame attention. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I do understand, yes.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: But you don’t understand at all.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: There’s a whole city to share and all
you see is your own narrow streets.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You just stay out of my place.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Yes, alright. Gladly. It’s all blackjack
jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It’s good work.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: As far as it goes.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You wouldn’t be talking to me
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: But we’re talking about different
things, Bill. You describe the present. I see the possibilities. Look to
the future. There is so much more.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: There’s things demanding to be done that
no police force can do, not even an obedient one. There’s contributions
from every dive and brothel. Loyalties to be secured and debts to be
collected.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We work for no one.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: … beside Tammany… in the performance of
these civic obligations. And for a satisfactory… I’m prepared even to
say equitable… financial participation. It’s not the sort of
responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized. But then, the
founding fathers never imagined the city New York has become.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Maybe you Tammany boys should do
your own lifting and carrying and muscle work. Might build you up.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: We’d like to. I do miss it. But it’s
wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Then get cops to do it.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must
be upheld, especially while it’s being broken.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Appearance means nothing.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Perhaps not within the Points. But the
smart man could go higher.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: If you can talk plain, maybe we
can do business.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Anyone inside?</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: No, praise God, but all we own…</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Waiting on reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: That’s not them. It’s only the Black Jokes.
Seems your fire interrupted their festivities.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: May I point out that the building is burning
to ashes?</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Certainly. And may I then remind you,
Pocahontas, that this entire area is the province of the Americus
company, and you will kindly keep your distance. Impasse. The rival Fire
Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building
continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire
plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second
BELL sounds. Tweed’s “reinforcements” have arrived: the Native
Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the
horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK.
As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Alright, boys! To work!</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Next building over, boys! Mustn’t let it
spread!</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Another proud night for Tammany, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Just tell them… … to take enough to share.
And not to steal so in the open.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the
fire from the front and loot out the back.</p>
<p><strong>tearful woman</strong>: The Black Joke could have saved my
house!</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Black Joke had no business here, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>tearful woman</strong>: Their business was to save my
house!</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Tammany’s your business. When we’re here to
call upon there’s no need of other. We understand loss, Madam, and take
care of our own.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: It’s Blackwell’s Island certain now,
boyo.</p>
<p><strong>third guard</strong>: Are you hurting? Let’s hear you!</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: There’s nothing funny, boyo! You been
beat and turned back four times now.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: But every time you bring me back… you got
to come further to catch me.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. corleaps’ hook pier night</strong>: Through the THICK
FOG comes a ghostly apparition: a tattered SKULL AND CROSSBONES, made of
rags, fluttering from the mast of a leaky, unstable vessel. The bow of
the small boat breaks the fog, and on board we see: a hulk called SHEENY
MIKE KURTZ and a huge black kid named JIMMY SPOILS, manning the cars.
Johnny Sirocco, grown wary and wiry, peers into the fog like a lookout,
while Shang Draper, at the tiller, looks anxious. The HULL of a large
boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards away.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hard starboard, Shang! Hard starboard!</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: I told you forget that sailor stuff! Which
way’s star… Too late. Their Ticket craft crashes into the side with
enough force to make a LOUD THUMP and to send Shang sprawling.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Why don’t we just knock on their front
door?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Spread out and make for the cabin. Moving
slowly, the boys FAN OUT and move toward the cabin at the far end of the
deck. Johnny stays close to Shang, holding onto the shipls rail for
support.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Nothing. Looks picked clean.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Bill and the Natives must have got here
first.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: What …</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: That’ll bring the Harbor cops for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wait! Take him. If he’s still alive he’s
good for ransom!</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Hels dead as Good Friday, can’t
you…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Then we’ll take Bill the Butcher’s cleaver
and sell the body to the medical students. They’ll go five dollars for
it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Come on. We’ll get something out of this.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: The Harbors!</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: We can’t go back to Corlears Hook,
they’ll be watching…</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: We’ll make for Blackwells.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: And which way’s that through this
fog?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: Should have asked them directions as
they drifted by, Shang.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: You’d have liked that, wouldn’t you Coal
Face? You’re the only one they’d miss in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Let’s quiet, or we’ll all be found
out!</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Alright. We lay up here till first light.
Then we run back across the river.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: River pirates!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Head straight out, then turn for the
current.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Figured you for dead.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Close enough.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: This is my crew. And welcome to join, if
you’ve the mettle. We’re river pirates and quick thieves and street
brawlers…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Yeah? You’ve no business saying anything
against us! Do you know how much you cost us? You know how much that
body’s worth?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I doubt it’s worth the water it’s
floating in.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them
medical ghouis.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’ll make it back for you whatever it is,
once we’re in the city. Just keep sailing, or we’re all done for.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Go ahead then. He was in his prime. He’d have
fetched thirty dollars easy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: You’re as flat as Broadway going
north. We can’t run the river no more. We’re poaching the Natives and
the Harbor cops are looking for us.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about
them?</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Youlre all sand when it comes to cops,
Shang. But do you have the sand to go against the Natives?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: It ain’t the time to go against the Natives.
We’ve got to build first. Then we go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: If we go like we did in the river, all
of us’ll sink.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Does Shang have the sand to ever go
against the Natives?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t know. He acts like it.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: If he only acts, held be better on the
stage. Like her.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the
best bludget in the Points.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Shes his mort, is she, as well as his
best provider?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah. But Jenny says she’s anyone’s she
chooses.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: That’s the prize of the month. Spice Islands
silk.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: You’ll learn our way if you’re going to be
one of us, Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Every one of us gives a portion of all they
steal to the gang. Morts more than men, being morts.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Yeah? And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Because morts have more resources. Men can
work only on their feet, but a mort can turn out on her back.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I mean, why give at all? Why don’t they
keep for themselves?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: If you think there’s something off about my
way of running things, you got no place in this gang.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I got no place anyway, and you got no
gang. This ain’t a gang, no matter what you say. It’s a mob.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can
set him right.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You boys settle with me before you settle
each other.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: I’ve come for my due and proper,
Shang.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: As agreed, then, Jack. Refreshment?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Still smiling, are you?</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: It’s the young Vallon, is it? I hardly
recognized you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I hardly knew you under that hat,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There. For your respect.</p>
<p><strong>happy jack</strong>: Anybody else? Any number at all, come
on.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Is that sand we’ve just seen?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s politics.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’ve got my own way to go, why don’t you
find yours?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Because your way’s different, and I want to
see where it goes. Unless you say otherwise. Amsterdam shrugs and keep
walking.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You act like you have something in mind,
like you know every day what you’ll be doing the next. Me, I don’t
figure on tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Well, if you shut up a while maybe it’d
come on its own. Now what the hell’s that?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh that’s heaven.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to
live and Tammany gave it over to this minister.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdan</strong>: What’s Tammany?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why Tammany … you don’t know? Tammany makes
the city run. A political organization that’s like… like the Native
Americans, only ranging over the whole city.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They seem like the law, but they got a way
of acting outside the law. Anything that happens in this city, on the
straight or on the sly, Tammany’s a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart
of Tammany.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They’re the best gang there is.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: So if Tammany’s the best, go with
Tammany. What are you running with this mob for?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: ’Cause they’re more my size for now. With
Tammany, you got to do something large, something that makes them take
notice of you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdan</strong>: You’re better oft without their notice.
You can run free, work your own schemes.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: But if your schemes have size, you need size
to bring them off.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Let me in if you ever get it figured.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’ll go on my own from here.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and
beget vermin.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: We can’t have every citizen of the Five
Points boxed up like cargo.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: But the season is vicious, and I must take
thought of our constituents. Mr. Gleason, I’d like you to shake hands
with Mr. Barnett Baff…</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: A friend and owner of an estimable carting
service. Work out an arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the
benefit of Mr. Gleason’s wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At
a cost, Mr. Gleason, of how much the barrel …</p>
<p><strong>gleason</strong>: Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: …and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and
distribution…</p>
<p><strong>baff</strong>: The same again. At least.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: At least. That’s a price of fifty dollars.
And greedy, low piracy at that But a price that Tammany, in its
generosity, will meet. Merely submit a bill for a hundred. We’ll each
have half. And I’ll retain this box for further experiment. Hello,
Bill.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Bolt the door.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Scotchy Lavelle’s gone wrong in his
accounts.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I know. Scotchy’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our
share from Sparrow’s and use it for his own. You got to give him over,
Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I can’t do that. No matter what he
steals, I still get more from him than any two others. As do you.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: Alright then. What about Charles McGloin?
He’s running a panel game off to one side. Did you know that? I can’t
get a day’s work done for all the good citizens pouring in here
complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuse
Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect … a few practically suggest.
… our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them
Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an
example.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Charles McGloin will do.</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: I’ll set the trial for Friday.</p>
<p><strong>assistant hangman</strong>: Those interested in the effects
of the condemned please come forward.</p>
<p><strong>assistant hangman</strong>: What am I bid for this coat? A
coat of some wear but excellent cut… containing a rather remarkable
pocket silk…</p>
<p><strong>man in crowd</strong>: Bid a quarter!</p>
<p><strong>hangman</strong>: A quarter, thank you. Do I hear fifty
cents? Fifty cents?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Here. Just for the silk.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Do you have any last remarks, Charles
McGloin?</p>
<p><strong>mcgloin</strong>: Not from under this hood I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mcgloin</strong>: I never struck a foul blow or turned a card
and may God greet me as a friend!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I hope you won’t think me rude if I speak.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t want you to think me forward,
you see.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Does it matter to you what I think?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I might like it to.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I mean, if you would like.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I might like, sir. But I can’t say now.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Because this is my stop.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: May I walk with you a little, then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That would be too bold.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But I’ll never see you again.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my
father.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll look for you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: May I walk with you a little, then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you a spy, then?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Got no one to spy for. I’m an
appreciator, you might say.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Appreciator of what?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: A good touch.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t bother with the chat. If you want me,
we come to a business arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide
how you suit me. Then I do it or not.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Just take a minute, I was Just…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know what you was just. I had years already
of what you was just. You know how I got so good at thieving? So’s I
wouldn’t have to lay down for everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when
I want to for how much I want to. Otherwise I don’t do it, and don’t
have to do it, and to hell with anyone’s rules but my own.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What about Shang’s rules? You pay a lot
over to him. The better your day, the better his. It don’t seem gute
right.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Give him this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How’d you come by this?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I got my own touch.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you making me a present, or making an
Arrangement?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s your rules, right? So you
decide.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where’d
you get that?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: From Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: It don’t suit you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing
concerning conditions.</p>
<p><strong>citizen</strong>: Nothing but our safety, of course.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All’s snug around Paradise Square in my
company, squire. See there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make ’am
safe.</p>
<p><strong>woman citizen</strong>: Even against them?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Against them especially. Let me
demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll be back for this at our leisure.</p>
<p><strong>woman citizen</strong>: You dare leave it here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it’s
mine.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: You know that’s Jack’s.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It should be hangin’ off Jack’s vest,
then. Not here, like some war flag.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: That watch is a small price for free run of
the Points.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: If it’s free, how come we pay so much? Wo
shouldn’t pay for what’s our due.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: We don’t tight when we don’t have to. It’s
not warring that counts. It’s the living day to day.</p>
<p><strong>ansterdam</strong>: Is that right? Did I hear that correct?
John, did we hear that correct?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We heard the same.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: So then.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’d you do to my watch, you dirty little
bastard…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hands won’t be so quick in future.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: That’s enough sport this evening, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It wasn’t him.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I have word for you from who did it. You’re
to meet him at Sparrow’s Chinese Pagoda.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right, step out, you yellow…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Hello, Happy Jack. I’m the one you’re
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then you’re marked for dead.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: I gave no order for this.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Never mind giving orders. What were you
giving this for?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: I’m calling you out, Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I got this at the hanging. It was Charles
McGloin’s. Everybody here saw you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin
doing with it? What’d you give it to him for?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: I didn’t give it to him. Why would I give it
to him?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I gaw you give it to him. Last week,
behind the Old Brewery.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: He’s gone flat. I got no reason to trade with
the Native Americans.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What about stepping up in the world, as
it were, and leaving the rest of us behind. There’s a reason. Making a
separate arrangement for yourself with the one Native so stupid and
luckless that he got hung. That’s you to the ground, Shang.</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Who believes what he’s saying? Can any of you
believe what he’s saying?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Bene. We’ll see. Any of you that believes
I did proper by Happy Jack Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you
that still likes Shang’s way with the cops, and Shang’s way with the
Natives, go to him. Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just
see which of us is left standing?</p>
<p><strong>shang</strong>: Let see where they stand.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What’s your pleasure, Shang?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: This mob ever have a proper name?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We was called after Shang when we was named
at all.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: We’re the Dead Rabbits from now. They
were the best. They were history. They were legend, and we’ll live up to
them.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What’s this then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Payment for the silk.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You were waiting for me out here, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Maybe I was, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You was that sure of me?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting
don’t cost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It don’t do to be sure. I could go away just
as easy.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll say when I want to, not you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Stay then. One way or another, I get what
I want.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’re a gypsy, are you, come to tell my
fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me what I’m wanting.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You got blood in your eye for someone.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s just I can’t look away, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Who from?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Bill Poole.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You better get someone else in your sights.
No one’s ever taken him.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: ’Cause he’s mine, that’s why. I’ll take
his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You have a plan for this? You going to raise
a militia? I’ll wager Bill the Butcher don’t even know about you or care
if he does.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: He’ll know about me soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And after the Butcher?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’ll be in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Love you? You just had me. You can have a
mort any time you want. So why look for more than that.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That’s taking love, not giving it. I want
it to be just you and me, no one else for either.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: ’Cause none of us means nothing in life
except one to the other.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know I want to mean something, to you
or anybody. Can there be good in that?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’ll take a while if we do. If we ever
do.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: And what about the meantime?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Meantime’s business.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: The potato is a thick vegetable. Heavy.
Meaty. Comes out of the ground dirty and stays that way unless you scrub
it and boil it to death! We don’t want to keep lem out of the country!
We’ll even give ’em a place at our table! But we ain’t gonna vote ’em
into office.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Any Irish hears that will be out for
blood.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: The Irish is too busy building up
Tammany. That’s where their brains and muscle goes. Once they’re inside
with their cronies, they turn on their own outside. Tammany’d steal the
air and rent the daylight if they could.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: We’d do the same.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Tammany earns better. That’s the
difference.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I ain’t seen their ned yet.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You will at day’s end, that’s our
arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether they’re repeaters or not. I’m
telling you, we got a square deal.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: It’s sound, Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Yeah? Well, it’s ned anyway. Just make
sure you count it when we get it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s just a day’s job, we don’t have to make
it a life’s work. We work for Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if
that’s our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: So we’re politicians just for
today.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Not for a minute. We’re better than that.
We’re thieves.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: He’s got the right to vote, damn
you!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Not four times he don’t. There’ll be no damned
repeaters here!</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I would never speak ill of a rival. I
would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my
observation, however, that every horse thief is a Know-Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: The Know-Nothings are already finished,
and there’s four more hours at the polls yet.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Keep our men voting. Everybody works
today. It’s not a victory we need, Daniel. I want a triumph.</p>
<p><strong>repeater</strong>: I already voted once today. Cast for
Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Once? Come here and do your duty.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Line up like soldiers!</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: They got no notion what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You explain their democratic right. Illl
see they unterstand.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: I come to see if our counts square. You
boys have made a remarkable showing….</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Who the hell’s this?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s our Tammany man.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: … remarkable…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Our own Tammany man. We are coming along.
Happy to meet any friend of Johnny Siroccols.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but
one in the whole Five Points.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Best but one? Who’s better?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Maybe nobody. But when the count’s done
the numbers will tell who’s come out in front.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’m in no race. Just pay us what you
owe.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Tonight. At the victory celebration.</p>
<p>****: Read what it says there, alongside the ruby…read it out …</p>
<p><strong>well-wisher</strong>: “Fortuna Juvat Ordentes.”</p>
<p><strong>tweed</strong>: A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany.
Now, tell ’em what it means, Mayor Wood.</p>
<p><strong>wood</strong>: “Fortune favors the bold.”</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: What do you think? Would that make a fit
motto for our fair City?</p>
<p><strong>wood</strong>: Well, I could certainly see …</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: We’ve got a motto.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: what is it? Well, hell, let’s get one we
can remember. We’re going to build a new City hall, we better have
something to put over the front door. And Mayor, you’ll make sure the
Latin’s right?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I don’t know you, you don’t enter.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Come on, what are you saying? If you
don’t know us now, you’ll know us tomorrow and you’ll be working for us
next week.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Daniel Killoran knows us.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Oh he does?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We work for him.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: The hell we do.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Tampen down, will you?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Why don’t you all get the hell out of here
and go fix on a story? Go on!</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: It’s all right, Nat. They’re saying the
truth. They gave a good day’s work for a good wage.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: A fine first showing. But second best.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Second, eh? You don’t say so.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: It’s no shame to be bested by veterans.
The Native Americans always sweep the field.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: We count on them sure as mass comes an
Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Did you know this? Is this some scheme of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No, I didn’t have no idea …</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I was working the same side as the
Natives? The Natives?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: That’s only right. Bill the Butcher’s our
ambassador throughout the Points, as you might say. It’s deemed an honor
to work with him. Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him,
everyone …</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I sure as hell don’t fear him. And I sure
as hell won’t stand with him, or any who calls him one of theirs.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Well, if it’s matter of personal honor,
the money can only be a further insult. I have no wish to rile you
further, so if you’ll allow me…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Where is he? Where’s Bill the
Butcher?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Listen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If
you and Bill Poole have matters to settle, you can do it any other time,
any other place, I don’t give a good dancing goddamn. But you do it here
tonight and all the Five Points will be down on you like the righteous
wrath of heaven. or you could, as the Book says, put away childish
things. Join the celebration. Personally, I always find the least
strenuous solution the most appealing. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I got experience. It’s the education I
lack.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And you heard I was a good teacher?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t listen to talk, I figure for myself.
And I figured you’d be good at everything you did.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And tonight I got the ned.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And now what?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Now I’m ready for you. Unless there’s an
arrangement between you and Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not to my thinking.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Amsterdam… listen up, Amsterdam…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You going with me or him? It’s my thinking
matters here. You don’t have to ask him nothing.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How’s the evening passing?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Fine. Why?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: ’Cause it’s treating me fine too.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: This is no game, you and me. Don’t go on
like it’s a game.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I said already, it’s not a game. It’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>master of revels</strong>: Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you
please … we will now… raise the cages and start the bidding!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Evening, sir. Are you prepared to
be celebrated? Are you ready to be famous?</p>
<p><strong>groper</strong>: How much will it cost?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Just a moment of your time. My men
will assist you.</p>
<p><strong>pagoda spectator</strong>: Watch this careful. I’ve never
seen the like, not even in Barnum’s Museum.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: What’s it so quiet for? I don’t
need quiet.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: There’s for your beauty and your
song.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Mr. Poole!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Bill Poole!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: My compliments on your exhibition,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It was like watching a dance. Some great
grand goddamned dance. You know me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Do I? Are you missing a
finger?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No. A father.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: That’s a New York name. shall we
drink to it?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Indeed. And to my other name. Vallon.
Will you drink to that?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Priest Vallon’s son? Of course
I’ll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain’t
worthy of you. You ain’t worth what they feed on, and what they shit’s
too good for you.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: What do you want, boyo?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I got to give you something, Butcher.
Something from my father.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You got the sand to draw a blade
in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here,
you son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The Butcher’ll kill him if we don’t do
something.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: It was Amsterdam’s own doing. And it’ll
be our death too if we try to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The truth is you don’t give a damn about
him.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us
he wouldn’t have called out the Butcher in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: What do you say? Loin or shank?
Rib or chop?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Come on, let me hear you! You’re
all talking at once, I can’t hear you! I don’t hear the choicest cut!
The best, the vital! The heart. I think I must have the heart!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Come on, look at it! You fancy
yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator! Watch the death blow when it
comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: It’s been a full evening’s fun now,
Butcher. It’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You got nothing to do with this,
Monk.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastmkn</strong>: Well I’m the game warden, you might
say. I’m telling you this buck’s too young yet. Wait till he’s aged for
a proper kill.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: The hell.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastmkn</strong>: Just settle yourself Bill …</p>
<p><strong>monk eastmkn</strong>: … and let the merrymaking
continue.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: It was his father took me in first,
and it’s thanks I’m returning now.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Eastman!</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: This squares any debt. Get him out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Monk Eastman!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll have you then!</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Come ahead, Bill. Unless you’re
wanting to shout me to death.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: If these two are going to combat, it
aught to be a worthier occasion. And more rewarding for all.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for
the customary good job today… and an equally bright future for us
both.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Will you drink with me, Bill, as a
friend? An honored friend.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: If there’s one thing I can’t abide,
it’s fighting for free.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Go easy! Go easy. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He knew what he was doing, hitting you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Let’s get him up.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Therels too damn little of him left to know
anything.</p>
<p><strong>don whiskerandos</strong>: Someone’s here for you.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: That so? What’s he look like?</p>
<p><strong>don whiskerandos</strong>: He looks pretty damned sorry.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Face is too sore, eh? I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No. I’m beholden enough to you as it is.
I don’t like to be beholden.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: We’re all even, son. There’s nothing
more between us.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’d like it if there was.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Are you proposing employment?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to
get strong before we make another move. I figure you’re the one to make
us strong. There’s a lot we can learn from you.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Boyo, I’m a freebooter and a
mercenary, not a teacher. I can’t learn nothing from you and I can’t
earn nothing from you either.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious
again. We’re going to reign over the Points.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: And Bill Poole’s Natives? What will
they have to say?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Nothing. They won’t have tongues left to
speak.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Don’t worry about what theylll have in
their mouths. You think about what they got in their hands. Listen, son…
take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father.
Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger spoils
an edge.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Then you say no?</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: You see my instrument there? First
notch represents two dollars and fifty cents. That’s how much I got for
my first kill. There are forty-eight more notches after it, and my fee
has grown with each one. I can accommodate you alright, but you got to
afford me. So do business with me or do it on your own.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Everything I got is still to come. So I
guess it’s on my own, then.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Fair enough. You’ll find independence
a fine thing, a fierce thing. Although I do hold money preferable to
all.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Bound to.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Tammany’s here to take the chill off the
winter and the weight off your heart. It’s Tammany can make this city a
fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You sent me word.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: We could use help here. Grab a sack.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I keep my hands clean.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: So I’ve observed.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Better be on your mark to talk
like that to me. It was you stopped me at the Pagoda. I would have cut
Monk inside out.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: What if you hadn’t? Think of the
embarrassment. And what if you had? Consider the waste. Next time you’re
in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans. It’d be a
grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It touches my heart how you
always. have our best interests in mind.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Our mutual interests. That’s why I want
you to contact Monk Eastman. I want you to extend a proposition. I want
him to join US.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could
no more have him there than you. But he should throw in with the Native
Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and … well, use his
influence, shall we say, to enrich us all.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You’re saying I can’t do
everything you need? You don’t think the Natives has been doing good and
right? You think there’s something more he can do that I …</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: It’s none of that, Bill. None of that.
His independence is like a rebuke to Tammany. And an insult to you.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Then you should have let me have
him at Sparrow’s.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I should. If I’d been
confident-absolutely certain–that you would have prevailed. Monk is an
unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needs to be reckoned
with.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: He needs to be killed.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: No. He’s an elemental force. Them you
don’t destroy. But you can contain them and use them for the good they
give off.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Coal?</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: And this is your offer?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It’s Boss Tweedls offer.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: How do you think we’d sit as allies,
Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: The only way we could tolerate
being near each other would be stretched out dead.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: My thoughts exactly. Then why are you
here? Because you were asked to be. You were ordered to be. And who
would order me among the Natives? You? And would you follow my orders,
even if they was being relayed from William Marcy Tweed himself?</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Dubious and doubtful, my friend. But
your offer–pardon, the offer you bring–is the most generous that’s ever
been extended. I favor the terms, if not the personalities. So let us
decide the way any Native American would appreciate. We’ll do it the
democratic way.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Citizens of the Five Points! It seems
the Native Americans have come to trouble. They have grown so weak that
now they seek my help. They can pay any wage I ask. But I ask you now.
Even for money, should I carouse and conspire alongside a boyo like this
with gristle on his knife and spittle on his chin every time his cock
gets hard?</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: There. You see. I’m afraid the people
have spoken.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll see you again, you bog Irish
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Well, if it’s a fight you want now,
Bill, remember to come back with a bankroll.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: Ah, the Native Americans, is it
now?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Are they coming?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We don’t want a ruckus, minister.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: Nor do I. I intended no
disrespect. I’d heard the Native Americans were figures of the greatest
prominence here.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Indeed they are, just for the moment. Let
them come. Happy to have them. Everyone’s welcome in a house of God,
isn’t that right, Reverend?</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: As all are welcome in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Ild like to go to heaven. Ild like to
go to heaven and bite off Gabriells ear.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: You’re still welcome, even with
such peculiar appetites.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: But if the Natives do come, Father…</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: I’m not a priest, son …</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: … there’s no accounting for what may
follow.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: I’m sure God’s hand will guide us
in that. Just as He guided you here at the right perfect time, with a
right perfect regent. The young lady with the sunset hair. Miss …</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Everdeane. Jenny Everdeane.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: Miss Everdeane. Step forward,
please.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: And the evening’s regent chooses
her evening’s partner.</p>
<p><strong>reverand raleigh</strong>: Here we make only joyful noises to
the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: Now. The men, please. One by
one.</p>
<p><strong>reverend raleigh</strong>: Next Gentleman, please.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: So you accept?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You accept to be my mort and no one
else’s.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, it’s just that I didn’t recognize you in
the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s not the Butcher, it’s the dancing.
It shifts my face all around.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Maybe you’ll look better later.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I will if we’re together later. And what
about after that? After tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I chose you just for tonight. If that’s not
good enough I’ll go with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’ll have tonight. But after this don’t
come to me no more till you’re ready. No more.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Amsterdam. Amsterdam!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t want to come in! You come out.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Just a damn minute.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m going to fight you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I’m tired. How about
sometime else?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You want to tell me what this fight’s
over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny? Alright, alright. Then tell me why like
this?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So when I lose no one will see.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Satisfied? It wasn’t me that’s been dancing
and shagging all night.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That’s it then.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The hell.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Goddamn you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly
gentle.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: What’s the trouble, Don?</p>
<p><strong>don whiskerandos</strong>: There’s someone here.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: It’s just a man of commerce.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You’re right enough this time,
Monk. Go ahead. Go on with your work. I’ll finish my business.</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: Come out with it then.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You damn craven, do it!</p>
<p><strong>monk eastman</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Your eyes was open for that
alright. And you still got one to see this.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: If I was you I’d use that to open
in a new location. Consider St. Louis.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: The war club.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I promise you, Amsterdam. I
promise you.</p>
<p><strong>greeley</strong>: I may enjoy the bounty of your table and
the pleasures of your company, Mr. Tweed …</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: And the pleasures of the company
provided you, Mr. Greeley.</p>
<p><strong>greeley</strong>: …without the Tribune endorsing your
politics.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I suppose you can at that. Take with one
hand, flay with the other. Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but
Tammany’s in your heart.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’m not good enough for your
table, so I eat where I can. It’s good, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Pheasant.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Is that like pigeon? I killed a
pigeon once but it didn’t taste nothing like this.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: You killed a bull this morning. I told
you to make an Arrangement with him, and you come back with his blood on
your hands.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: He insulted me. He aggravated me.
I couldn’t stand for that, for no one.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: You stand for anything if I tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You think I should be afraid of
you. You act like lightning strikes when you talk.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I never was afraid of you, so
don’t think I was or act like I was, you ain’t earned it.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: What did you earn us, killing Monk?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Where’d you earn the right to ask
that question? You raised some dust in the streets a while back, but no
more. You got power but you ain’t got muscle and you ain’t got a notion
what it means to be a warrior.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I see it lost you a lot of God’s sense,
along with that eye.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You don’t know nothing about that!
It was my doing! It says in The Book, “If thy eye offend thee, pluck it
out.” I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever
fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to
death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was
worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still
have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed
Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got
glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: You need two eyes to see the depth,
Bill. That’s how we help each other. If it wasn’t for me would be happy
enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don’t know
nothing else. But Bill, I’m only saying… I’m counselinm… look in the
distance. You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always
remember who the host is. It’s not a matter of courage welre talking.
It’s manners.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Howls these manners?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Fine, if you’re hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’m always hungry.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I’ve always told you, Bill. There’s
plenty for all, and more for us together than separate. We’ll dine
together sometime.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that
the Butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the Five
Points–a man of myth and moment–who is there to take his place? Of
course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He’s too useful to be
killed, but he must be checked.</p>
<p><strong>killaran</strong>: It could be a police matter.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Impossible! Any cops who might have the
mettle to go against the Butcher have blood ties to the gangs. They
can’t be trusted. And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be
any use. If Bill’s to be checked, it must come from within the Points,
not without.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for
elections. That Amsterdam boy has sand.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: That so? The last time I saw him he was
under the Butcher’s knife looking like a fine filet. Who else is
there?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to
Slaughterhouse Point. There’s Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the
Plug Uglies, but there’s none that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits,
or the stake, neither.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: What would that be?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with
the Butcher. He’s sworn revenge for the death of his father, and he’s
got the heart to carry it forward. He’ll have the skill and power soon
enough.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring
them along, then. Nurture the Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where
they like.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: And if they roam into some portion of our
own revenues?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I’d tolerate a little trespassing if it
was for a higher good and use. They’ll cross with the Natives soon
enough and keep each other occupied.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Bill’s got to be a lot more than
occupied.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I’ll hold Bill in check. If he becomes
unwieldy … well, damn it all, Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old
musket. What do you think of that, eh?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: It’d be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even
edifying.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn’t
have that. I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some
of that food for the canaries.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We ain’t had no milk this week.</p>
<p><strong>native 2</strong>: You can have as much as you can pay for.
Anyone that’s got the ned, step up with your pitchers. Any not, come
back when you do.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I got ned enough for all. See? Fair
enough?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s our rate? What do we charge?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Johnny worked it out to a nickel less
than the Natives. Just till we’re established. Then we raise it a penny
more than now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Raise it? Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You say, then.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: There’ll be no paying at all this day. Or
this week, neither. This is Dead Rabbits business from now on.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’ll take ned if you got it, now or in
future. But no one will go without.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Except us. You opening a charity?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: They’ll pay us what they owe, in loyalty if
not in cash. Tammany gives coal, we give milk.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: They can afford it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can’t we?</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: This place is so clean it’s the next
thing to chaste. And safe as a convent, too.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: From the Natives, maybe. But not from
us.</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: You’re saying I got to worry about
your mob too?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No worries at all. You throw in with the
Dead Rabbits and we’ll worry about the Natives.</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: And if someone else comes along, do I
pay them too?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You only pay us. We see you safe from
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Leave off her. She don’t want you. Not even
if you could pay her.</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: Hey, just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He can’t pay. I can pay.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Maybe I should offer Johnny as a bouncer
for your busy nights.</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: A bouncer! I don’t know if he could
bounce on a feather bed. He wants to be a character like you, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: He’s got his own ideas. Too full of
Tammany, maybe, but he’s a fast friend.</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: But in my trade you go on your
instincts. My instincts says to heed you, and my memory of your father
says I’m right. We’ll shake on it. And have one of my best to seal the
bargain. Megs!</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: Come here and show my new friend why
we’re worth special care.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You liked that old man? You would have gone
with him?</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: I like anyone that pays, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Tell me what he wanted you to do.</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: He mostly wanted comforting.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I never seen hair so black. Can you take the
pins out?</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: It takes so long to do back up.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Did your mother have the same color?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Lie back, I want to look at you. What’s that
mark?</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: I always had it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And there? Is that a scar?</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: There was a baby. They cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And that on your shoulder? That looks
old.</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: Yeah, I got that when I …</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t want to know when. Don’t tell me
about before or what you used to be, I don’t want that.</p>
<p><strong>emma loss</strong>: What about your scars. Do you have
scars?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: None I ever seen. Maybe you can find
them.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Go on. I can see you later. Megs leaves,
brushing past Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I couldn’t decline what Mother Joyce
offered. It’s in the interests of business. You understand business.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sure I do. But there’s something else I still
don’t understand. At Sparrow’s Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was
me?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Yeah. I did.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Meantime’s over.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Oh fine. That’s fine. I’d be celebrating
but I’m losing too much blood.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Put your head back.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Put your head back I said.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: So why so sudden, then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain
I can’t decide. Now I decide, you say it’s sudden.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s the whore did it, then.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s because you’re jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s because you didn’t lie about hitting
me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Christ, I wish I had. Come here,
then.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not here. There’s too much past.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It must be morning.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t care, I’m not getting up.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is what you meant, then? It’s going to
be just the same from now on?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Every morning I wake up next to you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Or you don’t wake up at all.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We only just started in and you’re already
threatening me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s not a threat. It’s a declaration of
love.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I prefer my kind. This kind.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What’s this? Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You said I was the best thief in the Five
Points. But I got restless. Will you wear something I got?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My jeweler’s.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t see nobody.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That’s the best time. They’re all having
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’re off your head.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You can wait on me a minute. Or I’ll see you
back in the Points if you’re scared. Don’t worry. I know every house on
this street. They all leave their doors open. They live like they’re not
in New York.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on. I might still be taken for a maid.
But you’re nobody’s notion of a butler.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The Police Commissioner lives the next street
over. I was thinking of visiting him next month, but cops don’t buy
goods. They keep all their graft in cash.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How’s that for ten minutes?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’s a lot to fence.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m not going to fence it. I’m going to keep
it and take it where no one will recognize it.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Where would that be?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Somewhere west. Far west. Past the
Mississippi River, somewhere into that territory.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That’s a hard journey for a woman
alone.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’d be with me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You got it all planned and straight, is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Once I said I’d be with you I wanted
someplace we could be together. Someplace better than here. What’s the
matter with that?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Nothing. Except there’s no place but here
for me right now. I got to settle things.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, I know, but I’m talking about settling
down, not settling debts.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You don’t have my obligations.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s a fair day’s wage. We just move the
people out of the building, and collect.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Who from?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who owns the building. Them.</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: I’m glad you came in force. There’s half a
hundred people still in there.</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: And not one’s given rent the whole year.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You live here?</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: No, no, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I mean in the city. A ways north, I’ll
bet.</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: Yes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s not just citizens in there?</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: Of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: with arms?</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: From their damned gang. Some of them live
there.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Some of who?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We didn’t contract for that.</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: We’ll pay extra for the danger.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No danger. But you will pay extra. Let’s
go and greet some Natives.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Alright, then?</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: Very much alright. Quite a spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Oh really? Just the entertainment you
favor, is it? Pardon me for a moment, gents. You wanted to settle, you
and me. That’s so, isn’t it? You did agree, did you not.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I did, yes.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Good, because I didn’t want to act hasty.
I can never tell for sure what you’re thinking, and sometimes I’m not
always sure what you’re saying…</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: Excuse me, we have to finish and…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Excuse me. We’ll conclude in a moment.
Where do you settle?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Amsterdam, what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’m asking, where does anyone settle?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know, you mean a place, a home?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: A home yes.</p>
<p><strong>gent 1</strong>: Excuse me, but we really must conclude.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Well, I’m saying to you then, Jenny
Everdeane, welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Fine place. Room enough for all. Get them
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>gent 2</strong>: They’ll come back looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: With whose help? The Natives? They won’t
help these flourishing bastards even for ned. Tell any who wants they
can stay. If they can’t pay rent they can join the gang. But make sure
the best rooms go to us. Look around …</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know this building.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: These lead all under the Square, into the
Brewery and out again from there. They’re closed off and forgotten since
the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We lived in this building till she lost her
seamstress work and we went to the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk
she never woke and I brought her back here. Dug this myself. Families.
Give here what I gave you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: She’ll keep an eye on this for us. How about
some help?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You trusting me with your treasure,
then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just take another look at it to remind you. I
can always do fine on my own.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s mine is yours, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I could use this, too.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You making an offering to the Reverend
Raleigh?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Are you sure we can trust your
mother?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: The building and how many?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: A dozen at least of my
Natives.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch
alright.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I want at them. All of them, and
Amsterdam especial. Now.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Not just now. It’s between too late and
too soon. They’ve become a little too prominent for comfort, but they’re
still too small for you to soil your hands. The man who killed Monk
Eastman pushing around a mob of upstarts. It’s practically
undignified.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: To hell with any of that.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Very well, and to hell as well with any
plans you and I may have for growth and change and even greater reward.
You’ll never advance anywhere beyond the limited perimeter of your
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I don’t got to advance anywhere
further.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Got to, no. But ought to.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: An invitation. To dinner.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: He never had his own cross. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Your touch is light, but as a tracker you
work awful heavy. Come ahead. Now that I met your mother, you should
come and meet my father.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You should finish the stone.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’ll be finished when everything’s
finished. That’s when helll rest. The hand that killed him is the hand
that will bury him in peace.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It was Bill killed him, not you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: With my hand on the knife.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And his hand on yours!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: And me feeling the life go out of my
father! He looked at me … he looked at me and he swore me with his eyes.
I could feel his spirit… I say I could feel it rising… flowing through
the knife like blood into my own heart.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You talk like he lives in you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t want him to live, I want him
dead! I kill Bill and I’m free of them both!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You think you can be free that easy? You need
your way so clear, and you’’’ use anything to clear it. Anyone, too. Me,
everybody, we’re all just a way for you to settle your damned
ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’re part of me now, like the gang is
part of me and my father both. If I can bring us to glory, then my
father… like The Book says…my father can enter his house justified.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: All of us is set on the same road
together. The gang can have everything they ever wanted and get me what
I want while they’re doing it. We’re not interfering with each other,
we’re helping each other. It’s all the same, we’re all one together.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: We’ll all have a share of the profit like
we’ll all have a portion of the fame. If we come to be notorious, that
only means we’re strong, and if we’re strong that means we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>tamlas.</strong>: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from
these uniforms during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film.
Only Johnny,</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: And I’ll know that time, know it right
off when it comes. Just like I knew you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterda.m</strong>: And just like that, there’ll be no way
of stopping till it’s ended.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Now! Finish him now!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Our man will take him in another five. What
puts you in such a hurry?</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: I want to extend thanks and admiration not
only to our two combatants today, but to their sponsors, the Dead
Rabbits … … and the Native Americans.</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: Their generous support allows me to bring
you this splendid exhibition. With their indulgence I’d like to remind
you also of the further wonders that await you at my new Museum, located
on Broadway…</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: … P.T Barnum’s gallery of wonders from
worlds natural and unnatural, from nature and from myth! And to
encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances forbidding
sportive violence on land shouldn’t dampen your enthusiasm for wagering.
Bets down, entlegen, and you gents.. … fists up!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Dobbs will take him this round. That’ll be
something. The Natives has never lost before.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Because there’s never been a Dead Rabbit
fighting before.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’ll shame them thorough.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: There’ll be worse than shaming. We only
got the Natives in range.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t push the Natives too far, Amsterdam.
Otherwise it’ll be Tammany pushing back.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That don’t matter any more.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It does matter, and it’s going to matter
even more. Tammany’s the heart and future of this city. If the Rabbits
is going to keep growing, we’re going to have to throw in with Tammany
some way.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They got that Conscription Act from
Washington keeping them busy, but they won’t leave us alone forever. And
the Natives is strong as they ever been!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You call that strong, John?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: This is our time now!</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: The winner… gentlemen, please! … the winner
in the 39th round is the Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs …
please, gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There’s a
word for us all. Amsterdam promises …</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: To the death. If he can stand up to
it.</p>
<p><strong>barnum</strong>: … on which money, I hasten to add, may
certainly be wagered. The names of the two champions are Amsterdam
Vallon, here beside me, and … and Mr. William Poole, known to all as
…</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: They know me by any name, you son
of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll have him stretched on a
spit!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You got no more to say about this
now.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet
nurse! My challenge, your terms.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: Don’t do it, you can’t do it! There’s the
Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too. That’s your
calling now, not these ancient quarrels.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll do my work. But this is a
shame, a public shame. It demands my attention. Fine, then! Fine and
welcome! Day after elections, we’ll meet with seconds on neutral ground
to work out time and terms. It will be done and done.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You know this hand. Last time it
was this close, it was on your throat.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I remember it better from another
time.</p>
<p><strong>start close on</strong>: money being counted out: $300. And a
RECEIPT quickly written and given. We think at first this must be a bet
being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher-</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Your release from service, according to the
terms of the Conscription Act. Keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<p><strong>prosperous young man</strong>: I’ll keep it with me.</p>
<p><strong>draftee 1</strong>: Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three
hundred dollars too.</p>
<p><strong>draftee 2</strong>: Tell him if he don’t we’ll come get you
on our way to Gettysburg.</p>
<p><strong>prosperous young man</strong>: Oh, Mr. Tweed, I’d take the
time to say proper thanks but…</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: No thanks owed, son. Conscription’s
Federal Law, and so’s the $300 exemption. You might remind your father,
though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law’s strictly and
equitably enforced.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: You see how much they like this damned
law? Enforcing it’s going to hurt us in elections.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: It’s not my law, and not my liking,
either. But Washington’s always treated us with sufferance, and we must
extend the same regard to them. Boys, we are bound by honor and love of
country to fight in this time of crisis!</p>
<p><strong>draftee 4</strong>: We’re bound by our wallets and the
emptiness in them, that’s what!</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Boys, the union is in distress, our land
is wounded deeply, our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing. We
must ask ourselves how…</p>
<p><strong>draftee 5</strong>: Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat
wagen, Tweed. But let’s see you fight!</p>
<p><strong>draftee 6</strong>: That’d be worth twice three hundred
dollars to see!</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Thank you, boys, thank you for your
understanding. Holy Mother.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Daniel, between the blindness of
Washington and the damned brass of Bill Poole Tammany will fall like an
autumn leaf. We must take what measures we can. Attend to the Butcher.
After the elections, of course. Unless you think Amsterdam will do our
work for us first.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: He could at that. Then he would become a
fresh concern</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Not so daunting as this. Boys, I’ve just
had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand
and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great
struggle…</p>
<p><strong>outside draftee</strong>: Put a rope around it, Tweed, and
swing in your own wind!</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever
happened to the halcyon days?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I swear that science will be the death
of industry.</p>
<p><strong>killorkn</strong>: The telegraph moves the voter tabulation
by wire faster than we can get the repeaters in and out.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to
explain. Do something!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: If you’ll allow me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: There’s a scheme we might try.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: You got no place among us, get the hell
out of here however you come in.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: A moment please, Daniel. One moment.
You’re a Dead Rabbit, aren’t you? Friend to Amsterdam? And therefore no
particular friend to us. What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Opportunity. Science and opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: You got opportunities enough among your
own.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I did have. But times change faster than
people. Some people, anyhow. And I like to stay with the advantage.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight!
Are you suggesting… or perhaps you’re even saying… that your friend and
your gang may be … well, lagging behind the great march of history?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Something like that, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Well fine, step up to history then and
tell us what you have in mind.</p>
<p><strong>start close on</strong>: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the
election returns. And, below it–far below–Johnny, Killoran and a couple
of TAMMANY BOYOS, looking up at the wire.</p>
<p><strong>boyo 1</strong>: I ain’t goin’ up there. I got my election
suit on.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This election’ll be over unless we get up
there.</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: “We?” This was your notion, you go up
there.</p>
<p><strong>boyo 2</strong>: Him. He looks likely, and he ain’t
workin’.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sheeny Mike, you want to make … …how
much?</p>
<p><strong>boyo 1</strong>: A dollar.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Five dollars? Just to help us?</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: What’s the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam
wouldn’t like it, working with Tammany.</p>
<p><strong>boyo 2</strong>: Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn’t like it
…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He knows about it. Welre working a whole new
scheme. But I won’t tell him youlre helping, if that’s the way you want
it. And you can keep the full five. Just start climbing.</p>
<p><strong>sheeny mike</strong>: Where’s the ned?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will
see to him.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: He wasn’t Tammany. Not like you.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He made the right choice.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You don’t know what you’re saying! You
killed one of our own. One of your family!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t know he was going to die,
Amsterdam. And don’t tell me what’s my own and what isn’t. You’re not my
family. And I swear, I swear on the Virgin Mother’s eyes … I know what
I’m doing, Amsterdam. It’s you that’s always been blind. I’ll say my
farewells.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You still smell like drink.</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected
to third term! Tammany ticket prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows
Armageddon for crime!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Can’t you hear the future?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: We say the Square is the place. Let
Barnum sell the tickets for a share of the price…</p>
<p><strong>native second</strong>: A small share.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: And the Rabbits and Natives will split
the majority portion equal.</p>
<p><strong>native second</strong>: Who works the crowd?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Nobody. This is a day of honor. No
pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’ll cut their hands off. After
the fight.</p>
<p><strong>native second</strong>: We got to fix positions for everyone
so there won’t be no other fighting. I know for fact the Roach Guards
has sworn blood against the Black Birds, and the Forty Thieves don’t
tolerate the Chichesters.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine
banquet.</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: My ned’s on the boy. He’s got the
youth, and he’s got the hunger.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Is he so hungry you’ll put up a
hundred?</p>
<p><strong>mother joyce</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Your honor… yes, and the law of the
land… lies in the balance. The Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down
by President Lincoln himself …</p>
<p><strong>crowd member</strong>: If Lincoln signed it, then let Lincoln
fight!</p>
<p><strong>crowd member 2</strong>: It’s an army of the poor fighting
for a bunch of rich slackers!</p>
<p><strong>crowd member</strong>: Tammany’s been our voice, let Tammany
pay the exemption for all!</p>
<p><strong>young crowd member</strong>: Your first payment, m’lords.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That must be the vanguard of Barnum’s
army.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This city will burn like Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Then we’ll take what we can before it
gets too hot.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I think it’s past that already.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: It’ll never come to that. These people
ain’t gang-led and they have no purpose.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Fight better and not get so mad. They’re
only doing what they should have done years ago. Why’d they ever think
there was another way to live?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: They believed what people told them, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What people is that? The Reverend at the
mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel Killoran? People like Johnny Sirocco?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You believed Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Hell.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And I believed you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I ain’t done nothing different than what
I told you, Jen.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I believed what you said abaut being with me,
with me alone. But you lied to me. It’s not me alone, it’s just you and
Bill Poole. Youlre so blood-blind you can’t see nothing else, not even
this!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t care a fine damn about what they
want! It’s what I want! They won’t dare harm the Points, that’s all I
care about! Let them turn the rest of the city into hell! It’s another
country anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don’t
know about you. Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Now is when I’m going. Will you come?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t want all this fighting to go to
waste, Jen. I want to come out of it with something. And I got to be
waiting for the Butcher.</p>
<p><strong>family man</strong>: We’re with you, don’t harm us!</p>
<p><strong>mob man</strong>: Show us your spirit and come out with us
then!</p>
<p><strong>mob woman</strong>: And put a candle in the window to show
you’re one with us! Every light is a flame against the draft!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Cops has everything closed to the
north, and the militia’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: My Daddy don’t have to die for you! Why should
he fight and die for you?</p>
<p><strong>matte</strong>: The surface of the water looks like a mirror
made of flame. The piers are BURNING. The docks are ash.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’d kill you for this.</p>
<p><strong>matte</strong>: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back
toward the river like rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No we ain’t going to fight, but we can
take something for ourselves out of this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: I want to know who hung them bodies in
the Bloody Angle. I want to address who done it.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Five thousand people in the street done
it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe Lincoln done it! There’s nothing you can do
about any one of them but stay with us. You’ll have a little of your own
back.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: These riots are a gift. They…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: … they’ve made everything clear, as you
might say. Are you with us, then?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Until I can get out. I’ll go with you…
…meantime.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Good. We’re going for the Armory at Canal
Street.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: The Armory! We’ll have to beat the
militia to get there.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: There’s a way through the lines. Jen, did
you see the cops and militia?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can show you from here where they are. I
doubt they’ll get to the Armory in force before midday tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: We’ll get there first. We’ll take
everything we can carry, and destroy the rest so no one else has the use
of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody. Then we’ll turn to real
business. We’ll go down to the Battery.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: Why, we going to take a sail to
Europe?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No. But we could, after this. We’re
going… …we’re going to take the banks. The government banks. Are we
not?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Seems we are.</p>
<p><strong>greeley</strong>: They attacked me! I had every sympathy for
them at first…</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these
riots were a rising against “unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers.” The
shame!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I suspended the draft at noon but the mobs
only grew more virulent. It is a criminal rising of the lowest class, of
the Gangsters and rabble who have been allowed by Tammany to run
lawless!</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: It was Tammany and the rabble that
elected you, Governor. And it’s Tammany and the gangs who’ll stop it.
Isn’t that so, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I won’t say nothin’ in front of
him. Who knows what business he’s here on?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: He’s here on our business and my
invitation. He’s already been of great help. What’s the opposition
strength, John?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Each candle is against you, gents.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: “Against you,” sir? Don’t you mean “us”.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Some of us come from those people, Mayor.
I’ll not deny they still claim part of me.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Which part? Perhaps your heart.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Gentlemen, I’m sorry you find it
necessary to question the loyalty of my friend here, and by extension,
my own judgement. So as proof … John, where will the mob go? What will
the gangs do? Go on, tell them what you told me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: There’s no telling about the mob. Or the
small gangs. But the Dead Rabbits … if I was Amsterdam…</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: As indeed you nearly was. Were.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: … if I was … I’d figure to take the Rabbits
to the Armory.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Would you agree with that, Bill?
Wouldn’t you do the same? If you were fighting against the militia
instead of beside them?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Beside them? What are you talking…
?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: You will have to fight beside them to
take the Armory. It cannot fall into unfriendly hands.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I can’t stand with the militia
against the people. I could never work the Points no more if I did.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: We’re all of us swept up in a great tide
of events, Bill. Have you learned to swim?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: I’m sure that Bill will do his usual
splendid job. But after that … well, I’m afraid he’s grown away from us.
He shows distressing signs of… shall we say, free-thinking. Crime
flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep
himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust… well, that you
might. If you can prove yourself further.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You already said in front of everyone you
trusted me.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: In vital things. Would I be talking to
you now otherwise? Vital things, but small things. Are you equal to
greater responsibility and opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Such as what?</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Ridding me of Bill the Butcher. He may
question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you had the
sand to go against him. He’d never expect it. Do you have the sand?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Let him in.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Did you miss us, John?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not a bit.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Are you here to spy?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t have to spy.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I know what you’re doing. I told Tweed what
you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You don’t know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re going after the Armory.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Am I now? Why do you think that?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: ’Cause that’s what I would do, and you and I
think alike.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: No more. And it don’t seem worth a visit
to tell me something you already think I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: There’s something else alright. Tweed’s
arranged to kill Bill the Butcher.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Who could Tweed get to do that?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: One of his own.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: There’s no one around him…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Listen, it don’t matter who, it’s going to
be done, that’s all! Tweed ain’t going to wait around for you and Bill
to settle yourselves. I’m telling you so you have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Chance of what?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: A chance… a chance to do what you want. Bury
the Butcher, draw what blood you got to. But you better make speed. The
Natives will move on the Armory too.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: And what’s any of it mean to you?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It means whatever’s left of friendship, I
don’t know. There’s still part of me here. I don’t want to see you lose
everything in your life at once.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’m going to lose nothing. If you believe
me, you can stay.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I got to go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: So Tammany’s going to kill the Butcher. That
puts you and Tweed on the same side. Does that make the path clear
enough to suit you?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Murder Me? No one’s going to
murder me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Then you better learn to fight locking
over your shoulder, Bill, because that’s the only way you’ll ever see it
coming.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I don’t believe it, and I don’t
believe it’s you telling me. You got no reason to care about any danger
to me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: One reason. You’re my kill, Butcher. No
one else is going to have you, not Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in
the street. No one–not even you, Bill–will ever take the pleasure of
your death away from me. I’d do anything to keep you for my own, even if
I have to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You protect me? Get out of here
and go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Fine, so long as I pass you on my
way.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Maybe I’d believe you more if I
knew who was talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Someone I credit.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: That means nothing to me. None of
this means nothing to me because I am Tammany. Without me and my Natives
they’re nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You join with me and we fight against
Tammany, fight them back and out of the Points. Then you and me can
settle. But if you don’t join with me, then there won’t be no settlement
because you’ll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be
mine.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I relish the thought… just the
thought… of cutting you up and opening you wide. So if just thinking
about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how I’m going to enjoy doing
it.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Why don’t I make it easy for you,
then.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Same as you’re making it easy for
Tweed.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Amsterdam! Don’t be like your
father. Don’t make it too easy.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Where’s the Native Americans?</p>
<p><strong>rioter</strong>: Ain’t seen them. Ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: And the militia?</p>
<p><strong>rioter</strong>: There’s a detachment coming on from two
streets over. The rest is still north of here. What are you after?</p>
<p><strong>rioter</strong>: The Devil himself couldn’t take that
place.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: That’s why he sent us.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Help me. Oh please help me. He’s shot, we
need a doctor, please help.</p>
<p><strong>detachment commander</strong>: Miss, we ain’t a medical
outfit. The main unit’s ten minutes behind us, they’ll have…</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Help us, we got wounded!</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: We can’t leave the post.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Open the damn doors then! We’re bad
hurt!</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Where’s the others?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Just behind us! But I got our major here
wounded so bad half his guts is out!</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: God, it’s good to see you!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Move fast! We got to get out with
everything we can before the militia gets here!</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: It’s from the Armory Guards. That’s the
last before the wire went dead.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: If the Rabbits are already at the
Armory, where the hell is Bill and the militia?</p>
<p><strong>killoran</strong>: They got to be near.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So long as they’re near, it’s alright. The
Rabbits can take the Armory, but they can’t hold it. If Bill can get
into position, he can make sure they don’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Alright then, John, you pray to any God
you choose that’s the fact of it. If Bill thinks he can best the
Natives, that is your opportunity. That is your moment. Are you a Bible
man? The Book says in Revelations, “I saw a new heaven and a new earth.”
If the hand of God’s not on you to fulfill that prophecy, then the hand
of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I don’t believe he can do it, Tweed.</p>
<p><strong>boss tweed</strong>: Oh, I think he can. Whether it’s one man
against another or a mob against the city, the mathematics remain the
same. You never enjoyed the enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor?
If you had, you’d know you can always hire half the poor to kill the
other half.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We move now and we can drive them
out! We press them and they’ll break!</p>
<p><strong>militia commander</strong>: I can’t spare the men or stand
the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Tweed put me in charge of this! I
say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move! Native Americans,
come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die
hunkered down, come with us!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We’ll show you gladiators’
greatness! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Was it Tweed or your friend put
you to this?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Tweed.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You’d lie to save your friend.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No. There’s no friends for me.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Me the same. Pity us both.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Hold your fire! In there! Hey in
there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Go on, then, talk.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You and me.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Come ahead then. And bring my friend’s
body.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Your friend made different friends
lately.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Tammany’s put us all in the same place.
You want to get out alive?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: It don’t matter to me. I got
enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia can move on me anytime.
You could drop me before I get to the door.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I don’t want to lose you so easy. You’ll
never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: You’d lay aside what’s between
us?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: I’m not forgetting where I put it.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: If you do, I’ll remind you.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: What’s your call, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: I’m considering where’s my better
chance.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them
some damn cover!</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Well, it seems like between us we
got two mobs that might make a gang.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Whose gang might it be?</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: Not William Tweed’s.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Which way you pointing that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy spoils</strong>: Any way you say. One direction could
let us out, the other will let them in.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: They got to come in if we’re going
to fight them.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Who do you want to fight, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: See you in the street.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: You’ll have a warrior’s funeral anyway,
John.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We’re finished, all of us.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: But you and me ain’t settled.</p>
<p><strong>bill the butcher</strong>: We got the same now, a full share
of nothing. There’s nothing to settle. There’s nothing left.</p>
<p><strong>amsterdam</strong>: Then let’s start over.</p>
