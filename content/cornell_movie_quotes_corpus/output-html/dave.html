<p><strong>smash cut</strong>: TO:</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Is everybody in there?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They’re waiting for you. And they’re very
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I wish I had better news… Our compassion index
is off seven points from the last sample and that’s down eighteen on the
year. The `Cares About People Like Me’ numbers are really in the toilet.
We’re off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised
interest rates…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Dammit… I told them no mayo. See - - I
could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don’t want to do
that…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you know why I don’t want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: … Because it’s got homeless shelters… and
Head Start centers … and… and…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hot lunches.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: … And hot lunches for little And if I kill
it… I’ll look like a prick.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And I don’t want to look like a prick! I
want YOU to look like pricks!!!</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Sir, we tried to kill it twice…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I don’t think so, Howard. If you had
killed it – it would be dead. When I kill something - - it always dies.
Doesn’t it, flob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Always dead.</p>
<p><strong>maj. leader</strong>: Mr. President, with all the work your
wife has done with the homeless…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Norman, I don’t want you to do this cause
you’re forced to… I want you to do this because you want to. I want you
to do it because you think it’s the right thing to do. I want you to do
it because you’re acting in the best interests of our country…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well – I think that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … You’ve got that radio address to go over and
the American Bar Association at the Monroe tomorrow night…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The Monroe?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Did you get someone to double for me
there, out front?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Try to find someone who looks like me this
time. That last guy was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re doing our best, sir.</p>
<p><strong>durenburger</strong>: This is a real special moment here at
Durenburger’s Chrysler Plymouth… Ladies an’ gentlemen, I wantcha to give
a real warm welcome to… The President of the United</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: A dead-ringer for the President appears,
perched on the back of a four hundred pound pig. He is DAVE KOVIC, our
hero. Dave enters from “stage right” wearing an Uncle Sam hat and waving
triumphantly to the crowd. A teenage *boy pulls the pig forward by a
rope.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thank you, Don. Thank you for that warm
introduction. You know it’s wonderful to be here today amongst so many
smiling faces.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And, Don, let me assure you from one chief
executive to another, that there fl no Chrysler Plymouth like
Durenburger’s Chrysler Plymouth.</p>
<p><strong>durenburger</strong>: Thank you, Mr. President. It certainly
is nice of you to be with us here today considering your busy schedule
and all.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, Don – it’s true that I have a busy
schedule. But I’ve got a feeling that when folks find out about your
five hundred dollar cash rebate on all `93 LeBaron and LeBaron
convertibles you’re gonna be even busier than I am.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Mommy, is that the President?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I sure hope not.</p>
<p><strong>angle - dave</strong>: He leans closer to Durenburger
continuing with the routine.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You know, Don, it’s not easy being President.
Why just the other day, I was riding on Air Force One…</p>
<p><strong>angle-dave</strong>: He stops the routine and squints out
toward the crowd while the WAILING CONTINUES. His parents try to comfort
the BOY but it doesn’t do any good.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey, hey… What’s the matter…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi… What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Don’t you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: … Sam.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi, Sam… You want a riddle?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay. What can run all day without getting
tired?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well come on, Sam. It’s not your jar…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My nose?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Right. !!!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Six-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Great, I’ll see you then.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hi, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi, …..</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It went great, Alice. I killed em down
there.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah? Why don’t you see what you *) can do in
here.</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: Dave turns around to see three
women stacked up in his waiting area.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No problem. What `ve we got?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Mabel says it’s too far on the bus.
Jennifer’s boss tried to hit on her again and Lola’s been crying in your
office for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Lola. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lola</strong>: Oh, Meester Kobic… Is no my fault… I learn on
de I.B.M okay? Then they make me work on de Wang… No puedo comprendar
esta machina…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s airight. We’ll find you something
else.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’ll get her something right now. Alice… Have
you seen my checkbook?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Dave, I’m your ex-wife. As in Ex E – X…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Bottom drawer next to your baseball
glove.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks. You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Dave, I can’t hire anybody else.</p>
<p>****: This woman’s amazing, Murray. She flies on an I.B.M…</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I don’t have enough work for the people you
gave me already.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She’s got three kids and the husband’s a
diabetic… Diabetic?</p>
<p><strong>lola</strong>: Si. Diabetico.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Short-term thing. Straight temp job.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So you want to go swimming?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Dave – I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh yeah… Me, too. You want to get dinner
later?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I was gonna do something with Joan.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh. Okay. I’ll catch ya tomorrow then.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘Oooooooooooooooooo…’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘… klahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down
the plain…’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: `Where the wavin’ wheat, can sure smell
sweet…’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘and the wind comes right behind the - …’</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Mr. Kovic?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I’m Duane Stavensen with the United States
Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: We’re with the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh my God… I thought it was a legitimate
deduction, I swear to God. See… I need a piano for my work
sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Mr. Kovic. We’re not here about your
taxes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Your government needs your help.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: On occasion for security purposes, to double
for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions
and exposed situations.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: We’d like to hire you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Johnny, you did it again!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You really cut his this short?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s a perfect match.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hunh. ’Cause I always thought it came over the
ears a little…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You understand what you’ll be doing?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah… You just want me to wave, right?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wave from the door… go down the stairs… get
into the limo…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: `Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,
if you wanted me to talk or…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t say a .</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Uh –Mr. Alexander?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Is this dangerous or anything?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No more than the usual.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The usual…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re all set, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What about the intro?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’ll be on the teleprompter with the rest of
the speech.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It better be. Last time you had me
introduce a dead guy.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Who’s this priest I’m thanking?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the
inauguration.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Oh yeah. Did you take care of later
on?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You know as I was coming in here tonight I
ran into Jordan Blankfort who I hadn’t seen for years…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And I couldn’thelp remembering back to the
time when Jordan and I were in law school together. … Now Jordan and I
were pretty wild back then and like most college students, we liked to
enjoy a few beers on occasion…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Get readY.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: God bless you… God bless America…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>wider angle</strong>: The President stares at him
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You are a very handsome man.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Just get rid of that grin. You look like a
schmuck.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hello America! God Bless you!</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: The car speeds away from the curb
with the motorcade behind it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sorry, I couldn’t help it. I just got carried
away… … I was really good though, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So I guess there must be something pretty
important going on for the President to go through all of this…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ahhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Bill?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Oh; shit…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It doesn’t look very good.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: They say it hit both sides of his brain… Even
if he makes it he’s gonna be a vegetable.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t believe he’d do this.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: She’s a little hysterical right now. We’ve got
her upstairs in a laundry room.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nightmare…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Look… at some point we’re going to have to
call the Vice President…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t call the Vice President!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: … What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just don’t call him, Alan!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The guy’s in a coma, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is mine, Al – all mine … I made him. I
built him. And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from
me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You know if you guys want to do something for
his birthday, I could come down to Washington. I have some great
birthday stuff…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I do this thing with the first lady – my
friends love it – it’s the two of them going away to Club Med…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p>****: What?.. Are you sure? What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s a temporary solution.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Till what?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: TilT we figure something out.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Bob, the guy had a stroke!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Look, everything can be handled. We’ll just
find a way to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Like how?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, start by going on television and saying
that he’s had a mild stroke…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Mild stroke?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around
sometime soon.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Up and around? Soon?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You know, I think I’ve been real cooperative
up until now but…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just tell me where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, my name is Alan Reed. I’m the White
House Communications Director. This is Bob Alexander, our Chief of
Staff. We met you earlier tonight at the hotel, remember?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or
something?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh yeah… 1’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Now, Dave, something has come up and I think
we need to talk about it…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Look, I’m sorry. I know you said not to talk,
but when I saw the crowd I just got excited…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re not upset with you, Dave. We think you
did a terrific job. Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: In fact, we think you did such a good job,
we’d like to extend things a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Extend things?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Extend them. C’mere for a second.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Try it out.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: Reed looks over at Bob, who nods at
him. He takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, something has happened to the
President.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I know… I know… It’s difficult for all of us.
But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on
the gQod of the country.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Well, it’s… It’s sort of an… an `incident’
really…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A condition…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Exactly. A condition.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’s actually kind of serious, Dave. I’m
afraid the President’s not in very good shape.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh my gosh…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Will he be alright?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh, yeah… probably…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We think so.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, we need our friends and even our enemies
to feel safe and secure… We need them to feel like they can go to bed at
night knowing President Mitchell is fully in control… We need them to
feel like he’s sitting right here in this chair…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey - - wait a second…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What about the Vice President?</p>
<p><strong>rted</strong>: Vice Presidant?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well… We didn’t want to have to get into this
but… … The Vice President is mentally unbalanced.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Really? Crazy?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Certifiable.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How much do you usually get paid?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Uh – I don’t know. Sometimes it’s just like a
barter thing… Is this legal?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave - - have you ever driven through a red
light?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You know, on an empty road where you know it’s
safe and nobody’s around…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m not sure… I might have.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Well, let’s say your mother was in the car and
you had to get her to a hospital. You’d do it then for sure wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well… I gues I would… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Now, let’s say the whole country. Was in that
car. The entire United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: In the car?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: In the car.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I see what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, the country is sick. And we’re gonna get
it to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - dave</strong>: He stares at them for a moment then
smiles slightly…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: These are the living quarters. The President’s
bedroom is on this side and the First Lady’s is over there.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Dave walks forward in awe.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: First Lady…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t worry. You won’t even see her.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They barely talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It happens. This is where you’ll be
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Holy cow.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’ll be back for you first thing tomorrow and
if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… Okay.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - dave</strong>: He breaks out into a “Presidential”
grin…</p>
<p><strong>int. “the cbs morning news” studio - full shot -
kathleen</strong>: SULLIVAN</p>
<p><strong>kathleen sullivan</strong>: … The White House now classifies
the President’s condition as a `slight circulatory problem of the
head.’</p>
<p><strong>kathleen sullivan</strong>: Although technically a stroke,
spokesmen say the President’s condition is far from serious and he ought
to be up and around sometime soon.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Do you know how many different kinds of laws
we’ve broken?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s simple, Alan. We send the Vice- President
to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and
get our `President’ to nominate a new one. The whole thing takes a few
weeks tops.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You mean we get `Dave’ to nominate you as Vice
President.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I was a senator, you know.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh, I know. And then when our poor President
gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the
newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What about containment, Alan?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and
the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that everybody?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Duane’s guys, but he’s got them under
control.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What about her.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Her?… Oh – the First Lady… She was giving that
commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr. I managed to catch her before she
left the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I told her his blood pressure went up after a
little incident at `the hotel.’ She seems to hate him more than
ever.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Everybody else is buying the minor stroke’
story…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I just hope this yutz can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, I must say, Mr. President, even for a
man with a mild stroke you seem to have made a remarkable recovery.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks. I’m feeling much better.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No signs of paralysis, no circulatory
changes. Your E.M.G. is completely normal and your blood pressure has
even gone down. Have you been exercising recently?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just the usual.. Watching the diet – A little
weight lifting… Some power talking…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, judging from these tests, I don’t see
any reason why you couldn’t start back to work within a couple of
days.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now, remember – keep it simple.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good morning, Clara…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Good morning, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good morning, Diane…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good morning, Randi…</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: She leans forward, grasping his
hand, desperately.</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Oh, good morning, Mr. President. I’m so
relieved that you’re alright. You really had me scared.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s with her?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: She’s just a little emotional – she feels kind
of attached to the President.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay, let’s go over it again. You met a girl,
you fell in love…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And we’re going away for a holiday.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: For a month.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: A month.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right and don’t embellish.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I promise. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I couldn’t believe it. As soon as we sit down
he pulls out this ring… … Oh I know - -I just got so emotional. The
waiter had to bring me another napkin.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hang on. Kovic Temps Dave! Where are you? You
met who?.., You’re going where? Cancun.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, that’s fine… No, I think it’s great..,
Sure, I understand I will… Okay… ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s in love Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>sander vanocur</strong>: The President continued his
convalescence, resting in the white House for the second straight day.
His personal physician pronounced him in perfectly good health…</p>
<p><strong>president’ s physician</strong>: I’ve examined him thoroughly
and I must say, I don’t think I’ve ever seen the President in better
shape.</p>
<p><strong>sander vanocur</strong>: The President was able to attend to
Some official business on Wednesday, and continues to be briefed on all
areas of national concern…</p>
<p><strong>sander vanocur</strong>: So confident was the white House in
the President’s recovery, that they have just sent the Vice President on
a twelve nation African goodwill tour… This is Sander Vanocur at the
white House.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: First thing we’re gonna work on is the
mannerisms. Alan has put together sort of a training program</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at
first. You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some
trouble getting used to…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: A teleprompter.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: As I was saying, no one expects you to be Bill
Mitchell overnight.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Presence.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Right. Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the
President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: At a press conference.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s at a press conference. Otherwise he
just puts `em right out there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m not certain about…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘An America stronger than the one we were
given. An America prouder than the one we found.’ He has ’em right there
on the side.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You know that’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, I loved that speech.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Thanks, I wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding
us through this rocky shoal…’</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘America isn’t in what we say here tonight –
it’s in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon…’ Hand on the
heart…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dave…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s in the little leaguer who may strike out
but knows in his heart that at least swung… Hands to the side…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: ‘… It’s in the gentle kindness of the family
kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down…’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So when do we start?</p>
<p><strong>andrea mitchell</strong>: Tom, virtually every reporter in
Washington is camped out here awaiting the President’s first appearance
since his Stroke…</p>
<p><strong>andrea mitchell</strong>: Even though some may find his
recovery amazing, White House officials claim they never expected less
from a man who always expects so much from himself.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I thought you said I wasn’t going to see
her.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’s just five minutes. She comes in. You wave
to the press. She leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah, but the First Lady… Couldn’t we start
with a cousin or something?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: She hardly ever sees him and it’ll be so fast,
she won’t have a chance to tell.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Be a professional. If you can convince her - -
you can convince anybody.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … Alright.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now when she comes in, we’ll move you right out
to the balcony. All you have to say is `thanks for doing this,
Ellen.’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.’</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Exactly. She doesn’t always like this stuff
and it might soften her up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why can’t you die from a stroke like
everybody else?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What are you staring at?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re Gonna do it right out here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Who was it, Bill? A Secretary?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks for doing this, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Go tuck yourself, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, perhaps we can get started now.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: And you can tell those two pit vipers this is
the last one of these I’ll be doing for a while.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Smile!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Wave!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: How do you feel, Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>yellow room</strong>: Bob and Reed are huddled beside the
window.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Ready to go back to work?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Don’t you have anything to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks for doing this, Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You don’t change, do you, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She hates me.</p>
<p><strong>bob &amp; reed</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Duane?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … Can I get a bite? I’m kinda hungry.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You gotta try this. It’s my special
sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Everybody loves this sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>(beat) duane</strong>: What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, that’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So, how long have they been like that - - you
know, him and the First Lady?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You mean you don’t know or like – you can’t
say.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So you just protect the President the whole
time? That’s your whole job?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You got a gun?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ave</strong>: Can I See it?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Well, it’s really not policy to…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You ever use it?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Huh. You know what I always wondered the way
they say you guys’d take a bullet for the President.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, is that really true? I mean, would you
really get killed just to save his life.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So that means, now you’d get killed for me
too?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Here. Try this.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Clean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you mean, he’s clean?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I mean I’ve checked everything. Women. Liquor…
Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student
body president.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No one gets to be Vice President by being that
clean.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The guy’s a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared
frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What about the wife?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Clean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Check his kids.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Clean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nobody’s got clean kids.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’ve got nothing, Bob. This won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make
something up. Instead of a couple weeks it’ll be a couple of months. The
whole thing is under control.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You think we can keep this thing going for a
couple of months!</p>
<p><strong>distinguished man</strong>: Bob… Alan… Your boy sure looks
great. I think he sounds even better’n he did before this stroke.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, thanks very much, Judge. We’ll tell him
you sent your best.</p>
<p><strong>distinguished man</strong>: You take care, now.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, you, too.</p>
<p><strong>gm president</strong>: Now this man is using a robotic
mechanism for picking up the engine. The large arms that you see
duplicate all of his arm movements exactly, so it’s as if he’s lifting
two thousand pounds.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Can I try it?</p>
<p><strong>gm president</strong>: Huh? Uh, well…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I mean, if it’s a problem…</p>
<p><strong>gm president</strong>: No, no. It’s really quite simple. Just
come on over here.</p>
<p><strong>gm president</strong>: Now, you slip your hands into these
sleeves here…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I once caught a fish this big.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s a soundbite machine…</p>
<p><strong>gergen</strong>: I don’t know about you, Mark, but I don’t
think I’ve ever seen the President as relaxed or comfortable with
himself as he is right now.</p>
<p><strong>shields</strong>: Oh, I agree, David. I don’t know who gave
him happy pills but this is a pretty unbelievable transformation.</p>
<p><strong>gergen</strong>: Well, I think it’s a kind of ‘rebirth’
really. This is a man who’s stared death in the face and it’s obviously
had a profound effect on him.</p>
<p><strong>shields</strong>: Look, if that’s what a stroke’ll do for ya,
I’ll take a couple of dozen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>leno</strong>: How ’bout the President these days huh? One
minute he has a stroke the next he’s doing push-ups. Must make it a lot
easier on the Secret Service when all they have to worry about is
Kryptonite.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay – first we’re gonna hear from Ted on the
land management legislation…</p>
<p><strong>angle - dave</strong>: He stares at the photograph of “him”
and Ellen, reliving a history that he never experienced.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re misinterpreting it, Nathan – that’s
not what the study said. It said if the mother got less than 1100
calories the child would risk a low birthrate…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Nathan?… Hang on a second. Will you turn that
thing up?</p>
<p><strong>mclaughlin</strong>: Issue One: ‘The New Bill Mitchell.’ Two
weeks after his brush with death the President is suddenly bounding
around the country with the energy of a high school track star. Is this
merely overcompensation or the indefatigable greatness of a truly great
man. Mor-ton…</p>
<p><strong>mort kondracke</strong>: Well, he looks pretty great to me. I
think the President is showing the same strength of character he did
when he first got elected.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor clift</strong>: You know, Mort, every time this guy
has a blip in the polls you start genuflecting…</p>
<p><strong>mort kondracke</strong>: Hey – I think he looks great.</p>
<p><strong>chris mathews</strong>: Yeah, he looks great ‘cause they’re
makin’ him look great. This puppet show at the auto plant was the most
manipulative piece of political theater I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>fred barnes</strong>: Oh, come on, Chris. You’re just steamed
’cause he’s doing well.</p>
<p><strong>chris mathews</strong>: I am not…</p>
<p><strong>fred barnes</strong>: Is he doing well?</p>
<p><strong>chris mathews</strong>: Well… Yeah… He’s doing well…</p>
<p><strong>mclaughlin</strong>: Answer: He’s doing very well. We’ll get
to predictions right after this.</p>
<p><strong>public address announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen,
throwing out the ceremonial first pitch… The President of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: We’re back with Oliver Stone, talking
about what seems like a pretty far- fetched theory…</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Oliver Stone sits across the desk.</p>
<p><strong>oliver stone</strong>: There’s something going on here,
Larry, and no one is telling us the truth.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: Oliver, the guy had a little stroke.
He’s enjoying life a little…</p>
<p><strong>oliver stone</strong>: If you look at a photograph of Bill
Mitchell before the stroke, and another one right after…</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: Aren’t you being a little paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>oliver stone</strong>: Have you compared the photographs?</p>
<p><strong>following dave</strong>: Dave reaches the open doorway and
slides quickly against the wall. Slowly, carefully he bends his head and
peeks into the room.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, let’s see… you can have him on Tuesday
the 25th…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh, let me get back to you…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You scheduled a whole day with the First
Lady?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’s a homeless shelter.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’s gonna be great. ‘Caring about his wife.’
‘Spending time on her favorite issue…’</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t want him caring about his wife! What
about the Vice President!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost
got nailed on?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I just dumped it on him instead.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When does it break?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Couple of days. Anyhow, look at these tracking
polls, they’ll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with
seniors, eighty- four with working mothers…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alan, we still have to control this guy…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: And look at this. Russell came around on the
trade bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: How long have you been waiting to pass that
thing?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m telling you, Bob, it’s a gift. When you
got a Ferrari you don’t leave it in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why are you doing this, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Since when do you care about the
homeless?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I care about the homeless.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah. I’m sure it’s keeping you up
nights.</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: Their eyes lock for a moment. Dave smiles
quickly and glances out the window. Ellen looks down at her own leg a
little puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, it’s straight klick and smile but
there’s a great visual in the kitchen so make sure you stop at the
soup.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: One of the things they’re trying to do here
at Helping Hand, is keep verbal skills alive. The first thing that goes
with these kids is their ability to communicate and they need to get to
them before this happens.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You like cartoons?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Could you just stop that for a second.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You like Tweety Bird?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So, which one do you like?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sylvester.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sylvester?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But he’s a cat.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Gimme a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Quick. Gimme a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay - - what can run all day without getting
tired.</p>
<p>****: Well, it’s not your ear.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: My nose?</p>
<p><strong>koppel</strong>: What makes a man rise to a particular moment
in history? What makes a man in the thicket of middle age, suddenly
rediscover himself with the wonder of a child.</p>
<p><strong>koppel</strong>: Later on tonight, we’ll talk with Dr. Henry
Mueller who is an expert in the psychological effects of a mid-life
health crisis… and to Gail Sheehy, who has just co-authored a book on
male menopause.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: `Bum, bum da dum…’</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I can’t believe you’d do something like that.
Not even you.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: The door to the shower swings open as Ellen
materializes. No queen of England ever looked more regal than Ellen
Mitchell in her cloud of steam.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: How could you?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … How could I what?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, come on, Bill. Don’t patronize me. I’m
not one of your little… Turn around. I’m talking to you!…
Turnaround!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: … You know, if you want to be the same old
bastard, that’s fine. I can handle it. But don’t pull this ‘man of the
people’ bullshit and then do something like this.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That’s not just a works bill you vetoed –
that would have given these kids homes… … When I think about that little
spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s wrong with a magic trick?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You made their funding disappear!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Look. If there was some mistake…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: There’s no mistake, Bill. If you veto their
funding, it’s not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it’s not
a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need them
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: But it’s ten-thirty at night.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Yeah, sure. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What the hell is this ?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The Washington Post.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: President vetoes works bill?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: We vetoed that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No!… WE didn’t anything…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, these things get awfully complicated
sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That shelter was in this bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alan</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Lots of shelters were in this bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: ) Listen, you little…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Dave, the budget’s a very complicated thing.
Even I don’t understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make
some cuts and…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But we went there. We saw those kids.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah. And if you can find a way to cut THREE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS from the federal budget, then you can
keep your lousy shelters, okay.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I’m here to see… the President?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: He asked me to come.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I’m serious, Dave – you could get in a lot
of trouble for something like this.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: They could put you in jail.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why would they do that. They hired me.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s kind of a national emergency thing. I
can’t really talk about it… Paying me big money too. C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>angle - murray</strong>: He looks at it wide-eyed, frozen by
what he sees.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Are we being taped?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t think so</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: This is undeclared income.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And who’s gonna find out?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: The government</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I am the government.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I know – kind of wild, huh? Let’s get to
work.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I gotta tell ya, Dave. I’ve been going over
this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn’t add up. Who
does these books?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I gotta tell ya, Dave. I’ve been going over
this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn’t add up. Who
does these books?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I just think they make this stuff a lot more
complicated than it has to be.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m not surprised. Can we save anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some
choices.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Choices?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: You know – priorities. Remember when you
couldn’t get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You could buy it on payments.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Yeah. That’s how you end up with a 400
billion dollar deficit.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Well, there’s lots of places where I think
you can save, but I’m not the one who’s ……. I mean, I’m not the one
who’s not the Pres…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s alright. I know what you mean. Let’s
start at the top.</p>
<p><strong>closer angle</strong>: Bob sits down next to Reed unfolding a
copy of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Its a work of art. Look at this thing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: `Vice President’s office linked to First
Liberty scandal. Justice Department may investigate.’ Alan, you’re a
genius – we’re on our way!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s with the cameras?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a
nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>angle - doorway</strong>: Dave enters suddenly, moving
quickly into the room. He nods to the various staff members, crossing to
his seat.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good morning, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>cabinet</strong>: Good morning, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Before we get started today there are a few
things I’d like to go over in the budget.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do we have anything on the budget today?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>angle - dave</strong>: He clutches one of the 3 x 5 cards in
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Now I think I’ve found some ways to put back
the homeless section of the Simpson Garner works bill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uh, Mr. President… I don’t believe that’s on
your agenda today.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well it’s a last minute change.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The way I see it we need three hundred and
fifty million dollars in order to keep the program. Now some of this can
be achieved through some simple changes in cash management. For
example…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: According to the O.M.B. we have seventeen
defense contractors who are delinquent in their contracts. Is that
true?</p>
<p><strong>director of o.m.b.</strong>: Uh… I believe so… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So even though they’re late, we keep paying
them on time?</p>
<p><strong>director of o.m.b.</strong>: Well – in a sense… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Now instead of giving them money for something
they haven’t finished, we could hold back that cash, put it aside in
some interest bearing…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mr. President!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: .. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Like I was saying, if we took that cash and
stuck it in even an ordinary savings account, we’d be making twelve
million a month in interest.</p>
<p><strong>secretary of treasury</strong>: Well, technically that’s
true…</p>
<p><strong>secretary of treasury</strong>: Yes. Yes, I suppose that’s
true.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But unfortunately, money management only gets
us halfway to our goal. To find the rest of the money, we’re going to
have to start making some choices - - some pretty tough choices…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Choices???</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yes, Bob. Choices… Now the Commerce
Department..,</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: Yes, Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You’re spending forty-three million dollars on
an ad campaign to… ‘Boost consumer confidence in the American auto
industry.’</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: And it’s proving quite
effective…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Does it make the cars any better?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: No, sir. It’s more of a
perceptual issue.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Perceptual?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: Yes, it’s designed to bolster
individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: Well… to shore up product
identification and preserve market share.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So we’re spending forty-seven million dollars
to make people feel better about a car they’ve already bought?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: Yes, but I wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well I’m sure that’s really important, but I
don’t want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the
street because we want people to feel better about their cars. Do you
want to tell him that?</p>
<p><strong>secretary of commerce</strong>: Me? Uh, no sir… I sure
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>angle - dave</strong>: He pulls out a pen and jots down a
figure…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Good. That gives us another forty- seven
million. Now the Postal Service…</p>
<p><strong>postmaster general</strong>: Yes, Mr. President!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay, so that makes… … Two, eighty-four, carry
the three… … Three hundred and fifty-six million. … And that means we
can keep the program.</p>
<p><strong>various cabinet members</strong>: Wonderful job, sir…
Fantastic, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m going to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You can’t kill a President.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s not a President! He’s an ordinary person.
I can kill an ordinary person.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s only doing what you told him to.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What I told him to?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I heard you. You said ‘cut three hundred
million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless
shelter.’</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, I didn’t mean it, Alan. Why the fuck
would I want to save a homeless shelter?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He was only doing his job.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: His job? His job!!!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s not his job – It’s my job!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral
Commission? Was he in Who’s Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles
him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free. I’ll destroy him,
Alan. I’ll shred the bastard!!!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll lock him away for good.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Then we’ll all go to jail together.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Just what you think I mean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you threatening me?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sort of… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: You won’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: `Saves homeless plan’?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks. You did great. Maybe later you could
come back and we could go to Camp David or something.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: That’d be great.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well – take care.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Yeah. Don’t get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>wider angle</strong>: He throws the car into gear and starts
down the long, bending driveway toward the gate. Dave watches from the
edge of the lawn with a fond look on his face…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Gin.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I was waiting for that jack.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I had a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>(beat) dave</strong>: How come you went along with all of
this?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: You mean with you and everything?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: `Bleed for your king.’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: First thing they teach you at the academy.
`Don’t give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride
and glory of bleeding for my King.’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: No… They don’t kid.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But Bill was your king, not Bob.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in
Firearms and Tobacco…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: We’re trained to be loyal. You gotta be loyal
to someone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Didn’t mean to bum you out.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: That’s okay. You alright down here by
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh, sure. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … . Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I saw the light. I thought maybe you were
up.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That was quite a thing you did today.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Anybody would have done it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, I don’t think so. Still, you helped a lot
of people.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back
in the state legislature.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh yeah? Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You weren’t in the state legislature.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m Ellen Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look, I’ll make this easy on you. I never see
him anymore. I barely know him anymore. I’d just kinda like to. know
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I mean, what is it? Another Secretary? A
jaunt to the Bahamas with Some ‘campaign worker.’ Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I really shouldn’t be doing this.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Just open it, please.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry, you’re not allowed…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Alexander left strict…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: It’s the stroke. It’s pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I don’t understand. Is he, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Don’t touch me, please.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: When were you all planning to tell me? A year
from now? After the election… What’s going on here? Dave hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: They asked me to help.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m sure they did. ‘State of Emergency.’
‘National Security.’ You ever hear of the Constitution?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Could all of you just leave me alone for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m really not supposed to…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn’t
be here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Where’s home?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, they didn’t brief you on that? How sloppy
of them.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You1re leaving, too?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact… I
even thought I was helping.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey… It’s…</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: Ellen is crying. She shakes her
head and turns away from him.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You know you make this little deal with
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You can put up with the other women and you
can do without a life because you believe in what you’re doing - - and
if you can just keep your mouth shut…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You thought you had a chance to help
people…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: How were you gonna get home?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I don’t know. I hadn’t thought it out that
far.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You sure this goes somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Truman used it all the time.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You don’t have to keep walking with me. I’m
okay from here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>closer shot</strong>: Dave and Ellen emerge stepping out onto
the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Duane said he’d leave the car over here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: He said he’ll pick it up in a couple of
days.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh… Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s just so strange…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I lock at you and I see Bill… I mean, he’s
almost dead, but he’s right here… I mean, you’re right here… alive
and…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m not Bill Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: In fact, I’m not anything like him and… I
guess I want you to know that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: He wasn’t always like that, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m starving. There’s got to be something open
around here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I really don’t have much of an appetite.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: This is good. What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You have a lot of secrets.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: When did you know?… About me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I think in the car.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The car?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: On the way to the homeless shelter. You
looked at my leg. Bill lost interest a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s good. I was worried it was the
shower.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: So what do you do the rest of the time?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You mean when I’m not running the country?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I run a temp agency.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You know, secretaries and stiff.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You find people jobs?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah. Is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s just more than anybody else does around
here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well don’t get carried away – I’m not that
good at it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: And your family? I assume you’re married?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I was… once. It didn’t take.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You know, Dave – it is Dave, isn’t it? I
can’t keep all of this a secret.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: But you could go to jail for it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I liked doing it, though. Not the fancy stuff
with the helicopter or the TV cameras but…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I liked saving that shelter. I liked helping
people I hadn’t even met before.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And right then I felt like I wasn’t pretending
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I don’t think you were pretending.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I liked being married to you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What would you do if you were still in there?
If you had one more chance to be President, what would you do then?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. There’s no visitors…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mr. President! I’m sorry I…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just getting some air.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Certainly, sir… How did…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The President wanted some ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: … You make a nice President, Dave Kovic.. .
go for it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Bet it’s that Fidelity thing.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Think they’re gonna ditch the Veep?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: He’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Toast.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I didn’t call it. He called it himself… I
swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: … Jackson is the figure that you see
represented in the lower left hand… Why there’s Bob Alexander our White
House Chief of Staff…</p>
<p><strong>angle - bob</strong>: He comes careening into the foyer,
skittering across the polished marble.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: … My, he seems to be in quite a hurry…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You mean the press conference? I have a couple
of ideas I wanted to share with the country.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Share…</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Dave rises from the couch as Bob moves over
to him with his eyes blazing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You don’t call a press conference. I call a
press conference!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re nothing. Do you understand me! You’re
NOBODY…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m… not… nobody…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re lint! You’re a flea! You’re a blip!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, maybe I am. But you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … what?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I said you’re fired. Go on – get outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh… I’m fired?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fine?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You got the whole Press Corps out there. Why
don’t you just go tell ’em.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Go on. Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: They stare at each other for a long moment.
Neither man moves as they stand toe to toe in the center of the carpet.
For a second, it isn’t clear who’s going to win, until…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Darling…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Darling, they’re all waiting for you in the
Press Room - - you’ve really got to get going… Oh, Bob… I’m sorry,
darling. I thought you were alone - -</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’d like your resignation on my desk by the
time I get back.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - bob</strong>: He looks at them stunned and
defeated…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks for coming on such short notice.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Reed stands off to the side with an almost
mesmerized look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: First, I’d like to announce something that
might come as a surprise to many of you. I’ve asked Bob Alexander to
resign as White House Chief of Staff.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sometimes, two people just change and it’s
better for everybody if they go their Own way. Over the last few months!
Bob and I have come to believe in different things. He thinks this
country is fine and we should go about doing business as usual. I just
don’t feel that way. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Because things aren’t fine. And you know that
and I know that. And we can keep lying to ourselves, but it’s a little
late for that. We’ve got water we can’t drink and air we can’t breathe.
We’ve got bars on. our windows and graffiti on our doors. If you get
sick you can’t afford to go to the doctor and if you get laid off you
can’t find a new job. We’re trillions of dollar in debt. Our roads are
cracking, our bridges are crumbling and everything we used to build is
made in Japan. We’ve got people sleeping in cardboard boxes, and ten-
year-old kids who are doing drugs. We’ve been living together for four
hundred years, and we’re still trying to kill each other… But that isn’t
even the worst part. The worst part is we feel like we can’t do anything
about it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So I’ve decided that while I’m President, I
should actually try to do things… even if they seem impossible.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: First off I’m initiating a program to try to
find a decent job for every American who wants one.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why start here? Because if you’ve ever seen
the look on someone’s face the day they get a job – I’ve had some
personal experience with this - - they look like they could fly. And
unless we start tapping into that kind of spirit again, there’s no way
we’re gonna fix anything in this country.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So… Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Mr. President… Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It was okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It was inspirational.</p>
<p><strong>nina totenberg</strong>: In the boldest initiative yet of the
`New Bill Mitchell’ presidency, the President has proposed a
comprehensive full employment program, unparalleled since the days of
F.D.R.</p>
<p><strong>quick cut</strong>: TO:</p>
<p><strong>novack</strong>: … It’s naive, it’s dangerous, it’s
irresponsible…</p>
<p><strong>mathews</strong>: … It’s courageous, it’s challenging, it’s
visionary…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>mark shields</strong>: It’s brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>john mclaughlin</strong>: If the President wants to run
around proposing lame-brained schemes like this one…</p>
<p><strong>michael kinsely</strong>: Well he’s certainly got my
vote.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thank God for that.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Let’s call it a night. I can’t take any
more.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Right. We can pick up on the rest
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ellen’s aide</strong>: I’ll have those employment figures to
you by eight-thirty…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: And we’ve got that labor briefing at nine.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well I guess…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah… Bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I know. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I mean, I want to… I just, I feel
strange…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: This is crazy…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: The U.S. News hammered us. But they’re always
tough on that kind of thing. Rosenthal loved us in the Times</p>
<p><strong>randi</strong>: Mr. President, Mr. Nance is waiting inside
for you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: The Vice-President…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… right… You know, ever since the
stroke…</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: This is from the people of Burundi…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: And these are a gift from the King of To
go.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Fertility beads.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Mr. President, may I speak frankly with
you?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - nance</strong>: He hesitates for a moment. Nance
gathers his thoughts,then proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: I know we haven’t always gotten along. I know
we’ve disagreed politically and I suppose I know what you think of me
personally…</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: … But I’ve always tried to respect the role
you wanted me to play. When I’ve disagreed with this administration I’ve
kept it to myself. When you wanted my support you always had it.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Dammit, Bill – how could you do something
like this to me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Something like what…</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Oh, come on, we’re not children. I didn’t
have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The Fidelity nonsense…</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: All I’ve got is my integrity. That’s all I
have. Now I don’t know why you turned your attack dogs on me.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: They re not my attack dogs.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I just fired Bob Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What do you mean you made it all up?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We had to, Dave. The guy’s a choir boy.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: This is wrong, Alan!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Wrong…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Alan…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh, I know, I know… It looks awfully bad. It’s
really embarrassing. But it was Bob’s idea.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: We’ve got to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Absolutely. Well, that might be kind of tough.
Once the press starts smelling blood…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Dave…</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: She flies into the room with a worried look
on her face. Dave and Reed watch while she heads toward the “media
center” in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: `Dave’?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She knows.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>nina totenberg</strong>: … The hastily called news conference
at the National Press Club was Bob Alexander’s first public comment
since resigning as White House Chief of Staff. It turned out to be
nothing short of a full-fledged salvo fired directly at Pennsylvania
Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When I first began to look into the allegations
concerning Fidelity Savings and Loan, I thought the wrongdoing was
restricted to the Vice President’s office…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … But as I began to investigate, I realized
that this pattern of corruption extended much higher…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>tv screen</strong>: Bob pauses for an effect, then looks
straight into the camera:</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … I was saddened to discover at least fifteen
separate acts of intervention by this administration, most with the full
knowledge of the President and all of them illegal. Federal regulators
were influenced, records were destroyed, and pressure was brought to
bear, in same cases by President Mitchell himself.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Now he’s making stuff up about me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s not.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: He’s not making it up.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Bob never left Bill’s side. He knows where
all the old bones are buried…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. President, I don’t know another way to
put it, but ‘This dawg just won’t hunt.’</p>
<p><strong>maj. leader</strong>: We may be able to hold off this First
Liberty thing for a little while1 but if you go running around the
country with this new jobs idea…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: They’re gonna put us on a spit an’ bring in
the sauce.</p>
<p><strong>female senator</strong>: If you just waited for a little
while…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t want to wait for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Mr. President, I understand that. But
sometimes ya fight an’ sometimes ya run.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That’s not what you said during your ethics
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Every eye in the room turns toward her. The
Speaker stares daggers across the table.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: When you needed the President’s help, you got
it.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Ma’am, no one appreciates your husband’s
help more’n me. I’m just saying that this jobs thing is a little
unwieldy…’</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: It is not.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: There’s lots of ways to make it work. You
could have targeted tax credits for on-site training… You could have a
public private partnership like - J.T.P.A…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Excuse me for interruptin’ but this ain’t
some city council silliness that’s gonna blow over. We’re talking about
obstructing federal regulators and violating election up on the Hill who
are talkin’ impeachment. We got a real problem on our hands.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … At least fifteen separate acts of
intervention by this administration, most with full knowledge of the
President..</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Guess they’re coming at you now, too.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Dirty business we’re in sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: He’s not gonna win – not in the end… They
never do.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … Sometimes they do.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Yeah… Sometimes they do.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Mr. President, whatever happens I just wanted
you to know that I think that your jobs program is a wonderful idea…</p>
<p><strong>dave,</strong>: Not that anyone’s gonna pay much attention
now… But thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Want to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You ever think back to how you started.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You know. Your first campaign.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: Yeah… .. I was a shoe salesman. and not very
happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: One day my wife says to me ‘Why don’t you try
running for office. You talk about it all the time, why don’t you just
do it?’ So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to
the registrar of voters on my lunch break. Next thing I know, I’m a
councilman.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two
thousand dollar budget.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: With advertising.</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: How’d you get started?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh… Kinda the same way.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Looks like we’re not going to get a chance to
get much done.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: They’re crucifying you out there.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you
do a little and I do a little… then maybe the next guy’ll do a
little…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah. And it’s better than not believing it
Their faces are inches apart.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I sure fall for some weird guys.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Nance is a good man, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah. He’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m just getting to know you – I don’t want
to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>slowly</strong>: DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p><strong>sander vanocur</strong>: The President has requested this
rare joint session of Congress so that he could personally answer the
allegations raised by Bob Alexander, his former Chief of Staff…</p>
<p><strong>sander vanocur</strong>: Speculation on the President’s
response has run the gamut from a full-fledged denial right up to the
possibility that he might resign.</p>
<p><strong>guest #1</strong>: Here’s to you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>guest #2</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let’s wait for the speech first. Don’t want to
get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Is everything clear with Duane?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: And this is all of it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well – here we go.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Relax, Alan… Enjoy the moment.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Mr. Speaker… The President of the
United States.</p>
<p><strong>wider angle</strong>: The response is more of a murmur than
the usual applause. Dave appears at the back of the Chamber carrying the
black briefcase. He makes his way up the aisle and mounts the five steps
that lead to the podium.</p>
<p><strong>shot - dave</strong>: He reaches the lectern and glances
behind him. Dave locks eyes with Vice President Nance for a moment,
flashing him a smile.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Shhh shh… Here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thank you. I wish I could be here today under
different circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: There’s certainly a lot of things about this
country that we should be discussing, but I realize that’s not possible
now. As all of you know, my former Chief of Staff has implicated me in a
scandal involving Fidelity Savings and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … And once people start talking about scandal
it’s hard for them to talk about anything else.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So fine. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Bob Alexander has accused me of… Let me read
this to make sure I get it right…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: …. Illegally influencing government regulators
on behalf of major campaign contributors – interfering with an ongoing
Justice Department investigation - - and violating Federal election laws
in the area of campaign finance.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay – let’s get right to the guts of it… Each
one of these charges is absolutely true.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Die, you pond scum!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m the President and as they say ‘The buck
stops here.’ So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal
acts.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But you see that’s not the whole story, and I
think each one of you is entitled to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I have written proof here in the form of…
Notes, memoranda and personal directives’ proving that Bob Alexander was
involved in each one of these incidents and in most cases planned them
as well…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alan…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Now - - allegations of wrong-doing have also
been made against Vice President Nance… I’m afraid that’s just a
lie.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … As this evidence will show… At no time and
in no way was Vice President Nance involved in any of this affair. Bob
made all of that up.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Vice president Nance is a good and decent
public servant and I’d like to apologize for any pain this may have
caused him or his family. And while we’re setting the record straight,
I’d also like to apologize to the American people…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … I forgot that I was hired to do a job for
you and that it was just a temp job at that. I forgot that I had two
hundred and fifty million people who were paying me to make their lives
a little better and I didn’t live up to my part of the bargain.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: See, there are certain things you should
expect from a President. I ought to care more about you than I do about
me… I ought to care more about what’s right than I do about what’s
popular…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I ought to be willing to give this whole thing
up for something I believe in…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Because if I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: If I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: If I’m not… Then I don’t belong here in the
first place…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: A doctor! We need a doctor… He’s had a
stroke!</p>
<p><strong>different angle</strong>: They pop the door of the ambulance.
A crowd of onlookers watches in horror as the body of the President is
whisked into the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: You sure you don’t want a lift back home?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No thanks. It’s not that far.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Dave…</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I would have taken a bullet for I you,
Dave.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Thanks, Duane.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: … The stroke hit at 8:42 p.m. just as the
President was concluding his remarks to a joint session of Congress.
Spokesmen at Bethesda Naval Hospital confirm that it was a `massive
edema’ and unlike his previous stroke, it has rendered the President
totally incapacitated… … Vice President Nance has already been conferred
with full executive authority and has assumed the Presidency in
accordance with the 24th Amendment. This is the first time since…</p>
<p><strong>nance</strong>: … I plan to continue Bill Mitchell’s call to
arms. This isn’t my Presidency – this is his Presidency and I can’t
think of a better legacy for him to leave than…</p>
<p><strong>announcer #3</strong>: … Bob Alexander and eight other
members of the Mitchell Administration were indicted on thirty-four
counts of election law violations and obstruction of justice.
Ironically, the indictments came just forty-eight hours after final
passage of the Bill Mitchell Jobs Bill, a comprehensive employment
program, designed to…</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: No. Fold them the long way. It looks
neater.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What do you mean, Harry, this woman’s
fabulous… Oh no, that was a different one… Well she’s changed a lot…
Come on, Harry, it’s Christmas, the woman needs a job. Well, sure… she
can wrap presents… Yeah you bet… Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Harry, did you get that fund-raising thing I
sent you?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yes! We’re on a roll now…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s Christmas time…</p>
<p><strong>dave i murray</strong>: …. and everybody works at Christmas
time…’</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: ) Thought I needed a little change. You like
it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I saw you on T.V… at his funeral.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah, well… It’s finally over.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I never thought I’d…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I missed…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: … Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: So this is it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: … Not exactly the Oval Office.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh… I lived with a President. It isn’t any
fun.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: It could be fun.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah… It could be fun.</p>
