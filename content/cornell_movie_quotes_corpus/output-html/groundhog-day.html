<h1 id="groundhog-day">groundhog-day</h1>
<p><strong>hibernating groundhogs</strong>: A family of groundhogs is
nestled together in their burrow sleeping off the end of a long
winter.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: Christ, what a pit. Phil” The sleeping
figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley. It’s Phil, the .Channel 9
Action News weatherman.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: It’s February first, Phil. You know what
tomorrow is? Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He’s in his mid-thirties,
smart, rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but clearly
a guy with a lot of personality.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, no! Not again. He jumps up and exits the
office with Hawley right behind him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Forget it! I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Get away from me. I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: So what’s the outlook? We gonna get that
blizzard? Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
“Phil’s Phorecast” with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the
title.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No way. All that moisture coming up from the
Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: Good, ’cause you’re going up to Punxsutawney
to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and I want you back here
in time to do the five.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will you! I
covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the year before that.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: And you’ll do it :next year and the year
after, too. When I worked in San Diego, I covered the swallows coming
back to Capistrano for ten years in a row.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You should’ve killed the guy who made you do
that.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: I wanted to do it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Then you should’ve killed yourself. I don’t
want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: It’s a cute story. He comes out, he looks
around, he wrinkles up his little nose, he sniffs around a little, he
sees his shadow, he d oesn’t see his shadow– it’s nice. People like
it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Many people are morons.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’11 you give me? Hawley looks across the
studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a very attractive segment producer in
her late twenties.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: I’ll give you Rita. Rita, could you come
here for a second? I got a little job for you. Rita is relatively new to
the station, but very competent, personable, humorous, self-assured and
very pretty– in short, a genuine princess, though Phil is too
self-absorbed at this point to realize it.</p>
<p>****: You can’t send Rita out on a story like this. She’s just a cub,
a pup, still wet behind the ears. Look at her. Her ears are sopping wet.
This needs a Woodward or a Bernstein. It’s a big story. People need to
know.</p>
<p>****: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: The Punxsutawney Groundhog Festival.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Gil, if it’s all right with you I ’ d rather
follow-up on the nurses’ strike.</p>
<p><strong>hawley</strong>: You can do the nurses when you get back.
Just take the squeaky wheel here up to Punxsutawney and get him back in
one piece. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah, okay. Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita
alone in the studio. She knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it
isn’t good. Still, she finds him appealing in an odd way.</p>
<p>****: You know, this could be extremely interesting.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ve never done a weather story before. What’s
Punxsutawney like?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, it’s an enchanted place. A magical world.
It’s the Constantinople of the whole Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
Drainage system.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Do you always joke?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: About 70 to 80% of the time. Inside I’m
actually a very shy and sensitive person.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: A lot of people around here think you’re not
very sincere.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tell me the names of these people.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll line up a crew and transportation. If you
don’t feel like driving, we can all go up in the van together.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think I’ll take my own car. I ’ m not that
fond of my fellow man.</p>
<p>****: Nice attitude.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nice face. Why don’t you ride up with me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, thanks. STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an
attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired correspondent, glares at Phil from
across the studio.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They don’t really think of me as a weatherman
around here. More of a “personality,” but with the credibility of a
first-class broadcast journalist. Once you look at my tape I think
you’ll see what they mean. Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway
looking at Phil for a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center
about this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
scary.</p>
<p>****: I just want to know one thing: did I do something wrong or are
you just tired of me or what? I have to know. Phil sighs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Dan, can I call you back? I’ve just been
handed something and I better get on it… papers and rustles …Okay,
thanks.</p>
<p>****: You didn’t do anything wrong, Stephanie, and I ’ m not tired of
you. It’s just that I don’t have time for a real relationship right now.
I told you that the first time we went out.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Everybody says that at the beginning of a
relationship.</p>
<p>****: I’m different. I really meant it! Things are really starting to
move for me now. I ’ m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of
my life. I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job. I want
that. This is just the beginning for me. I can’t waste any more
time.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Are you saying our relationship was a
waste of time?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Our relationship? We went out a total of four
times! And only twice did anything happen. It was fun but I don’t see
that as a big commitment.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: I had our charts done. My astrologer says
we’re extremely compatible. There may even be some past lives
involvement here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: See? So we’ve already done this. Let’s move
on. Next case.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: You know what’s wrong with you, Phil?
You’re selfish. You don’t have time for anyone but yourself.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s what I ’ m trying to tell you. You
don’t want to be with me. You can do better. Look, Stephanie, if I ever
said or did anything to mislead you I’m sorry for that, but right now I
have to do this groundhog thing and I don’t have a handle on it yet. He
throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll tell you what. I ’ m going to do some
serious thinking while I ’ m in Punxsutawney, okay? He pats her on the
shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her standing there with a
malevolent look on her face.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m on my way to Punxsutawney…
Punx^su-taw-ney….Work or fun? I think that all depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: . . . . I thought maybe you could meet me up
there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours….So I ’ m
supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>a sign</strong>: “Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original
Weather Capitol of the World Since 1887.” Depicted on the sign is a
large cartoon GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella
under his arm. The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the
outskirts of town.</p>
<p><strong>ext . motel - later</strong>: The van pulls into the parking
lot at a Quality Inn. The announcement billboard in ;front of the motel
reads: “Groundhog Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat -
$5.99.” The parking area is already crowded with cars including a number
of other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets
out. Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rita! I can’t stay here. Rita is already
helping Larry unload equipment from the van.</p>
<p>****: Prima donnas.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll handle it. She crosses to the
Lexus where Phil is trying to make another call on his earphone.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s the problem, Phil?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago
and I was miserable. It’s like a minimum security prison. I’m not
staying here.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re not staying here.</p>
<p>****: I ’ m not?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, Larry and I don’t care but I thought you
might, so I booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry
Street. Here’s the address. She hands him a card.</p>
<p>****: Great. That’s great. That’s the mark of a really good producer.
Making the talent happy.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Whatever I can do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Really? Will you be my love slave?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Whatever I can do within reason. Would you
like to have dinner with Larry and me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No thanks, I’ve seen Larry eat. Why don’t you
ditch Larry and let me take you someplace nice?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You mean like a date?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. I get it. You’re a little intimidated by
me, you’re all excited about the shoot tomorrow, you want everything to
go just perfect. I understand. You just get some sleep. Tomorrow will be
great.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, that’s something to look forward to.
I’ll see you in the morning. He drives off, leaving her standing there
shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did he actually call himself “the talent?”
Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear.</p>
<p><strong>close up - clock</strong>: A digital clock-radio changes from
5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and
Cher hit, “I Got You, Babe.”</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don’t
forget your booties because it’s COOOLD out there</p>
<p><strong>today1</strong>: Phil grimaces and swings out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>sidek ick</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday. W hat is
this– Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy
repartee as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous
travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing–</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: That “blizzard thing?” Phil splashes some
water on his face and prepares to shave.</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Oh, here’s the report: the National
Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Yes they are, but there’s another reason
today is very special–</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Es pec ia lly cold–</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Especially cold, okay, but the big question
on everybody’s lips–</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Ch ap pe d lips–</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: :–on their chapped lips, right– Do you think
Phil’s going to come out and see his shadow?</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Punxsutawney Phil. Phil looks up at
himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: That’s right, rodent lovers!</p>
<p><strong>both deejays</strong>: Groundhog Day1 SOUND EFFECT of
GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS. Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Never again.</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Morning .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Morning .</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Think it’ll be an early Spring?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ m predicting March 21st.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs. Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Would you like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t suppose it1 d be possible to get an
espresso or a capuccino around here.</p>
<p>****: I don’t really know –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Forget it. This ’11 be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: I wonder what the weather’s going to
be like for all the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: My guess is it’11 be cold and overcast, high
today in the low 30’s, dropping to the low 20’s tonight, but I’m
predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to
miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions
with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as
.Philadelphia.</p>
<p>****: You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy. He heads for
the door.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Unfortunately yes. Phil exits.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, Phil!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you!
Phil looks at him vaguely.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’m sorry. Have we– uh–</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: My oh my! Phil Connors. Don’t say you don’t
remember me, ’cause I sure as heckrfire remember you. Well? Phil stares,
trying to remember.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head. Come
on, buddy. Case Western High?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ned?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I see you clicking through that brain of yours.
Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click–Bing! Ned Ryerson, did the
whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show. Bing! Ned
Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior <sup>year</sup> almost didn’t
graduate. Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a
couple of times– ’til you told me not to anymore. Well?</p>
<p>****: Ned Ryerson.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Bing!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So what’re you doing with yourself, Ned?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Phil, I sell insurance.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Do you have life insurance, Phil? ’Cause if you
do, I bet you could u s e more– who couldn’t?–but I got a feeling you
don’t have any. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know, Ned, I ’ d love to talk to you but I
really have to– Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won’t take the
hint.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: That’s okay. I’ll walk with you. When I see an
opportunity, I charge it, like a bull. Ned the Bull, that’s me now. Some
of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it’s all
just a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single .premium life? That could
be the ticket for you, buddy. God, it’s good to see you! Hey, what’re
you doing for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Dinner? Umm, I don’t think that’s going to
work for me. As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs like a
donkey.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hey, look out for that first step! It’s a
doozy! Phil looks at him with murderous contempt.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How could he be late?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Prima donnas.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s just so– inconsiderate.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What happens to some people? They’re born
nice. They grow up nice. You put ’em on TV and - bam! Prima donnas. Rita
spots Phil heading into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil. Over here!
Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark near the
rail fence.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I got hung up with some jerk I went to high
school with. So, did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned,
didn’t you? Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re incredible.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Ready when you are. Phil takes the microphone
from Rita and positions himself against the fence. The Groundhog Club
Officials in top hats, striped trousers and cutaway coats parade out to
the burrow that houses Punxsutawney Phil.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Looks like they’re starting. Roll tape.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Rolling. Rita silently counts down from five
and cues Phil who instantly snaps into announce mode.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn here,
to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch a master at work. The
master? Punxsutawney Phil, the world’s most famous weatherman, the
groundhog, who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early
spring. Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive– so far, so good. A
Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and ceremoniously knocks on
the small wooden door, then opens it and retreats.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And here’s the big moment we’ve all been
waiting for. Let’s just see what Mr. Groundhog has to say. The groundhog
sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of the hole, and runs over
to the other side of the mound, about as far away from the cameras as he
can get.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey! Over here, you little weasel! Larry zooms
in as far as he can but the best he can manage is a close-up of the
groundhog’s back. The groundhog stands there a moment, his body casting
a long shadow, then he lets out a squeak and runs back into the
hole.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Great shot, huh, folks? Well, that was
certainly worth the trip. Now we’ll be hearing from Mr. Buster Greene,
President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the so-called Seer of
Seers who will interpret for us. BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top
hat and cutaway coat, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>b u st e r</strong>: He came out, and he saw his shadow.
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it’s going to be a long
winter. The crowd lets out a good-natured “Awwwwww” in
disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, that’s it. Sorry you couldn’t be here in
person to share the electric moment. This is one event where televison
really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered
to watch a large squirrel predict the weather, and I for one am deeply
grateful to have been a part of it. Reporting for Channel 9, this is
Phil Connors. Larry cuts the camera.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You want to try one that’s a little
sweeter?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s as sweet as I get. I’m outa here. As he
exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn’t expecting the throw and
bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.</p>
<p>****: Prima donnas.</p>
<p><strong>int . diner - later</strong>: Phil is sitting alone having a
cup of coffee in a busy, loud and lively cafe. Rita enters, sees him
sitting there, crosses to his table and sits down across from him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That was really lousy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is it my fault the little rat went south on
us?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: A real professional would have handled it. You
acted like it was a personal insult. Who do you think you are – Wolf
Blitzer?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: God, you really take this stuff seriously,
don’t you.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yes, I do. As far as I ’ m concerned there are
no little stories, Phil. Only little reporters with big egos who think
they’re too good for the job they have to do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You really don’t know me very well, do you.
’Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me. I
care! Call me a cockeyed optimist but I happen to think there’s more to
this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is that so.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, that is so. Rita is so irritated by him
she can’t even respond. Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So as far as us getting together, would you
say the glass is half empty or half full? Larry pokes his head in the
doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their
table.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You ready? We better get going if we ’ re
going to stay ahead of the weather.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t have to rush off, you know. That
storm is ’going to miss us completely.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Nice working with you, Phil. See you around.
Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll call you after I see the network guy. I
should be back there in a couple of hours…What?…1 can’t hear you– you’re
breaking up…Hello? Sabrina?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit! He slams the
phone back into it’s cradle, then looks up and notices slow traffic up
ahead. He honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop. He
keeps honking but nothing moves. He rolls down the window and looks up
ahead. The highway is a parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No. No!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s going on, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Nothin’s goin1 on. We’re closin1 the
road. Big accident up ahead. Blizzard movin1 in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What blizzard? A couple of flakes! An isolated
phenomenon of nature.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Are you nuts? We got a major storm movin’
in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, no. All that moisture is going to miss us
and hit Harrisburg.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Pal, you got that moisture on your
head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But I have to get to Pittsburgh today!</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Mister, the only place anybody’s goin’ on
this road is back to Punxsutawney. Phil glowers at him and shivers.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So all the long distance lines a re down? What
about the sa tellite? Is it snowing in space?…But I have to call
Pittsburgh…Isn’t there some special line you keep open for emergencies
or for celebrities?…Well, I’m both really. I’m a celebrity in an
emergency. Can you patch me through on that line?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You never saw me on TV– on the news?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t think so. What part of the news do
you do?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ m the White House correspondent for NBC
news.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh , I ’ m so sure .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ask me anything?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay, how big is the White House?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Three bedrooms, two and a half baths. Looks
much bigger than it , is. Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his
sense of humor. Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil
rushes into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS
flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she
won’t budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux, comes storming in
and tries to drag her back, until the BEST MAN restrains him and the
bridesmaids hustle the bride away. Phil watches the whole drama play
out, then turns back to Nancy .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Good start. I ’ m sure they’ll be very happy.
So what do you say? You want to play doggie obedience school with
me?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Thanks. I’ll pass. She gets up to leave.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sit! Stay! He watches her go, then tosses a
tip on the bar and exits somewhat unsteadily.</p>
<p><strong>insert - a thick book</strong>: The cover reads “101 Curses,
Spells and Enchantments You Can Do at Home.” A well-manicured feminine
hand opens the book to a marked page .</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Phil’s business card is dropped into a dish.
Then the Tarot card of the Hanged Man, a chicken bone, and a feather are
placed on top of it .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He stands at the sink, looking at himself in
the mirror, flexing his muscles .</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: Reading from the book&gt; she mutters
incantations in a secret language, then she sprinkles some powder on the
plate, then a few drops of oil. Then she makes a few passes over it with
her hands and, much to her surprise, the contents of the plate
spontaneously combust.</p>
<p><strong>stephanie</strong>: To complete the spell, she picks up a
broken wristwatch and drops it into the fire.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Phil’s business card, the Hanged Man and the
broken watch in flames. The watch crystal is cracked and the hands are
frozen at 5:59.</p>
<p><strong>c lose up - clock</strong>: The digital clock-radio changes
from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny
and Cher hit, “I Got You, Babe,” just as it did the day before.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don’t
forget your booties because it’s COOOLD out there today!</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday. What is
this– Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil “mock” laughs at exactly the
same time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nice going guys. That’s yesterday’s tape. Phil
crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only half-listening
to the radio.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Not hardly. Expect hazardous travel later
today with that, you know, blizzard thing –</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: That “blizzard thing?” Phil turns on the
water and splashes some on his face as if trying to wake himself up,
vaguely disturbed by the repetition of the broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Oh, here’s the report: the National
Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.”</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Yes they are, but there’s another reason
today is very special –</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Especially cold –</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Especially cold, okay, but the big question
on everybody’s lips – Phil supplies the next line in unison with the
radio.</p>
<p><strong>sidekick and phil</strong>: Chapped lips –</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: – on their chapped lips, right – Do you
think Phil’s going to come out and see his shadow?</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: Punxsutawney Phil. Some vague doubt causes
Phil to go to the window.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: That’s right, rodent lovers!</p>
<p><strong>both deejays</strong>: Groundhog Day! SOUND EFFECT of
GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS as Phil pulls back the curtains and looks out.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The street is full of people heading toward
Gobbler’s Knob, exactly as they did the day before.</p>
<p>****: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Think it’ll be an early Spring?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Didn’t we do this yesterday?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what you mean. Phil grabs him by the front of his
shirt and looks deep into his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t mess with me, pork chop. What day is
this?</p>
<p>****: Febr uary second–Groundhog Day! Phil can see he’s telling the
truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. Sorry. I’m having a bad day. Phil walks
on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: D i d I? I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Would you like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, thank you. I ’ m feeling a little
strange.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: I wonder what the weather’s going to
be like for all the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs. Lancaster?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Is that the Italian dessert with the
brandy and the chocolate mousse?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, that’s spaghetti. Never mind. He heads for
the door, still in a daze.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Oh, will you be checking out today,
Mr. Connors?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. I don’t think so. I’ll tell you after I wake up.
Phil exits.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ma’am? Excuse me. Where’s everybody going?</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: To Gobbler’s Knob. It’s Groundhog Day! The
coffee cup drops from Phil’s hand as he stands there open- mouthed. Then
he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if trying to clear it and
starts off down the street.</p>
<p><strong>ned ryerson</strong>: Hey, Phil! Ned Ryerson approaches with
the same obnoxious attitude.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you!
Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: My oh my! Phil Connors. Don’t say you don’t
remember me, ’cause I sure as heck-fire remember you. Well?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ned Ryerson?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Bing! First shot right out of the box. So how’s
it going, ol’ buddy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ’ m not
feeling real well. Could you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Now it’s funny you should mention your health
’cause you’ll never guess what I do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: desperate to get away Do you sell insurance,
Ned?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Bing again! You’re sharp as a tack today. Do
you have life insurance, Phil? ’Cause if you do, I bet you could use
more – who couldn’t?” – but I got a feeling you don’t have any. Am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did I say “fuck off,” Ned? I can’t talk to you
right now. He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep,
slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.</p>
<p>****: Hey, look .out for that first v step. It’s a doozyi Phil looks
down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward Gobbler’s
Knob.</p>
<p><strong>ext . gobbler ’ s knob - dawn</strong>: The crowd is gathered
as before for the big moment. In the press area, Rita is having the same
dialogue with Larry, when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil! Over here!
Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the Knob,
gesturing for her to follow. Larry shakes his head as Rita charges
through the crowd toward Phil. She catches up to him just as he is
scratching a mark in the snow with his foot. She notices immediately
that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
mussed.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where ’ ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ve got to talk to you. I think I’m losing my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>. rita</strong>: I know you’re losing it. What are you doing
over here? The camera’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Slap me, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p>****: Just slap me– hard. She gives up and taps him lightly on the
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I said hardl</p>
<p><strong>. . .. … .rita .</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do it! Rita shrugs and slaps him very
hard.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Better. Almost too hard, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, drunk is more fun. Can I be serious with
you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes. I ’ m being serious. I’ m having a
problem– no, I may be having a problem.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m trying to say that if I was having a
problem, just hypothetical ly, I ’ d like to know that you’re someone I
could count on in a crisis.</p>
<p>****: What did you do last night? The crowd begins to hush.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We better get started. We’re going to miss
it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Were not going to miss it.</p>
<p>****: They’re going to miss it.</p>
<p>****: Phil. We’ve been out here for an hour. We’re cold and tired.
Let’s just get this and get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, put it here.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Put the camera here . Rita takes a forlorn
glance towards the press area, where all of the other cameras are set up
.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phil , there is no tomorrow on this one. It’s
Groundhog Day.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We were in the wrong spot yesterday .</p>
<p>****: W ha t? Yesterday? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just trust me. Put the camera here .</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Larry! She charges off toward the cameras. In
the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to their cameras,
dribbling on about how “He could appear any second now.” Rita and Larry
grab their gear and rush back to Phil. Larry hurriedly sets up the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You want me to roll tape?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Are you going to get on your mark?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No hurry. Larry glances over at the other news
reporters, all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the
mound.</p>
<p>****: Everyone else is rolling! Rita looks helplessly at Phil.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m begging you, all right? Gould we please
just do this? Phil glances down at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, let’s do it. He crosses over to Larry
and taps him on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Roll tape.</p>
<p>****: Prima donnas. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions
himself against the fence.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We ll, it’s Groundhog Day– again– and you know
what that means. Everybody’s here on Gobbler’s Knob waiting in the cold
for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world,
Punxsutawney Phil, who’s going to tell us just how much more of this we
can expect. The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog’s door,
then opens it and retreats. Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first
experimental prediction, recalling the previous day.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: My forecast is we’re going to see the
groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then
he’s going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the
crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s it. I’m going to kill him. Phil looks
at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: O k ay ? And here we go– Phil points to the
hole and Larry zooms in. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left,
looks right, steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
directly over to Larry’s camera. As he stands there, his body casts a
long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the camera, lets out a
squeak, and runs back into the hole. Rita and Larry are completely
amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry
pans back to Phil. Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the
groundhog burrow.</p>
<p>****: Phil! Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto
the mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry,
ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it’s going to be a long winter.
Again the crowd lets out a good-natured “Awwwwww” in disappointment.
Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog,
without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in
Punxsutawney. She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing
her finger across her throat.</p>
<p><strong>int; phil’s room</strong>: Phil is on the phone desperately
trying to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know there’s a blizzard, but I have to get a
call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh. It’s a medical emergency. . .
.No, don’t give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department. When do you think
the long distance lines will be working again?. . . But what if we don’t
have a tomorrow? We didn’t have one today, my friend… Hello…Hello? He
hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then
he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his
head. A moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand,
breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand. Then he
lies back down and retreats back under the covers.</p>
<p><strong>close up - clock</strong>: The digital clock-radio changes
from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny
and Cher hit, “I Got You, Babe,” just as it did the day before.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don’t
forget your booties because it’s COOOLD out there today!</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday. What is
this– Miami Beach? Phil rushes out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Painting something, Mr. Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ m conducting an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>phil and deejay</strong>: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and
don’t forget your booties because it’s COOOLD out there today.</p>
<p><strong>phil and sidekick</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday.
What is this – Miami Beach? The deejay laughs. Phil laughs insanely
along with him.</p>
<p><strong>ext . gobbler ’ s knob - early morning</strong>: Phil is
wrapping up another groundhog report, trying to be completely
professional despite the circumstances.</p>
<p>****: . . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog I guess we can expect six
more weeks of winter. It’s not very scientific, but it sure is fun. Hey,
wait a second. If he’s right, I could be out of a job! For Channel 9
News, this is Phil Connors in Punxsutawney . He holds until Larry stops
tape, then approaches Rita.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p>****: It was good. A little smarmy for my taste, but I guess that’s
what sells.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Could I talk to you about a matter that is not
work related?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You never talk about work.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you know what I did last night?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Do I want to know?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I destroyed my hotel room.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You whatl This is not some kind of rock and
roll tour. We don’t have the budget for that–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, it’s okay. This morning it was all right
again. That’s what I have to talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phil, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Could I have some coffee, please? The waiter
pours her a cup.</p>
<p>****: I’ll be back to take your order.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thanks. Okay, so tell me. How’d you know where
to put the camera?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Because I’ve done it before.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I know, but the groundhog doesn’t do exactly
the same thing every year, does he?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ m not talking about last year. I ’ m
talking about today. I lived it before.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re having deja vu?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Big time. Rita, I know it’s nuts but I keep
reliving the same day o ve r and over– Groundhog Day– today. This is the
third time.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Uh-huh. I’m waiting for the punchline.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, really. It’s like today never happened. I
shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably
cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They’d grow back. Just like a
starfish. I probably don’t even have to floss?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m wracking my brain, but I can’t even begin
to imagine why you’d make up something like this.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ’Cause I’m not making it up. I’m asking for
your help. Rita looks at him for a long moment.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay, I’ll bite. What do you want me to
do?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The truth? I’d 1ike you to spend the next 24
hours with me and don’t leave my side for a second.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I see. You know, Phil, you can charm all the
little P.A.’s at the station, all the secretaries, and even some of the
weekend a nchors, but not me– not in a thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wa it a second–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Not if I was dying and your breath was the
only cure; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the
human race. Just get it out of your head because it is NOT GOING TO</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So much for the truth. Larry pokes his head in
the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their
table.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You ready? We better get going if we’re going
to stay ahead of the weather.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah, , I ’ m . ready, Larry.</p>
<p>****: Good luck, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: X-rays of Phil’s skull are slapped up onto a
light box.</p>
<p><strong>neurologist</strong>: No spots, no tumors, no lesions, no
clots, no aneurisms. Everything looks fine and dandy to me, Mr. Connors.
Have you considered psychiatric help?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: That’s kind of an unusual problem,
Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples and families. Phil is lying
on a couch. His head is completely shaved.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but you’re still a psychologist. You
must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Sort of, I guess. Abnormal
Psychology.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So based on that what would you say?</p>
<p>****: I ’ d say that maybe you’re – I don’t know – a little
delusional.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re saying this thing is not really
happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Then how do I know this conversation is really
happening?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: I guess you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Then forget about me paying you. A discreet
little alarm sounds.</p>
<p>****: I’m afraid that’s all the time we have, Mr. Connors.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait! Are you saying I’m crazy?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Not necessarily. If it concerns you we
should schedule our next session as soon as possible. How’s tomorrow for
you? Phil glowers at him.</p>
<p><strong>insert - a model of the solar system</strong>: A SCIENTIST in
a white lab coat is holding up the model. Phil looks on with
interest.</p>
<p>****: Now if the moon exerts a gravitational pull strong enough to
cause the tides, .then it may be theoretically possible for a Black Hole
or a Singularity of sufficient magnitude to actually bend time enough to
cause it to fold back ,on itself.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You think that’s a realistic possibility? A
paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy outburst of
juvenile laughter. We pull back to REVEAL:</p>
<p>****: All right! I think someone may just need a little visit to the
Assistant Principal’s office! Get back in your seats. The bell has not
rung yet. The kids sit back down, but keep up their noisy chatter.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Well, I ’ m speaking purely
hypothetically.</p>
<p><strong>teach er</strong>: So the princess picked up the frog and
kissed him. Phil stops outside the door to listen.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Now who can tell me what happened when the
princess kissed the frog.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Her lips got slimed! The whole class
erupts in giggles and shrieks.</p>
<p><strong>t eacher</strong>: Okay, come on now. What happened when she
kissed the frog?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: The princess kissed the frog and the
spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got
married and lived happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gus, what would you do if there was no
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You mean like if the world was gonna end?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I mean like if it was never going to end.
If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldn’t get
out and nothing you did mattered?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You’re right. Everyday is the same, I can’t get
out of here and nothin’ I do matters.</p>
<p><strong>v ralph</strong>: No, he’s askin1 you a question, ya
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What was the question?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What if nothing mattered?! Jeez, I know what
I’d do. I ’ d j ust spend all my time drivin’ fast, gettin1 loaded and
gettin’ laid. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s it. It just doesn’t get any better than
this, does it? Good friends, good conversation and quality brew. Drink
up, boys. They salute each other and drink.</p>
<p>****: Where you stayin’, Phil? We’ll drop you off.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, friends don’t let friends drive drunk.
Give me your keys.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Thanks , man .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s nothing. Get in. They all pile into the
front seat with Phil at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Seatbelts. Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs
up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts.
Suddenly, Phil floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a
parked car as he screeches around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is great, Ralph!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Oh, hey, take a left! Phil passes the
intersection.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You missed it!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No problem –</p>
<p><strong>ext . main street - continuous</strong>: Phil throws the car
into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up on the curb, across a couple
of lawns, takes out a mailbox and a STOP sign and bounces back onto the
street. A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and
takes off after him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So many rules –</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: “Don’t do this–”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: “Don’t do that –” He mows down a row of
parking meters.</p>
<p><strong>police car</strong>: It comes screaming around a corner in
hot pursuit of the Buick</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No more rules!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: No more rules!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: That’s two!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I’m having a great time! Phil speeds up to a
hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking even worse from the liquor and
the motion of the car.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, uh –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Phil.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah, Phil– like the groundhog.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hey, Phil? How’re we going to get out of
this?</p>
<p><strong>their pov - the intersection ahead</strong>: Two police cars
with lights flashing are parked sideways, completely blocking the road.
Officers stand in the roadway, motioning for Phil to stop.</p>
<p>****: Gus, you’re just going to have to trust me on this one. He
tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus’s eyes go wide with terror. The
police dive out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>phil and ralph</strong>: Yahooooo!</p>
<p><strong>their pov - through the windshield</strong>: The Buick
crashes head on into one of the police cars.</p>
<p><strong>c lose up - clock</strong>: The time changes from 5:59 to
6:00. The radio starts playing “I Got You, Babe.” Phil sits up suddenly
and looks around, completely amazed. He is in his room at the bed and
breakfast, everything exactly the same as before. He hops out of bed and
quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The
music ends and the two deej ays come on.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don’t
forget your booties because it’s COOOLD out there today. Phil talks out
loud along with them.</p>
<p><strong>phil and sidekick</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday.
What is this– Miami Beach?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: W o u l d you– Phil interrupts,
answering all her questions before she even asks them.</p>
<p>****: Yes, I would like some coffee; the weather is going to be cold
and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today; and yes, I
will be staying an extra day.</p>
<p>****: Why thank you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been around here
looking for me this morning? Maybe a state official, blue coat, hat,
gun, nightstick, badge, driving a late-model Ford br Chevy, black and
white with bub ble lights on top–</p>
<p>****: No, no one like that– I .don’t– Will they be?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Apparently not. Phil gooses her, grabs a sweet
roll, and heads for the door, starting to believe now that he can truly
do anything he wants to.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hey, Phil! Phil slips off his glove as Ned
Ryerson lumbers toward him.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Phil! Phil Connors!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head! Before Ned can
say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes down, Phil puts his glove
back on and keeps walking. Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he
stepped in before. A PEDESTRIAN walking behind him steps right into
it.</p>
<p><strong>ext . gobbler’s knob - later</strong>: Phil is passing
through the crowd on his way to the press area when he notices NANCY,
the girl he met at the hotel bar, and stops to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You here to see the groundhog? She gives him a
look. It’s obvious she’s never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Can you think of another reason anybody’d be
out here at dawn on a freezing day?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nancy Taylor. And you are–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where’d you go to high school?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p>****: High school? She really doesn’t know what to make of Phil but
she decides to play along.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Lincoln High school. In Pittsburgh. Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who was your twelfth grade English
teacher?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: .Mrs. Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Walsh. Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Is this some kind of come-on?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m not really sure. We’ll have to see. Phil
walks off and joins Rita at their camera position.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is this some new fad diet? Don’t you worry
about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a
chocolate eclair.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t worry about anything anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What makes you so special? Everybody worries
about something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s exactly what makes me so special. He
takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: “The wretch, concentered all in self, Living,
shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile
dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.” Sir Walter
Scott.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: “There was a young man from Na n t uc k e
t–”</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s really funny. When are you going to
grow up, Phil?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: At this rate– never.</p>
<p>****: Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You really do have a death wish, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish.
I’m just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don’t
you ever just want to cut loose and go wild?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I wouldn’t even know what it means to go
wild.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s where I come in. Going wild
is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove
head- on into a police car.</p>
<p>****: Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s my point. I know you won’t believe me,
but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn’t matter one bit.
Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And how. . , do we manage that?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You leave that to me. Why don’t you send Larry
back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it
through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll take my chances with the -weather. But
you have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t worry. I plan to.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nancy? Nancy turns and looks at him
quizzically.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nancy, right?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m sorry, I–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I sat next to you
in Mrs. Walsh’s English class.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: T h at –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Phil Connors.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: –is amazing!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t remember me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t– sure, I think–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We used to shoot spit balls–</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, oh, God–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I even asked you to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Phil Connors.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How ARE you?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ m great. Wow, you look terrific. Hey,
listen, I gotta d o this report–</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You’re a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Weatherman. Channel 9, Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right, I should’ve known–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But maybe after we could –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I ’ d like that –</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phil! Rita is calling from across the crowd.
She looks at him with disapproval .</p>
<p>****: Oh, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh , Rita . The woman suddenly freezes. There
is a moment of silence, then she snaps on the light. It’s Nancy, not
Rita. Phil is as surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>****: Who’s Rita?</p>
<p>****: No one. It’s just something I say when I make love. You know –
“Orita”, “Orighta”– it’s like “Oh, baby” or something.</p>
<p>****: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: O-rita. Nancy laughs uncertainly. Phil
switches off the light, thinking now about Rita.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing
only pajamas, absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the
books. Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Isn’t it a wonderful collection?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, it is. You don’t usually find this many
trashy novels in one place.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: You can take a book up to your room
if you like.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, thank you. I’ve actually read them all. I
was just rereading some of the dirty parts. He finishes and puts the
book back on the shelf.</p>
<p>****: How long will you be staying with us, Mr. Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Indefinitely. I’ve already been here for 211
days.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Really? That’s quite a long time,
isn’t it. I hope you’re finding things to do in our little town.</p>
<p>****: Yes, well, I’m getting a little tired of casual sex so today I
thought I’d rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car.</p>
<p>****: All right, freeze!! Drop your guns J! The guards stand there
frozen with terror.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You guys ever been held up before?</p>
<p>****: It’s kind of exciting, isn’t it?</p>
<p>****: I guess so. Something to tell the kids about.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. By the way, I’m Phil. He raises the mask
and shows his face.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Herman.</p>
<p><strong>s e c o n d guard</strong>: Felix.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it easy, boys.
And thanks. The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large
satchels of cash.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: A real beauty, huh. We picked it u p at
a–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll take it. How much?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Well, the sticker says $62,999 bu t if you
want–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you $70,000 if
you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here
with my car. The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts
counting out stacks of bills.</p>
<p><strong>laraine</strong>: I thought we were going to a costume
party.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, we are, we are. But first I have this
movie theater fantasy I want to talk to you about. He escorts her into
the theater.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but eventually you’ d just get tired of
screwing around and then you’d want a real relationship, wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I don’t know. A big German Shepherd tries to
jump up on the bed with them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Get down, Brunoi</p>
<p>****: Someone decent, someone who you respected, who respects
you.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I guess so. The dog jumps up again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Down , Bruno ! It’s tough to find a
relationship like that, especially if your time is kind of limited. But
you still have to try, don’t you? Bruno! I told you! Off the bed! Phil
looks over at Angle who’s passed out with her mouth open</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There ’ s got to be more to it than this.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You look good. I mean, it came o ut all right.
How’d you know where to put the camera?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Psychic. So did you have a nice evening?</p>
<p>****: I just had a sandwich, watched some TV and went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I got my whole body tattooed and part ied all
night with some nymphomaniac biker chicks.</p>
<p>****: Sounds wholesome. Were those the new 24-hour disappearing
tattoos or can I see them?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, they’re gone. Rita, if you only had one
day to live, what would you do with it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know, Phil. What are you dying of?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I mean like what if the entire world was
about to explode?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I ’ d just want to know where to p ut the
camera. What are you looking for, Phil– a date for the weekend? She
starts walking toward the center of town. Phil sticks right with
her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I just want to know you better. What do
you like, what do you want, what do you think about, what kind of men
are you interested in, what do you do for fun?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is this real or are you just going to make me
feel like a fool?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m just trying to talk to you like a normal
person. Isn’t this how normal people talk?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Close.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, so talk to me. C’mon, I’ll buy you a cup
of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I guess I want what everybody wants– you know,
career, love, marriage, children. So far I don’t have any of it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You have a career.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I have a job. Doing stories on the
Punxsutawney groundhog is not my ultimate goal. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How about the other stuff? You seeing
anybody?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is getting too personal. I don’t think I
’ m ready to discuss these things with you. What about you? What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What I really want is someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: O h , please–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phil, you know, you have so much talent and
ability. If you’d just drop the attitude and act like a decent human
being, then maybe I ’ d –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’d what?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Then maybe you’d like me? She stares hard at
him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know. It’s sort of like the way I feel
about UFO’s. I’d have to see it to believe it. Larry pokes his head in
the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their
table.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You ready? We better get going if we’re going
to stay ahead of the weather.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah, I’ll be right out, Larry. Larry scowls
at Phil and exits.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why don’t you stay for a while? The road’s
going to be closed anyway. Do you really want to be stuck in the van
with Larry for three hours?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ve got to get back. I’ll see you later. Phil
watches Rita exit.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s pov</strong>: Rita gets in the news van and drives off
with Larry. Phil stares out the window, more” determined than ever to
win her over.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, you heard it right from the groundhog’s
mouth. Bundle up good, ’cause it’s going to be a long winter– at least
in Punxsutawney. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry
stops tape.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That was great. How did you know</p>
<p>****: I have to go now. There’s something I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, hi, Rita. You still here?</p>
<p>****: The van won’t start. Larry’s working on it.</p>
<p>****: Wouldn’t you know it. Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jack Daniels.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: For you, miss?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Tequila,with lime. Gold, if you’ve got it.
Phil nods to himself.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - another day</strong>: Phil walks in and sits
next to Rita.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, hi, Rita. You still here?</p>
<p>****: The van won’t start. Larry’s working on it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wouldn’t you know it. Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tequila with lime, gold if you’ve got it. Rita
looks at Phil, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: For you miss?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Same for me, please. The BARTENDER pours.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What should we toast to?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Your call.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: To the groundhog! Rita stares for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I always drink to world peace.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Take your order?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tequila with lime, gold if you’ve got it. Rita
looks at Phil.</p>
<p><strong>, bartender</strong>: For you, miss?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Same for me, please. The BARTENDER pours. Phil
lifts his glass.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: To world peace. Rita smiles, reevaluating
him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: To world peace. They clink glasses.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You like your job?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s okay. I think it could be really
challenging. Of course it’s about a million miles from where I started
out in college.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You weren’t in broadcasting?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh. “Believe it or not, I
studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Really? What a waste of time. Rita looks
offended. Phil knows he made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You weren’t in broadcasting?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh. Believe it or not, I
studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry. Phil leans in closer to
her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: La fille qui j’aimera Sera comme bon vin Qui
se bonifiera Un peut chaque matin. Rita smiles, entranced.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is terrific.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Best fudge in town.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How do you know so much about
Punxsutawney?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I like small towns. I think they engender real
community more than big cities.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That is so true! I’ve always thought that,
too.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No kidding. Here– try the white chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, yuk, don’t make me sick.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No white chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: There’s something so familiar about this. Do
you ever have deja vu? Phil smiles. Then Larry enters.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t believe it. Someone bought every
distributor cap in this town. We’re going to be stuck here all night1
Over Phil’s sympathetic look we hear the song, “I Can’t Get Started With
You”.</p>
<p><strong>ext . cherry street inn - night</strong>: Phil and Rita are
walking slowly, very close.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I ’ m just amazed. And I’m not easily
amazed.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How you can start a day with one kind of
expectation and end up so completely different.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you like how this day is turning out?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yes. I like it very much. They stop dn front
of Phil’s hotel. She turns to him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You could never have planned a day like this,
but it couldn’t have been more perfect.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re wrong. I’ve been planning this day for
weeks. Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her but
she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him.  They enter the
bed and breakfast inn.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thanks. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tomorrow? Wait, aren’t you going to come up to
my room for a while?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know, Phil–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No�reason to end a perfect day.</p>
<p>****: Well– we better not.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, you should. The, uh, the poetry! I’ve got
some books, Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could l ig ht a fire–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thanks, but –</p>
<p>****: Please come, Rita. It’ll be –</p>
<p>****: Phil, I’m tired. We can be together tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But there is no tomorrow for me!</p>
<p>****: Let’s not ruin it, Phil. There’s no way I ’ m sleeping with you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why not? Rita, I love you!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You don’t even know me!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Please! You have to! Rita shakes loose from
his grasp.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s wrong with you! There is a long moment
of silent tension, then all her old doubts about Phil come rushing
back.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, no. I can’t believe I fell for it. This
whole day was just one long set-up. And I ate fudge. Yucchh! I hate
fudge.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, it was real. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Stop saying that! Do you really expect me to
trust you? The whole secretarial pool is a Phil Connors recovery
group.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But I can change! I really can– Rita slaps him
hard on the cheek.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s for making me care about you. She turns
and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting.</p>
<p>****: Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties
because it’s cooooold out there today. Phil continues the radio report
at his own pace, obviously fatigued.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s cold out there everyday. What is this –
Miami Beach? Haw. Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous travel later
today with that, you know, blizzard thing.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hi, Nancy.</p>
<p>****: Hi. Do I know you? Phil can’t manage enough enthusiasm to
pursue her yet again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I guess not. I thought you were someone
else. Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the
camera. Rita comes over to him.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Are you all right, Phil? You look terrible.
Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away.</p>
<p>****: I ’ m fine.</p>
<p><strong>int . biker bar - night</strong>: The balls CRACK as the cue
ball breaks the rack. Phil is walking around the table, cue in hand,
sinking ball after ball, while several admiring HUSTLERS look on.</p>
<p><strong>first hustler</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>second hustler</strong>: I don’t know. Hey, mister–</p>
<p>****: Who are you, anyway? Phil shoots, sinks a tough one.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t know me? I’ve been playing here
every day for two months.</p>
<p><strong>first hustler</strong>: Oh, yeah? So how come I ain’t seen
you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. I seen you.</p>
<p><strong>second hustler</strong>: So what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They call me– Punxsutawney Phil.</p>
<p><strong>second hustler</strong>: Punxsutawney Phil? Like the
groundhog.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, like the groundhog. Phil sinks another
one.</p>
<p>****: This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to
civilization. With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest
control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into
the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they
hated the winter so damned much, why don’t they move to Florida,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>close up - tv set</strong>: The program JEOPARDY! is
playing.</p>
<p><strong>alex trebeck</strong>: Nobel prize-winning co- discoverers of
the DNA molecule.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who are Watson and Crick.</p>
<p><strong>contestant</strong>: Who are Watson and Crick?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Correct. There is a cheering from a small
group of people off-screen.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Twin brother and sister Sebastian and Olivia
create confusion in this Shakespearean comedy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What is “Twelfth Night.”</p>
<p><strong>contestant</strong>: What is “Twelfth Night?”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Correct. More cheering from the small
group.</p>
<p><strong>contestant</strong>: I’ll take New Jersey for eight hundred,
Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And the answer is– an audio daily double.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Count Basie.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Two thousand six hundred and s e ve n ty -o n
e– two thousand six hundred and se v en t y -t w o – two thousand six
hundred and seventy-thr-ee-^- A woman passes walking her dog.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, pick up after your dog!</p>
<p><strong>dog walker</strong>: He hasn’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He’s going to!</p>
<p>****: There and there. And there! Phil continues walking, counting
the sidewalk cracks. THREE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS notice Phil and walk along,
matching him step for step.</p>
<p><strong>iphil</strong>: Two thousand six hundred and seventy-four,
two thousand six hundred and seventy-five, two</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Five million eight hundred–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: S i x hundred–</p>
<p><strong>mike and sue</strong>: Ninety, twenty, four, six, fifty–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Two thousand, four hundred–</p>
<p><strong>joey, mike and sue</strong>: Two, eight, nine, forty-six–
Phil stops. He has lost count. His lip curls up like an animal as he
turns slowly, growling at the kids. They run away screaming with glee.
Phil starts after them but runs right into a COP.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You got a problem, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, I got a problem, buddy! I can’t stand
this place anymore! I can’t stand this street and I can’t stand the
fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad
weather and the “quaint” little shops and most of all, I can’t stand
anything– ANYTHING– with a groundhog on it. He rips a groundhog patch
off the cop’s jacket sleeve.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Then let’s see what we can do about getting you out of
here. You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Phil.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Phil. Like the groundhog! Phil turns to the cop
like a rabid dog, ready to strike.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, like the– –groundhog. Some big new idea
has formed in his mind.</p>
<p><strong>ext . gobbler’s knob - early morning</strong>: Rita is
looking at Phil as Larry videotapes his report.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The guy’s nuts. He’s out of his gourd.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Let him finish, then I’ll call the station.
They turn back to watch Phil’s wrap-up. Phil is completely unkempt,
still wearing only pajama bottoms and his overcoat, looking even more
demented.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There is no way this winter is ever going to
end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow everyday. I don’t
see any other way out. He’s got to be stopped and I’ve got to stop him.
For Channel 9 news, this is Phil Connors.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He ain’t there. Phil doesn’t move. He-doesn’t
care that she sees him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You can wait all night, but he ain’t coming
out. He don’t live there. They keep him in the library. Phil’s gun
droops. The woman begins to walk off, then stops.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Plug him once for me.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s pov</strong>: The groundhog looks right into his
sights. Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT. The glass window is
still intact, not a scratch on it. The groundhog looks up playfully.
Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil can’t
believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the rifle butt. He
can’t even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from behind by TWO STRONG MEN
who take the rifle from him and wrestle him to floor. The librarian
comes running up and looks at the groundhog.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: He’s just fine. That’s two inches of
bullet-proof glass there. You can’t be too careful in this day and
age.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where were you this morning? How could you
possibly miss the shoot?</p>
<p>****: I’ve come to the end of me, Rita. There’s only one way out now.
Just remember/we had a wonderful day together once. Phil kisses her
gently on the cheek and walks off toward the back of the knob. Rita
watches him, then follows at a discreet distance, very worried. In a
small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow, Buster Greene and
TWO other GROUNDHOG CLUB OFFICIALS are lifting a cage into the front
seat of Buster’s pickup.</p>
<p><strong>b uster</strong>: There you go, ol’ buddy. Good job. Hey! He
smiled at me. See that?</p>
<p><strong>first official</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: There, little fella. The other official
looks up and sees Phil walking toward them like a zombie.</p>
<p><strong>other official</strong>: Hi, there, mister. Something I can
do you for? Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the
pickup and starts it up .</p>
<p><strong>first official</strong>: Hey! What ’re you – ! Phil drives
off in Buster’s truck. Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs
back toward the knob.</p>
<p>****: Larry! Buster and his aides race for another car parked
nearby.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Jake! Call the police, and get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil. We’re going after him. Come on, Tommy! They
jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off after the pickup.
Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Let’s go! Phil just snatched the groundhog!
Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the gear.</p>
<p>****: Probably some kind of gerbil deal. Pervert.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Coming to the end of the trail, Phil. Then
we’re going out in a blaze of glory.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with
it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What is he doing? What can he be thinking? He
must1 ve just – snapped. Larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the
camera mounted on his shoulder .</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This oughta be good.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Okay! I know this road. There’s no way off ’
cept the way we come up.</p>
<p><strong>first official</strong>: All right! We got him now.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, pal. It’s showtime. Phil hits the
gas.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He slowly opens his eyes and blinks. He looks
around and realizes he’s back in his room at the bed and breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ah, nuts! Phil throws off the covers and hurls
himself out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>d rivers’ pov</strong>: He sees Phil through the windshield
but doesn’t even have time to hit the brakes before he runs right over
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>a tv screen</strong>: A woman in some horror movie is
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Mrs. Lancaster is watching TV in the parlor
of the hotel. In the corridor behind her, Phil walks by, dressed in a
robe, carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the
bathroom. A few moments pass. We hear the zap of an electrocution, the
lights and TV flicker and dim for a moment, then come back on again.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I ’ m sorry. What was that again?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m a god.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re God?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I’m A god. Not THE God– at least I don’t
think I am.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s reassuring. For a mintute there I
thought you might be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, it’s true. It’s the only possible
explanation. I’m a supernatural being.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Because you survived a car wreck?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are you ready to order?</p>
<p>****: Not just the car wreck! I didn’t just blow up yesterday, you
know. I’ve been run over, drowned, crushed, stabbed, shot, electrocuted,
poisoned, frozen, burn ed, and asphyxiated–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Really? The waiter looks at him like he’s
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: –but I always wake up the next day without a
scratch, without even a headache. I’m telling you, I ’ m immortal.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: The special today is blueberry waffles.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p>****: Because some people like blueberry waffles.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No t you– him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Because I want you to believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re not a god, Phil. Take my word for it.
This is twelve years of Catholic school talking.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I could come back if you’re not ready.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How do you know I’m not a god?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Because it’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I’ll come back. The /waiter turns to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, Billy! The waiter turns back.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is Bill. He’s been a waiter for three
years because he left Penn State and had to find work. He likes the
town, he paints toy soldiers, and he’s gay.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I am notl Phil grabs an astonished Rita and
pulls her over to the next table.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is Doris Kleiser and her fiance Fred.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They’re supposed to get married tonight but
Doris is having second thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What! Doris touces her engagement ring,
dumbfounded. Rita is a little embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Lovely ring.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is Ralph. Say “Hi,” Rita. Rita flashes a
quick smile.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Don’t believe I’ve had the–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive
around town smashing into policemen.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Well, who don’t?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is some kind of trick.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, it’s a trick. But maybe the real God
cheats, too. Maybe God isn’t omnipotent– he’s just had a lot of
practice.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How about that guy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tom. Worked in the coal mine �til they shut it
down.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Her?</p>
<p><strong>phil ’</strong>: Nancy. Went to Lincoln High School in
Pittsburgh. Takes herself out to lunch once a week. Rita is getting very
bewildered. From their reactions she can see that Phil is right about
each and every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How do you know these people!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I told you the truth. In five seconds there’s
going to be a grease fire in the kitchen. Five, four–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is nuts.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: –three, two, one. Phil points to the kitchen
as smoke starts pouring from the service window. Everyone in the diner
is now staring at them</p>
<p>****: Okay, enough. Let’s just sit down and think for a second. What
do you know about me, Phil? Do you know me, too? Phil takes a long
pause.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know all about you, Rita. I know you like
producing, but hope for better than Channel 9, Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Everyone knows that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You like boats but not the ocean. There’s a
lake you go to in the summer with your family, up in the mountains, with
an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof, and
a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone, and at night you’d
look up and see the stars. You’re a sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon
Brando, and French poetry. You’re wonderfully generous; you’re kind to
strangers, and children; and when you stand in the snow, you look like
an angel.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I told you! I wake up every day right here,
right in Punxsutawney, and it’s always February second and I can’t turn
it off. If you still don’t bel iev e me, listen–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: B u t , Phil–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen! In ten seconds Larry is going to walk
through that door and take you away from me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Larry?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But you can’t let him. Please believe me.
You’ve got to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t – Larry pokes his head in the doorway,
looks around and spots Rita.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look. As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil
grabs a pen and pad from a passing waitress and quickly writes something
down as Larry makes his way to their table. Phil finishes writing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You ready? We better get going if we’re going
to stay ahead of the weather. Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads
it.</p>
<p>****: ” . . . stay ahead of the weather. ” Larry looks at the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What ’ s that? Rita looks at Phil with new
understanding and empathy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Afer I got over the shock, it was kind of fun
for the first year or two. I had anything I wanted. Except you, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: How did this start?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. I just woke up. Just like
always. NED RY-ERSON approaches.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hey, Phil! Phil Connors 1</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rita, this is Ned Ryerson. He’s an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He remembers me! Phil and Rita keep walking.
Rita looks back at Ned, perplexed</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Trust me on that one.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is great.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, it isn’t. You hate fudge.</p>
<p><strong>. rita</strong>: Just how well do we know each other?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I told you. I know everybody. Rita stops
walking.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Did we ever…you know?</p>
<p>****: Did we ever! You were an animal.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re European trained, aren’t you. Phil
continues walking.</p>
<p>****: Phil! It’s not funny. She catches up to him. Phil turns to
her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You weren’t interested.</p>
<p>****: Okay. She begins walking again.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Not that it would’ve been so awful.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I just had to know whether to smack you or
not.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So do you believe any of this?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know how else you could
know so much. Maybe it is really happening.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I used to try to stay up all night sometimes.
I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going
on, or at least hang onto something from the day before. But I gave up
on that a long time ago. Rita looks at him with compassion.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It sounds so– lonely.</p>
<p>****: It’s not that bad. You get used to it. Rita comes to a
decision.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with
you– as an objective witness. Just to see what happens. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, sure. That’d be okay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s not in the wrist so much as the fingers.
Be the hat.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It would take me a year to get good at
this.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is this what you do with eternity?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now you know. It’s like waiting for a bus that
never comes . You should see me play pool – and bowling, juggling, hacky
sack. I can ride a unicycle. There ’ s a knock on the door .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll get it! Phil jumps for the door and opens
it. The PIZZA GUY is there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the delivery
charge, right?</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: U h hh h – Phil pays him, takes the pizza
and closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My favorite .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Of course. I told you, I know everything .</p>
<p>****: I don ’ t think I ’ d want to know everything that ’ s going to
happen. I like to be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s not the worst part.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s the worst part?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The worst part is starting over everyday.
Tomorrow you won’t remember any of this. You’ll go back to treating me
like a complete jerk –</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s not your fault. I am a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, I ’ m not. It really doesn’t make a lot
of difference. I’ve killed myself so many times, I don’t even exist
anymore. I’m just completely empty.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Or completely clean.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If you’re going to be this positive all the
time I may have to rough you up a little.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Wait! Have we done this before?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Which part?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You getting me up here, the card gam e, the
pizza–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, this is the first time.</p>
<p>****: Well?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, what?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well how does it feel to be doing something
completely new? Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and
gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Good. Really good. He takes a slice of pizza
and starts eating with gusto.</p>
<p><strong>the pizza box - later</strong>: There’s only one slice left.
Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not touching.
Soft music is playing on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes.
One to be a great journalist. One to, I don’t know, go back to school,
study art, or auto mechanics. One just to take care of all the busywork,
you know, pay the bills, get my car tuned up. One to be the wild woman
of Borneo. One to be Mother Theresa. Maybe it’s not a curse, Phil. It
all just depends on how you look at it. Phil stares at her for a long
time letting this sink in. Then he belches really loud. Rita stares at
him, then burps surprisingly loud herself.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I want you to know, it’s been a really nice
day for me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Maybe, if it’s not too boring for you, we
could do it again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I hope so. The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs
Phil’s hand. He puts his arm around her. They look into each others’
eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring smile. She squeezes his hand. Their
eyes turn to the clock. 11:;59 turns to 12:00. Rita looks up at Phil as
if expecting some magical event.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re still here!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I thought you were supposed to disappear– or I
was or something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not ’til six.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You rat!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I never said midnight–</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You knew I was waiting for midnight!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But I never said it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, I can’t believe you!</p>
<p>****: I didn’t know this was going to take all night!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Does that mean you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No. Phil takes Rita’s hand. She doesn’t
resist.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the
bed, her head resting on his shoulder. She nods off then catches
herself.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s okay to go to sleep you know. I promise I
won’t touch you– much.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, it’s all right. I’m not tired. What were
you saying? Her eyes start to close again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was saying that the cow was eventually
returned to it’s rightful owner.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s right. He looks at her, sees she’s
truly asleep, and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining
position on the bed. Then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and
settles down next to her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What I was going to say was, I think you’re
the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl I ever met in my
life. She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shhhh. That’s good.</p>
<p>****: I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked
at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever.
iEverytime I -saw you around the station, I thought my heart was going
to explode. I used to dream about us being together. In my dream you
loved me as much as I loved you and we didn’t have to say anything but I
knew you understood everything. She stirs again but he kisses her until
she returns to deep sleep.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know a guy like me could never deserve to
have someone like you, but if I did, I swear I would love you for the
rest of my life. Rita opens her eyes.</p>
<p>****: Did you say something?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Good-night, Rita. He kisses her gently on the
forehead.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Good-night, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>c lose up - the clock</strong>: The time changes from 5:59 to
6:00. The radio starts playing. Phil wakes up alone in bed. He lies
there for a moment then leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads
straight for the shower.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rita? She looks at him without a trace of the
rapport they shared the night before.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh, hi, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thought you might like some– He hands her the
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Careful, it’s hot. Larry? He hands Larry a
cup.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, great.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: We’re just setting up.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know, I bumped into Buster Greene, he kind
of runs this thing, and he tipped me off that we might get a better shot
over there.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I mean, maybe we should go for it. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sounds good to me. Larry?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: All right. Thanks, Phil. Good work. She
reaches for an equipment case.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll get that. Phil helps Larry carry the
camera gear.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You and I never talk, Larry. You got kids?
Larry looks suspicious. Rita looks on, reevaluating Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where would I find the Philosophy section?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Down and to the left, 600’s. Phil walks
through the stacks, past the groundhog window.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I ’ d like a piano lesson, please.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh. Okay, I ’ m with a student now, but –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll give you a thousand dollars. Mary
hesitates only a moment, then ushers Phil into the house and closes the
door. A moment later the door opens and a LITTLE GIRL with an armloa of
music books exits as if pushed. The door closes behind her.</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Buon Giorno, signore.</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Think it ’ 11 be an early Spring?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: “Winter slumbering in the open air wears on
his smiling face a dream of Spring.”</p>
<p><strong>chubby man</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say this is your
first lesson?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Technically, yes. Phil plays on, definitely
improving.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: In fact, the groundhog’s legendary ability to
predict the weather may be more than just the German folklore of the
region. Higher temperatures trigger hormonal changes in the testosterone
levels of male groundhogs, which may in fact wake them from hibernation
and send them out to battle with other males ;for mating rights. So, the
truth is they’re not looking for their shadows, they’re looking for
groundhog chicks. Rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Groundhog Day, February second, also known as
Candlemas Day or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, the
day Mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings following the
birth of the infant Jesus, and celebrated since the Middle Ages by the
sacramental lighting of candles. Hence the old Scottish couplet which
long predates the .American groundhog tradition: “If Candlemas dawns
bright and clear, there’ll be two winters in the year.” Larry whispers
an aside to Rita.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is he making this stuff up?</p>
<p>****: Shhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But what if the rules changed? What if none of
your actions had consequences?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: There would still be an absolute morality.
There has to be an absolute good, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then let me ask
you this. Where does this “absolute good” come from? From the sky?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know. From my freshman Philosophy
course, I guess. They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long
moment and grins.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Nothing. I just can’t believe you’re such a
fine sculptor. Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where do you have to go in Punxsutawney?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I got piano and then drums.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on, I’ll drop you off. They exit.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don’t believe it. I’ve
missed you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Uh, I gotta get going. Nice to see you, Phil.
He hurries off.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How long have you been studying,
Mr. Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: One day. I’m gifted.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, mister. Hey. Come on, let’s get you
somewhere warm. The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There you go. Phil practically carries him out
of the alley.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You the one brought in the old man?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He passed away just now. Phil pauses for a
long moment.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’d he die of?</p>
<p>****: He was just old. It was his time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I want to see his chart. Excuse me. Phil
brushes past her and makes for the big double doors leading to
triage.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir, you can’t – Look! Some people just
die!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not on my watch.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on . Hang on . Hang on , there . Breathe
.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: …When Chekhov saw the long winter, it was a
winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope; and yet, we know winter’s only
one more step in the cycle. And standing among the people of
Punxsutawney –</p>
<p>****: – basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts, I couldn’t
imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter. Phil smiles. Rita
smiles, too.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: For Channel 9 news, I ’ m Phil Connors. There
is much applause. Even Larry brushes away a tear. Phil hands the
microphone to Rita.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry. I’m gonna be late. Phil rushes off.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Late for what? Phil? Could you break it down
and wrap out of here by yourself, Larry?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sure .</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thanks .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey! Did you forget to look both ways? You
didn’t even look one way.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: My doggie was cold.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, well, my doggies are freezing, but I ’ m
still gonna watch out for cars. See you around, kid. Phil looks at his
watch and rushes off. Rita looks on amazed and follows him at a
distance.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Oh, my God! He’s having a heart
attack!</p>
<p><strong>second businessman</strong>: Lay him down!</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: What do I do? He’s not</p>
<p><strong>second businessman</strong>: He’s turning blue! Help! Phil
walks straight up to the BLUE-FACED MAN, grabs him from behind, gets him
in the Heimlich grip and squeezes sharply. A bolus of food flies across
the room. The victim coughs and sputters, then starts breathing
again.</p>
<p><strong>first businessman</strong>: Jerry, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>second businessman</strong>: I think that did it. Phil lets
go of the grateful victim.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If you’re going to eat steak, get better
teeth, will you? Enjoy the rest of your lunch, gents. He exits.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wow. Who was that guy? Phil gets to the door
and finds Rita standing there, looking at him in awe.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p>****: -Okay, hold it right there. I want to know what’ s going on and
I want to know right now.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m really pressed right now. Meet
me outside the hospital about 5:00 and we’ll talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: The hospital? Phil looks at his watch and
rushes away.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Try the curlycue fries. Killer.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Looks like insulin shock. She’s probably
diabetic. Phil enters wearing a doctor’s scrub suit and begins barking
orders.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: She’s not diabetic. It’s an overdose. Let’s
get her up here and pump her stomach, then I want a complete blood
work-up, STAT.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: R i g h t , Doctor–uh– She realizes she’s
never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Call me Phil.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Phil. Like the groundhog?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Make a giraffe!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A giraffe? Let’s see. It’s just like a dog
with a biiiiig– what was it?</p>
<p><strong>all the kids</strong>: Neck!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A big tail? Okay, a big tail.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Neck! A big neck! Phil makes an animal really
quickly. Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There. A dog with long legs.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Nooo ! Long neck !</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh! Right! A dog with a big head.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Noooo! The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling
around on the bed. Rita watches, completely enthralled. Finally, Phil
extricates himself and exits to find Rita waiting.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: All right, now what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on. We have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>ext . residential street - a little later</strong>: Phil
rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him. He stops under a
tree and puts his arms out just as a YOUNG BOY falls out of the tree and
into his arms, knocking him to the ground. The kid runs off unhurt as
Phil gets back to his feet and brushes himself off.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That little bastard has never thanked me once
. I ought to j ust let him fall. Teach him a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phil, this is too – I must be dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, you and me both. Come on, We’re almost
done.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is he – ?</p>
<p><strong>. ’phil</strong>: Yeah. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: In a minute. She waits and watches. The
paramedics, BUD and ANDY, get out of the ambulance and inspect the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s ol1 Really.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look here . Bud picks up the note Phil left.
Rita steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: May I see that? “Every night, by cold
bricks</p>
<p><strong>glow</strong>: I watch the shadow rising from this old man in
the snow. At 8:02 we let it go.”</p>
<p>****: “At 8:02 we let it go.”</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wow, that’s nice. Rita hands him the note and
quickly walks away.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Suppose he wrote it?</p>
<p>****: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on. You’ll see. They enter.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is incredible. Who’s wedding is this?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just some friends. Dorisi The bride, DORIS,
young and cheery, is on her way to see Phil. She is dragging FRED, her
groom, with her.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Hi, Mr. Connors! Come ON, Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: This is the guy I told you about.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How’s it going, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, I ’ d like to thank you for making Doris
go through with this.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are you kidding? Don’t buy that playing hard
to get stuff. She’s crazy about you, you stud.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I ’ m really glad you could come.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Congratulations. Phil reaches into his pocket,
pulls out two tickets and hands them to Doris.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: What is this? Oh, no way! No way! Ahhh! Doris
throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down. Fred grabs the
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wrestlemania! No way! No way! Doris throws
herself on Phil.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’re like going to be in Pittsburgh
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. I just thought about you two,
tried to picture what you ’ d want more than anything in the world and
it came to me. Bing! Wrestlemania.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Connors. You’re a real pal.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: This is the best! Doris gives Phil a kiss.
She and Fred move on.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don ’ t understand . You rush from one
person to the next in a town you only visit once a year, you know
everything before it happens , and you – - I don ’ t know , you seem to
be Punxsutawney ’ s leading citizen. The band finishes a set. The guests
stop dancing and head for the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone
for the moment</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, there’s something going on with you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney on February
second – every day. It’s supernatural. I don’t even try to explain it
anymore. So, I live each day as if it’s the only day I’ve got. Rita
stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only good, true
things.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s pretty amazing. ”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You want to know what’s really amazing? I’ve
been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you
every night of my life. You’ve been my constant weapon against total
despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive. How’s that? Rita
can’t even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said
to anybody. Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Phil! This is the guy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one of Punxsey’s
finest musicians.</p>
<p><strong>�mary</strong>: Give me a break. You should talk. Why don’t
you play something?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: N o , I–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it. Phil looks at
Rita. She nods and shrugs. Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the
piano. He begins to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone
falls silent. It’s so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears. Then, after a
pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a
fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp. Everyone is delighted, and as the rest
of the band kicks in, everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance. An
old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up a
storm.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: That’s a great guy you’ve got there. Doctor
Connors fixed my back, you know.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Do ctor Connors?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait! Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Making a snow man? I’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, stay there. Stand right th ere.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Can I look?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: O kay, look.</p>
<p>****: Nobody’s ever done this for me. Not even a drawing. It’s
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is how I see you. When it all gets too
much, I just close my eyes and there you are– just like this. Take it
home and keep it in the freezer. Rita embraces Phil. They are about to
kiss, looking deep into each others eyes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This one’s for the Frog Prince.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nothing. They kiss– a long, deep,
soul-stirring kiss.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Will you come with me? Rita nods. They
continue standing there, embracing, warming each other in the cold night
air.</p>
<p>****: We’re just going to leave her?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Really, it doesn’t. They
kiss again.</p>
<p><strong>close up - the clock</strong>: The digital clock-radio
changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence. No Sonny and Cher, no deejays–
nothing. Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are
different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed now, he
looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep under the covers.</p>
<p>****: It’s not true. It’s not. It can’t be true. Rita? Rita!</p>
<p>****: Mmmm. Morning. Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with
kisses.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re here! My god! I can’t believe you’re
here!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Glad to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No! It’s happened. Don’t you get it? It’s
tomorrow! It’s – Phil turns on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: . . . still shoveling put the highways, but
if you’re walking, it’s a beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>s idekick</strong>: Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt
h in g up–</p>
<p><strong>deejay</strong>: –except your mouth. Phil kisses the
radio.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I love those guys.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Are you always this jolly in the morning? Phil
runs to the window and looks out.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - the street</strong>: The street ;is virtually
empty, the town just waking up. Kids are throwing snowballs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No groundhog! Rita! They’re all gone!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You must’ve had some dream. Phil stops,
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did I just dream it? Phil opens the door and
runs into the hallway wearing only pajama bottoms.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Phi l? Phil! Rita sits up in bed and waits.
Suddenly, from somewhere else in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the
piano expertly playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
bars.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah!!!! Phil runs back into the room.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It really happened! You’re really here! He
pounces on Rita again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re really actually here.</p>
<p>****: I’m here, I’m here! They kiss, passionately, hungrily.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let’s go! He scoops her up in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Where’re we going?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Anywhere! Everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: Oh, my!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Florence! Say hello to Rita. She loves me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lancaster</strong>: I’m not surprised. He kisses her on
the cheek and rushes out with Rita.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Phil! Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>a lady</strong>: Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s all right. I– A FLORIST steps out of
the flower shop with a bouquet.</p>
<p><strong>florist</strong>: Phil, here. I want you to have these.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thanks, Carl. Phil smells the flowers, and
hands the bouquet to Rita.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And so began my final lifetime, and ended the
longest winter on record. I would find myself no longer able to affect
the chain of events in this town, but I did learn something about time.
You can waste time, you can kill time, you can do time, but if you use
it wisely, there’s never enough of it. So you’d better make the most of
the time you’ve got. A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree.
Phil and Rita rush over to help, but the driver waves that he’s okay.
Rita and Phil continue their walk.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Larry never got through the blizzard, so none
of my groundhog reports ever made it on the air. But Rita and I– we
lived happily ever after. Phil and Rita walk off together. Across the
street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson who is doggedly trying
to sell him insurance.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: But Phil told me you were his accountant!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look, I told you! He’s nuts! Larry keeps
trying to walk away, but Ned won’t leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Let me just tell you about single premium life–
Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned floundering in a
snowbank. Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside that
embraces it.</p>
