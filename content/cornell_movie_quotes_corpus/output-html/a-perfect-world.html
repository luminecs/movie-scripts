<h1 id="a-perfect-world">a-perfect-world</h1>
<p><strong>white screen</strong>: which transforms to a milky white and
eventually into a bright high noon sun. A large black bird flies in
circles overhead. As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - pair of eyes</strong>: to squint, then adjust to
the light and finally open. They look tired, but content, maybe even
relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>superscript: october, 1963.</strong>: A small country town.
Normally quiet at this hour, the street is tonight alive with trick or
treaters dressed as witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual
door to door rounds.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. perry house - night 3</strong>: GLADYS PERRY, 30 going
on 45 due to single motherhood and having worked two fulltime minimum
wage jobs the past ten years, looks out the window with disgust and
pulls the curtains closed.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. perry house - night 4</strong>: Gladys retreats from
the sparsly decorated living room to the predictably drab linoleum
kitchen. At the table, hands on their laps, sit her children, NAOMI and
RUTH, twin girls aged 10, and PHILLIP, a quiet boy of 8.</p>
<p><strong>4 continued: 4</strong>: Gladys sets a casserole on the table
and goes to the frig for a container of milk. The children WHISPER to
one another…</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Judy Baumer is going as a twirler.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: But she’s so fat. I’d go as Cinderella… or
Peter Pan.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Peter Pan’s a boy. Tinker Bell’s a girl.
Phillip could go as Peter Pan… ‘cept you gotta’ fly.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Phillip could go as a bump on a log.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why can’t we go just once?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Caus’ we jus’ can’t, ok?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Our personal beliefs lift us to a higher
place. ’Sides, Halloween is nothing but the Devil’s work.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. front door - night 5</strong>: MR. HUGHES, a
35-year-old family man is playing chaperone to prepubescent versions of
SUPERMAN, TINKERBELL, and a DANCING</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Trick or treat!!!</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: I’m sorry but we don’t take no part in
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hughes</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: We’re Jehovah’s Witness.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hey, Phillip Perry.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Hey, Billy Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: How’d ya’ know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Go eat your supper, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hughes</strong>: Come on, kids. Let’s go to the next
house. Sorry for the bother.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. huntsville state prison - night 6</strong>: A green
Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops. A GUARD steps from his
office to greet the driver, LARRY, a pudgy 55-year-old prison employee
wearing a loud plaid jacket.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Evenin’, Larry. Forget somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Goin’ to Austin tomorrow. Gonna’ take some
work with me.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Work, work, work. When you and me gonna’ go
out and grab a cold one?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sooner the better.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. cell - night 7</strong>: BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old
inmate who reeks with knowledge procured from the wrong side of the
tracks, but whose sad, tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on
the top of a cell bunk chipping at the ceiling. JERRY PUGH, 29, rail
thin, a punk who constantly licks his lips, keeps watch at the door. An
OLD TIMER sits on his bunk and watches both with a cautious eye. Butch
chips through to something.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Damn if the old man ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And this goes to the roof?</p>
<p><strong>old timer</strong>: Used to… afore they walled it over.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If it don’t I’m gonna’ rip your tongue
out.</p>
<p><strong>old timer</strong>: Get yer’ damn hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. neighborhood - night 8</strong>: Superman and Dancing
Skeleton, no longer with adult super- vision, fill water balloons at an
outdoor water spigot.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Make ’em small so you can heave ’em.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. perry house - night 9</strong>: An assembly line at
the kitchen sink as the twins wash and Phillip dries the evening dishes.
Gladys sits at the kitchen table, reading religious pamphlets and
keeping a watchful eye over the process. Several THUDS resound through
the house.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: What in the world?</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. house - night 10</strong>: Superman lofts a BALLOON
and grabs another as the first hits the door of the Perry house and
SPLATTERS.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Bombs away!</p>
<p><strong>skeleton</strong>: Here’s your trick!</p>
<p><strong>11a ext. prison - night 11a</strong>: Butch kicks the top off
a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof. Jerry follows as Butch
shimmies to the wall. At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a
searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light.</p>
<p><strong>11b their pov - green impala 11b</strong>: parked almost
directly below them, next to the Administration office of the
prison.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’n’me must be livin’ right, Butchie
boy!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Let’s get something straight. I don’t like
you. As soon as we’re on our way, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Who said I liked you?</p>
<p><strong>12 int. admin office - night 12</strong>: A SOFT THUD causes
a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing,
files in hand, waving goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Have a safe trip now, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. yard - night 13</strong>: Just as Larry reaches the
Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down and land on him. The spotlight showers
them in a flash of light as it passes by. Butch cups his hand over
Larry’s mouth while Jerry reaches into his jacket – Bingo – a shiny
.38.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Keep yer’ mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Gawd I’d love to blow yer’ head off.</p>
<p><strong>14 ext. prison gate - night 14</strong>: Larry, driving with
his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate and waves a palm at the
Guard, who opens without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: ’Night, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. car - floorboard - night 15</strong>: stuffed and
hidden half on the floor and half under the mats are Jerry and
Butch.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: ’Night, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>16a int. small, well-lit diner - night 16a</strong>: A
weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: B-5. Haven’t heard that one in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Not since last night. How’s the pie?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Kinda rubbery. It was better yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Same pie as yesterday. Not much call for
rhubarb. Sell one slice a day.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin’ ’em
would you still come by every night?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Naw, Red Garnett, you don’t come in here for
the coffee and pie. You come in here for the company. To see me.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong>: Now that I’ve said that, I’ll go one better.
What say I cook you dinner at my place sometime? Steaks, baked taters,
cold beer, the works. Well?… I’m askin’ you out.</p>
<p><strong>16c int./ext. patrol car - night 16c</strong>: Red pulls up
in front of a small house in a residential section of town. Police cars
are everywhere and several officers are behind their vehicles, guns
pointed at the house. Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a
POLICE SERGEANT, about the same age as Red.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Long time, no see. What are you doin’
here, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Couldn’t sleep. Whattaya got?</p>
<p><strong>16c continued: 16c</strong>: They walk. Red arrives at a
truck with a 10 gallon coffee urn roped to the tailgate. He grabs a
paper cup and pours.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Guy holdin’ his family hostage. She kicked
him out, served him divorce papers, he came back drunk and pulled a .38.
Fired two shots but we don’t think anybody’s hit. Actually you might
know the guy from your sheriff days. Hayden Webb. Been on suspension for
awhile. Ring any bells?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. Lemme talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No can do. Police jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: And how are you guys doin’?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: We got specific rules to follow in these
kinda situations, Red. He won’t talk. Jus’ keeps yellin’, crying and
waving his gun around.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: At least use the megaphone, you stubborn
jackass!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together
a few years back. Mind if I come in?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: ‘Evenin’, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Leave it to the P.D. They got a three- ring
circus out there and not one cup of hot coffee. You mind?</p>
<p><strong>16d int. webb house - night 16d</strong>: On the couch sits
Hayden’s wife, JULIE, cradling her two kids, an infant and an 8-year-old
boy. Julie sobs. Her eye and temple are bruised purple. Red slowly
enters, nods to Julie, takes off his hat and sets it on a lampstand.
Hayden has moved away from Red against the wall. He holds the gun out at
no one in particular.</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Julie, put a pot of coffee on.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Appreciate it. Jus’ what is it you want,
Hayden?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: I dunno… I want my job. I want my
family.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What’d they suspend you for?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: I answer a call in South Austin. Girl
gettin’ raped, that’s the word. I bust in the door, this lowlife is
beatin’ the shit outta her with a tire iron. ‘Help me, help me,’ she
says. I take the guy down. He bites me. I break his arm. Case closed,
right? No. She was his wife and they both sue me and the department. The
guy’s about to kill her and she sues me ‘cause now he can’t pump gas.
They have chump change in the bank but they got the best lawyer in town.
Three months I’m goin’ crazy. No pay. Then my wife leaves me and I get
served divorce papers by John Reese – a sheriff’s man. You know how
embarrassin’ that is? What’s happenin’, Chief? I mean, everybody’s got a
fuckin’ lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You love her? Love the kids?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then why do you hit me!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You don’t wanna shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: I swear to God I think I do.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Naw, Hayden, I don’t think so. I think you love
her. You know what else I think? That you’d like a way out of this whole
mess… That’s where I come in.</p>
<p><strong>16e ext. house - night 16e</strong>: Sergeant and other cops
stand around and watch the house.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: The front door opens and Julie emerges
with her two kids. She takes a few cautious steps, then runs to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>16f int. house - night 16f</strong>: Red sits on the coffee
table, unloading Hayden’s gun. He opens the cylinder and drops the
shells to the floor. A calmer Hayden exits the kitchen with Red’s
coffee. Red accepts it, takes a sip.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hits the spot.</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: No cuffs, huh, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Okay. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We’ll walk out together, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Any good officer has a back-up.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Lemme have it, Hayden.</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Was I a good officer, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Was I a good deputy? The kinda man you could
depend on to do what’s right?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hayden</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>16g ext. house - night 16g</strong>: Hayden’s dead, covered
body is carried out the door. Julie screams and sobs, still holding her
crying children.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Got a call, Chief Garnett. They’re lookin’ for
ya downtown.</p>
<p><strong>17 int. convenience store - night 17</strong>: It’s a small
town version of a 7-11, kept open by an owner anxious to cash in on the
later night munchies of beer drinkers. Good idea. Bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>17 continued: 17</strong>: Jerry skims through a girly
magazine, turning the pages with the gun. Butch, wearing Larry’s plaid
jacket, jimmies open the cash register. He looks to the floor then to…
Jerry, who catches Butch’s gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor,
then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to the skin mag. Butch
holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops
over the counter and out of the store. Jerry notices Butch leaving,
grabs a handful of assorted Brach’s candies and hurries after.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, wait up!</p>
<p><strong>18 int. d.p.s. - texas rangers headquarters - night
18</strong>: It’s very late, after midnight, and only a handful of
people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices. A
light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye. A MUFFLED
VOICE over the phone…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I understan’ your concern, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. red’s office - night 19</strong>: Red, behind a huge
ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper, sips coffee with one hand,
works a buffalo nickel through magician’s paces with the other and
balances the phone receiver in the crook of his neck.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Cons are creatures o’ habit. Like old coyotes,
they’ll crawl back into familiar holes. Uh huh… Yeah… Sure yer’ right.
Listen you go back to bed and I’ll call you in the A.M. with an update.
I’ll have the files by then. Say hullo to the Mrs..</p>
<p><strong>20 int. perry house - night 20</strong>: The CLANGING wind up
alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it
with a touch. She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily
ritual required of her.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. perry living room - night 21</strong>: As the kitchen
light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in
which all three children sleep. The twins sleep soundly but Phillip
tosses and turns away from the light.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. neighborhood - night 22</strong>: The Impala creeps
through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. impala - night 23</strong>: Butch drives while Jerry
scours the block.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There’s a Buick.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t want a Buick. Want a Ford.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ford’s leak oil. A car’s a car.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Then take the Buick.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Soon as we cross state line I’ll do just
that. I’m tired of riding around. I’ll check down the block… for a
Ford!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: as he checks one locked car, then feeling
eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a
corner. BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the
door without a sound.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. perry kitchen - night 24</strong>: Gladys steps into
a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet. By rote she
salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. perry backyard - someone’s pov - night 25</strong>:
FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we see Gladys
at work. Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags a
chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by
buttering the toast.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your
sisters.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I take mine fried.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. kitchen - night 26</strong>: Gladys gasps at Jerry’s
face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes
the pistol. He motions for her to open the back door. She does. He
slides into the room and sits down at the table.</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. on street - night 27</strong>: A Ford sits in a
driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME,
looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No
luck. He rises and looks to the light.</p>
<p><strong>28 int. kitchen - night 28</strong>: Jerry stuffs a piece of
toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: A lil’ on the bland side. Gimme’ that
ketchup.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t got a man around here, do ya’?</p>
<p><strong>29a int. neighbor’s house - night 29a</strong>: MR. CUMMINGS,
70, puts on his glasses and peers through the window.</p>
<p><strong>29b his pov - perry kitchen 29b</strong>: Gladys sits on
Jerry’s lap, thanks to .38 caliber coercion. The convict’s hands move
freely over the frightened woman’s body.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Feed me, sweet thing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well lookie here, you do got a man!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m bleedin’! You happy?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What’s your name, boy?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Ph… Phillip…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick up
that pistola.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Shut yer’ mouth. Pick it up and bring it over
here.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: Phillip reaches down and slowly
picks up the gun by the handle. He takes one step toward Butch, then
another. Gladys, petrified, sobs. Phillip arrives armslength from
Butch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now say ‘stick ’em up.’</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Stick ’em up…</p>
<p><strong>mr. cummings</strong>: Standing outside the screen door, gun
leveled. Before the old man can utter a syllable, Butch grabs Phillip
and points the gun straight at Cummings. Jerry jumps up and grabs
Gladys.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Put the gun down, old timer. You couldn’t hit
me anyway. Probably shoot the boy.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Leave it be.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Mama?…</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: It’s all right, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You deaf?!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Set it on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We gotta’ get the hell outta’here!</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: PHONE still RINGS…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I vote we bring her with us.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How we gonna’ get outta’ here without a
hostage, tell me that? The whole goddam neighborhood’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’ll take the boy.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Nooooo!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You’ll get him back. I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. front yard - dawn 31</strong>: Butch, carrying
Phillip, and Jerry emerge from the back of the house and race back to
the Impala.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Phillip!!!!…</p>
<p><strong>32 int. car - dawn 32</strong>: Jerry FIRES a SHOT over their
heads, sending them to the deck or scurrying for safety.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ain’t you folks ever heard of sleepin’
in?!!</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. perry yard - dawn 33</strong>: Cummings races from
behind the house with the SHOTGUN, levels it and FIRES a BLAST… A nearby
station wagon WINDOW SHATTERS. Rising from their cover position, its
owners look at Cummings with disgust.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Nice shootin’, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>34 int. red’s office - day 34</strong>: Garnett, still in the
same clothes, rests the phone receiver in his ear while he shuffles
through the files before him. Red’s deputy and boy friday, TOM ADLER,
40, lank, thinning hair, with a face as soft as Red’s is hard, warms up
Red’s coffee with a jolt from the Chief’s favorite plaid Thermos.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes, Johnny, I do understand that…</p>
<p><strong>insert - files</strong>: The first is Jerry’s, complete with
a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner. There are several
pages in the file, but Red’s fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet
before turning to…</p>
<p><strong>insert - second file</strong>: It’s Butch’s and again Red’s
fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo
of Butch at the top of the page.</p>
<p><strong>red’s face</strong>: A hint of recognition. The jabbering
continues…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - photo of butch</strong>: A little younger than now.
A younger con with the grim facade of a man facing hard time.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the
phone conversa- tion he’s “not having”.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Red? Red, you there?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Red?….</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: He’s talkin’ to ya’.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Have you heard a word I’ve said?!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah, Johnny. Jus’ thinkin’ is all….</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Press has been waiting almost an hour,
Red.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah…. Clear as a bell… Mi’ sabe.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: The Guvner’, Red.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Reminded me it’s an election year.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You drink before noon?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Uh… no.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Good. Last one I had was on a liquid diet.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Last what?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Penny Munroe.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I believe you have me confused. I’m here from
Huntsville. Assigned by Governor Connally.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Adler… what is this?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Rings a bell, Red. Believ’ they sent us
something about her this mornin’…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who sent?…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: … Guvner’, Red.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: … Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Uh, I’m Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the
State Prison System.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Tom Adler. Deputy. State Police… System.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s a relatively new procedure but I was
assigned by Governor Connally…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … ‘to work with State law enforcement officials
in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State
Police.’ It don’t say nuthin’ about…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: … It includes parole and work release
programs as well as penal escape situations.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: On our way, Marge.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Gettin’ antsy, Red. You scheduled it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The idea is that an understanding of the
particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help
the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations
could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to
apprehension.</p>
<p><strong>34 continued: 34</strong>: Adler stares at Sally then turns
to Red with a “never heard the like” look of amazement on his face. Red,
roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten
gallon hat, makes his way to the door. But, before he exits…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In the first place, Miss Gerber.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Sally, please.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In the first place, Sally, it ain’t a ‘penal
escape situation.’ It’s a manhunt. Fancy words in a circle don’t help
much.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And what does?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an
antenna and one helluva lot of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. press room - day 35</strong>: A throng of photogs and
news writers stuff the undersized room. The clamor settles when Red
enters and steps behind the lectern.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Listen up, I’ll only say it once. At
approximately ten o’clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville,
Robert ‘Butch’ Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air
shaft, grabbed a prison employee’s car and got out through the main
gate. At approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed a market outside of
Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store’s owner.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Is the prison employee with them?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Was when they left the prison.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: What’s the rap sheet on these guys
like?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Long as Christmas eve to a kid. Haynes was
doin’ 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin’ 20 hisself for
manslaughter and assorted parole vios.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Is there any indication of…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … Lemme’ finish, Billy. This mornin’ another
hostage was taken… from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8.
Grabbed him out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yer’ askin’ if they’re preverts. Well, one
is.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: You got inter-agency cooperation on
this?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm
of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being
taken. But I doubt they’re out of bed yet.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Red, how do you plan to apprehend the
escapees?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Officially I can only say we have a full
manhunt team on their trail and we’ll proceed with due haste.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: And unofficially?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Unoffically? I’m gonna’ hunt ’em like the rabid
dogs they are.</p>
<p><strong>35 continued: 35</strong>: Every hand in the place shoots up
and Ad Lib questions fly like bullets.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s all I’ve got but I’d like to introduce
ya’ to Miss Sally Gerber. She’s straight from the Governor’s office.
Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have
some questions for her.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Look, fellas, I got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You have a question?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You doin’ anything tonight?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I’m serious!</p>
<p><strong>36 int. impala - day 36</strong>: Butch is driving with
Phillip in the front seat beside him, still in his underwear. Jerry, in
the backseat, leers at Butch, aims out the window and FIRES ONCE.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. field near road - day 37</strong>: An aluminum water
tank spews a violent leak.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We got a handful of caps and yer’ shootin’
water tanks. He’s a smart guy, huh, Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. parking lot - day 39</strong>: Red is finishing up
with several reporters near the door to the parking lot. Adler jumps in,
holds up his hands.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: All right, that’s it, boys. Chief’s got work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>’60-style airstream mobile home</strong>: parked in the
middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new Chevy truck. The
Airstream is painted in state colors and sports banners, decals and
logos.</p>
<p><strong>40 ext. parking lot - day 40</strong>: Saunders follows Red
as he walks around the showpiece, occasionally kicking a tire or
two.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: So whattaya’ think?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: We are very proud of this baby. Governor
Connally special ordered it so state officials and dignitaries can ride
in the parade in Dallas. You know President Kennedy’s comin’?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So I hear.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Latest technology, oversized engine,
complete kitchen and sleeping quarters, gun racks, frig, stove, the
works. Even got a hot line phone straight to the Governor’s office.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Fine piece of machinery.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: What’s more, as soon as it gets back from
Dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal. Perfect for lots of
situations – a headquarters on wheels.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Uh, Chief?….</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Whattaya’ doin’, Red?! Stop takin’
pictures!</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: It’s jus’ not possible, Red. The
Governor’s gonna’ ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Guvner’ hisself told me this manhunt was top
priority.</p>
<p><strong>40 continued: 40</strong>: Adler moves through the door to
the RV carrying Red’s favorite desk chair. He’s followed by BOBBY LEE,
20’s, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: S’cuse me. This here’s Bobby Lee. He’s a
specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Please, Red, ya’ gotta’ believe me…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Dick Suttle, the driver.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Not anymore. Bradley.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: This man stays with the vehicle wherever
it goes, Red!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You know how to operate the gadgets?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Grab a seat.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Please Red, I’m beggin’. I mean, what am I
suppose to tell the Governor?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out
on it.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a
scratch!</p>
<p><strong>airstream</strong>: about 20 yards down the way, comes to a
stop. A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks
toward the bus but when she arrives at the door… … LAUGHTER filters out
of the Airstream. The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. Sally
waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and,
against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes
getting heavier by the minute. Again, when she gets close…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You comin’ or not?</p>
<p><strong>42 int. airstream - day 42</strong>: Sally enters, balancing
the boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling Red, a
grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll, a nervous KAISER, the
radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty smirk from Bobby Lee. When the
Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the
boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil
eye.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’ve got shit on your face.</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. rural road - day 43</strong>: The IMPALA BLASTS
along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light
township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to
a stop near a pay phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why the hell we stoppin’?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You said you had a cousin near here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So give him a call. See if we can shack there
til’ things cool down.</p>
<p><strong>44 continued: 44</strong>: In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to
the phone booth and pore through a thin directory. Phillip steals a
glance at Butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why’d he take the keys?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So I won’t leave him.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Would you leave him?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Musta’ moved. Prolly’ couldn’t have heard ‘em
anyway. Goddam ear’s still bleedin’. You ever try that shit again…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You were in the middle of threatenin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ain’t a threat. It’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Here kid, take the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: In two seconds I’m gonna’ break your nose.
That’s a threat…</p>
<p><strong>44 continued: 44</strong>: Before Jerry has time to snicker
Butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from
Jerry’s nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch
spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: … And that’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m gonna’ kill you for that.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And that’s a threat. Beginnin’ to understand
the difference?</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. rural store - day 45</strong>: The Impala brakes to a
dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay
field.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Okay, Phillip, listen up. I’m gonna’ run in
here and get some smokes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Get beer.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Here, hold it like this…. And point it right
between his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What the hell?…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If he so much as moves you pull the trigger …
right here… Put your finger on it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yer’ a fuckin’ crazy man.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And that’s a fact. I believe yer gettin’ the
hang of this.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. store - day 47</strong>: Butch enters. A short fat
man with a fishing cap is sweeping up.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: How-do. Where’s yer’ sodees?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hot in the first aisle. Cold in the back, in
the cooler.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. impala - day 48</strong>: Phillip’s slightly shaking
hands hold the pistol pointed directly at Jerry’s head.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You ever shot a gun before, boy?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Powww!!!… It’ll knock you on your ass.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Be quiet, mister.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Naw. You ain’t never shot no gun before.
Livin’ in a house with three split tails… no Daddy around. You’ll
prolly’ grow up queer, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Now I’m gonna’ lean up here real slow, okay?
So we can talk.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There we go. Now we can have a ‘man to man.’
You are a man, ain’t ya’?</p>
<p><strong>49 int. store - day 49</strong>: Butch dumps a six pack of RC
Colas, a handful of Moon Pies, a handful of beef jerky and some gum on
the counter.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. impala - day 50</strong>: Jerry’s chin is on the
front seat now and his arms are draped over it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Those are cute little underwears you got
there, boy. Say does your mama sew yer’ name in ’em, initials or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whatcha’ got in there?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Kinda’ puny, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The hand is quicker than the eye.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That sonofabitch. Hell’s bells, no
shells.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. store - day 51</strong>: The Old Man puts down his
broom and ambles to the register.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: This be all for ya’?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: This and a carton of Chesterfields. Are those
.38 shells? Gimme a box.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: With deposit comes to four dollars
eighty.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Land’s sake. What line of work you in?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Used cars. Buy ‘em, fix ’em up. Sold a
Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. impala - day 52</strong>: Jerry puts his gun hand
around Phillip’s neck and pulls the sobbing boy closer. Jerry rests his
face on Phillip’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come over a little closer.</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. field - day 53</strong>: Phillip, still sobbing, runs
for his life in the hay, which is a full foot taller than he.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally,
gives chase, whistling as if calling for a lost puppy.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m gonna’ find you boy. You best come
here.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: gun in hand, stumbles, falls, gets up,
keeps running. He falls again and crawls to a stop. He wipes his tears
and balls up on the ground trying to make himself invisible.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. store - day 54</strong>: Butch exits with a grocery
sack. When he sees the car doors open he dumps the groceries in the
front seat and looks to the field.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the
field.</p>
<p><strong>55 ext. field - day 55</strong>: Jerry, crouching, moves
through the field – eyes peeled for any sign of Phillip. Phillip lies
still. He hears the hay rustling near him and he looks up, squares his
body and points the revolver at…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: a little frustrated now, but still moving
forward.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey boy. Hey boy. You better hope I don’t
find ya’.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whatcha’ gonna’ do? Hit me with it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Me’n you are friends!!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Thick as theives.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: hears a GUNSHOT and runs for his life back
toward the store.</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. parked impala - day 56</strong>: Phillip runs to the
car and hides behind the tire opposite the store and field. In the b.g.
we see Butch emerge from the field and walk toward the car. The Old Man,
who also heard the shot, emerges from the store with a baseball bat.
Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old Man and levels the revolver at
him. Phillip is relieved when he hears Butch’s voice instead of
Jerry’s.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You got a phone?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Then go inside and lie down til’ we’re
gone.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well… Get in.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. highway - day 57</strong>: The truck and Airstream
barrel down the highway.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. airstream - day 58</strong>: The place is a
functioning mobile headquarters now. Adler on the short wave and tacking
up a map, Bobby Lee still in his corner, Red and Sally sitting across
from one another at the “kitchen table”.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Got a spot on ’em. A store right outside of
Benhur. About 20 miles from here.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: All right. Push the roadblock on 288 north by
50 miles.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Ya’ figger’ they’re that far along?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hell, I dunno’and neither do they. They’re jus’
happy to be out. It’s a high speed Sunday drive to them.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard you
use that one before, Red.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Somethin’ eatin’ at you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s… perhaps premature, but do you have an
auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What makes you so sure they won’t stay
together?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You got somethin’ to say, spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Their situation is one of accommodation. They
won’t be together long.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is a
criminal’s criminal – armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on
the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty
crime. They’ll split sheets soon.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What about the hostages? They gonna’ flip a
coin to see who gets to keep who?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s happened before. Either way it’s a
dilemma they’ll address soon. That’s why we should address it now.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We don’t have a dilemma. And neither do they.
They’ll keep one hostage… and get rid of one, if they haven’t
already.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Okay… which one?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: If there’s a SNAFU, who’s John Q. Public more
likely to give a rat’s ass about – an innocent boy or a goddam
bureaucrat.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. motor home - back office 59</strong>: Red sits in his
office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours Geritol from a bottle into
his coffee. He doesn’t even look up when Sally enters, a stern look on
her face.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We need to talk, Chief Garnett.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Call me Red.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Red. Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing
me?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m hell-bent on one thing. You hang around
long enough you’ll find that out. Til’ then a tough backside and a sense
of humor will get you through a lot.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I have a fine sense of humor, but the one
thing I won’t do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch
of morons who think you’re some kind of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>59 continued: 59</strong>: Red sips from the mug calmly then
groans, his face contorted.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Awful. Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya’ young,
but I’m not sure it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’d like an answer.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: This yer’ first time out of an office?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Thought so. What’d ya’ expect ya’ signed on
for?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You think I’m what? Some dumb schoolgirl who
wandered into the boy’s locker room? Well you’re wrong. I don’t mean to
boast, but I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people
involved in this fiasco.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Didn’t ask that. Asked what you expected.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I expected to be allowed to do the job
assigned to me by the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail
together every year. But deep down he and I know that win, lose or draw
this is my ship, not his.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The Governor as chief executive officer of
this state bears ultimate responsibility for…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … Bullshit. Responsibility lies with the one
that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers. This mess turns bloody –
and it might – all it’s gonna cost the Governor is a few votes! Me, I’m
the one that’s…</p>
<p><strong>59 continued: 59</strong>: Red catches himself about to get
too personal. He takes another swig of his coffee/geritol. Sally softens
her stance.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re the one that what?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell ya’ what. You think I’m makin’ a wrong
turn you speak up. Might not agree, but I’ll listen. As far as stepped
on toes and wounded pride, I’ll buy everyone a drink when we head for
home. Not until. I got more to worry about. That sound fair to you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well okay then.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So who’s the other one?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Other one?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: If yer’ one brain, who’s the other?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Haynes. He was tested in prison.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. impala - day 60</strong>: Butch drives and catches an
occasional glance at Phillip who sits quietly, but who, too, steals
looks at his captor between swigs of RC Cola. He finishes off the
bottle. Butch reaches in the sack for another, pops the top on the
dashboard and hands it to Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Thankyew. Are you gonna’ shoot me?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No. Me’n you are friends.</p>
<p><strong>60 continued: 60</strong>: Butch realizes that in Phillip’s
eyes he and Jerry were probably friends.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If I was choosin’ a runnin’ buddy, I’d take
you over him any day of the week.</p>
<p><strong>61 ext. rural store - day 61</strong>: The RV slides to a
stop in the gravel parking lot which is full of state and local police.
Red exits first, followed by the others. A LOCAL SHERIFF walks up to
greet.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We got a positive I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>local sheriff</strong>: Yessir, with only the boy as hostage.
But not five minutes ago we found something else.</p>
<p><strong>62 ext. hay field - day 62</strong>: PAN FROM a fingertip UP
an arm and TO the face of Jerry Pugh. A clean bullethole has left him
with a third eye, a bloody back and an entourage of late summer flies.
We hear the CLICK of a photographer’s CAMERA. BOOM UP TO Red, Local
Sheriff and other bystanders.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Least now we know who’s in charge.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. impala - day 63</strong>: Butch notices that Phillip
is pretty somber as he tugs on another RC.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Whattaya’ thinkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If I guess you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You thinkin’ about yer mama?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I hear ya’, Phillip, but look around. I can’t
very well leave you here, can I?</p>
<p><strong>64 ext. rural road - day 64</strong>: The Impala rests in the
fork of a dirt road.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Lemme’ ask you somethin’. You right or left
handed?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Then that’s the way we’ll go. You ever ridden
in a time machine before?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Sure you have. Whattaya’ think this is?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: A car.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yer’ lookin’ at this thing bassackwards. This
is a 20th Century time machine. I’m the captain and you’re the
navigator.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Out there… that’s the future.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Back there… that’s the past. If life’s moving
too slow and you wanna’ project yerself into the future you step here on
the gas. See?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And if yer’ enjoyin’ the moment yer’ in, well
hell, just step on the brake here and you can slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>65 continued: 65</strong>: Butch brings the car to a complete
and dusty stop.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: This is the present, Phillip. Enjoy it while
it lasts.</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. road - day 66</strong>: The Impala spins out, kicking
dirt in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yessir. Time travelin’ through Texas! We got
to find us a Ford. My daddy always drove Fords, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>67 int. airstream - day 67</strong>: The Airstream sits in
the parking lot of the store. Bradley and Suttle sit up front in the
truck.</p>
<p><strong>int. truck - day</strong>: Bradley turns the knob on an
intercom speaker system next to the radio.</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: It’s an intercom speaker system. You can get
and give instructions to and from the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: How’s it work?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: You push the power button but if you’ve got
the volume turned up…</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: … you’ll blow the speakers. Sheeeit…</p>
<p><strong>int. airstream - day</strong>: Red cringes, his ears still
ringing from the squawk, and turns to stare at the front of the RV.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: This thing’s prolly’ got a warranty. You
oughta’ make a list of all the things that are wrong.</p>
<p><strong>int. airstream - day</strong>: Red shakes his head and stands
in front of the map, placing thumbtacks at crossroads indicated by the
circle mark.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: That oughta’ put his pecker in a sling, huh,
Red? Sorry, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Shouldn’t these be roadblocked as well?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sooner or later he’ll get on a main road. We
don’t got the manpower to roadblock every farm to market.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: In a perfect world, Miss Gerber, we’d lock
arms and thrash the bush til’ he turned up…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: In a perfect world things like this wouldn’t
happen in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Locals are heading out. Wanna’ follow?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Let’s sit tight. He’ll turn up.</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. rural road - day 68</strong>: The Impala travels
slowly along the road until it edges to a stop by the entrance to a
small farmhouse with a truck and car parked in a long dirt driveway. A
farmer on a combine works a small field.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Ok, Phillip, we’re gonna do some car
shoppin’. You ever play cowboys n’ Injuns? See that Ford sedan? Now I
want you to sneak on over there like an Injun and take a peek and see if
the keys is in it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t have to if you don’t wanna… but I’d
appreciate it… You bein’ the new navigator and all.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. farmhouse - day 70</strong>: Phillip, still in his
skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from his escape from Jerry, sneaks up
to the car and quietly peers into the open window. The keys dangle when
his small hand touches them. Phillip closes the door, looks around and
then runs pell-mell to the passenger window of the Impala.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s got keys and a radio. I checked.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Good man.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Can we stop at a fillin’ station.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Number one.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: This here’s nature, Phillip. Pee in the
ditch.</p>
<p><strong>70 continued: 70</strong>: The FARMER stops his tractor and
notices Butch and Phillip. Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having
trouble coaxing relief. Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal
and turns the key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES. The Farmer is walking
now, slowly and then at a trot as he realizes what’s happening. Phillip
finally starts to pee. Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is
flooded.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Start, you sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Hey, that’s my car! Hey!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Get in the car, Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip! Get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>71 int. ford - day 71</strong>: The CAR is SCREECHING down
the road but the Farmer holds on for dear life and auto. He claws at
Phillip, who does his best to fend off flailing hands and fingers. Butch
reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol. Phillip sees what’s
about to happen and bites the Farmer’s hand as hard as he can.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Aaaaaayyyyyy!!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Goddam, boy, how many RC’s did you drink
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: One thing’s for sure. You got one helluva set
of chompers.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. truck - day 72</strong>: Sitting still. Bradley tries
to light a cigarette with the lighter but gets no heat.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Lighter don’t work. Put that on the
list.</p>
<p><strong>int. airstream - day</strong>: Bobby Lee sits alone in the
back corner of the main room of the RV. He just sits and stares,
occasionally smiling cynically at Sally.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Highway 16 north. Four miles south of
Desdemona. Got it. Stole a vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What kinda’ shape’s it in?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The Ford he stole.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Owner told the locals they only drove it to
church, but it does have a bad emergency brake. How’d ya’ know it was a
Ford?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He likes Fords.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Looks like you was right, Red. He’s off the
farm to market and onto a spur. Whattaya’ wanna’ do?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Beef up the I-20 roadblock.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What’s that? Red, the locals wanna’ know if
they’re to take a clean shot if they get one?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Come back…? Come back Mobile One.
Adler, are you there…?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell ’em what I said.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Uh… no.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Was that a negative?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: No, er, yes. No means negative. Same thing.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t want some half-ass Sergeant York taking
pot shots with a deer rifle.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s the only thing to do. He’s got the child
with him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: I suppose you figger’ he’ll jus’ give
up.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Well now there’s a safe bet.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ll give you a safe bet. The boy’s in better
hands now than he was.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The third eye Pugh’s sportin’ on the way to the
morgue shouts otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Then why not shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: They’ve forwarded the stolen vehicle license
to the roadblocks. You still wanna’ go to the farm?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. I gotta’ hunch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You got blue eyes don’tcha’, Phillip? Never
met a blue-eyed Phillip before. Who you named after?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: My daddy.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You and your old man get along all right?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeahsir.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Toss the ball around, play grab-ass in the
yard, that sorta’ thing?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Nawsir.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: He ain’t around, really.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well he is or he ain’t. When’s the last time
you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Me’n you got a lot in common, Phillip. The
both of us got blue eyes, we both like RC Cola and neither one of us has
an old man worth a damn.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: My Mama says he’ll prolly’ come back.
Prolly’ when I’m ten or so.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well… she’s lyin’ to ya’ pure and simple. He
ain’t never comin’ back.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Guys like us, Phillip, we gotta’ be on our
own. Seek foolish destiny, that sorta’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. gas station - day 74</strong>: The Ford pulls off the
dusty road and into the lone pump in this dilapidated petrol mirage. A
BUCK TOOTH BOY, 15, in overalls steps to the window.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What can I do ya’ for?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Tell him your name.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Fill-er-up it is.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: See there! All you gotta’ do is say your name
and people are waiting on you hand and foot. Like a goddam king or
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. farmhouse - day 75</strong>: Bradley and Suttle lean
against the parked RV, chatting.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: You responsible for engine maintenance on
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Uh, yeah. I’m the full time driver.</p>
<p><strong>75 continued: 75</strong>: Bradley shakes his head. “Too
bad”.</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: You notice how it keeps wanting to slip a
bit goin’ into second. Feels to me like somebody’s been a little
heavy-footed with the clutch. I’d take care of that if I was you.</p>
<p><strong>pan to</strong>: an ambulance door opens and the Farmer,
strapped in, is rolled toward it as his wife, sobbing, attends to
him.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: No bodies this time, thank Gawd.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You got the keys to this thing?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Uh… naw…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Get me a crowbar. You might wanna’ wait in the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>76a int. trunk - day 76a</strong>: But it’s black as night. A
CROWBAR CRANKS at the lock until the trunk blasts open like a bottletop.
A blast of light gives way to the silhouetted faces of Red, Adler and
Sally, who turns and walks away in nauseous disgust.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well….</p>
<p><strong>their pov - open trunk</strong>: In it lies the crumpled,
bent, bloody remains of Larry, the prison employee, the original
hostage.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … there’s our bureaucrat.</p>
<p><strong>76b red 76b</strong>: spits a chaw, turns and walks to the
RV. Near the entrance Sally is heaving.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s sure nice to know the boy’s in good
hands.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Gallows humor, Sally. Without it we’d all be
heavin’.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. small town - day 77</strong>: The Ford slides down
the Main Street and into a side alley next to a Department Store.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You ready to get out of those skivvies and
into some britches?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well all right then. But first we gotta’ come
up with some A.K.A.’s, fake identities, ya’ know. Names to call each
other when we’re around other folks. Go ahead and think one up. Whatever
name you want.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Any name I want?</p>
<p><strong>79 ext. store front - establishing - day 79</strong>: A small
time Dry Goods store with a sign over the entrance proclaiming:
“FRIENDLY’S - The Friendliest Store in Texas!”</p>
<p><strong>80 int. friendly’s - day 80</strong>: A small, well-organized
country dry goods store with a dozen or so aisles carrying everything
from DDT to used boots.</p>
<p><strong>80 continued: 80</strong>: A long counter at the front of the
store is backed by a small office with a large glass window that gives
the Manager, MR. WILLITS, 45, bespectacled, anal-retentive, a clear view
of the store. A nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as
Butch and Phillip enter. Butch holds the door open and smiles at them.
They say “thanks” but can’t help but notice Phillip, cowering behind
Butch, still clad in his underwear. He hides behind a nearby display
which reads: Cast Your Vote For Friendly’s Friendliest Clerk! A clerk,
LUCY, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices their entrance. She’s
schoolmarmish with a smile that looks like it’s painted on.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, hello there and welcome to Friendly’s.
Looks like the little fella’ needs some pants.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: As a matter of fact. Shoes and new skivvies,
too. He’ll tell you his size. Go with the lady, Buzz.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Buzz!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Buzz, what a cute name. Like a bee.</p>
<p><strong>children’s aisle</strong>: Lucy is holding jeans up to
Phillip’s waist.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’d be easier if I knew your size, but we’ll
get it right.</p>
<p><strong>halloween costume display</strong>: on a circular rack with
shelves. Hanging prominantly is a Casper the Friendly Ghost costume.
Above it a sign reads: “MARKED DOWN - Get the Jump on Next Year!”</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: mesmerized by the display.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: takes a roll of electrician’s tape. He tears
off a strip, attaches it to the back or his hand and tugs. It holds
tight.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: wearing the Casper mask.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Why look. It’s a friendly ghost. Say
‘Boo.’</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Boo.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Not very scary but you’ll have a whole year to
work on it if your Daddy lets you have it. Good price, too. What’d you
go as this year?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: A bandit.</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. main street - day 81</strong>: A local police car
cruises slowly, spots the Ford parked in the alley and comes to a
halt.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. police car - day 82</strong>: The cop, TERRANCE, 25,
who only started last month after he flunked out of Texas A&amp;M,
checks the plates against a notepad on his dash.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Aw… shit…</p>
<p><strong>83 int. friendly’s - day 83</strong>: Butch, with a handful
of supplies, including the rope and tape, makes his way to the
register.</p>
<p><strong>83 continued: 83</strong>: He’s greeted there by PAULA, to
whom he earlier winked. She’s 25, country cute, and wears a fake smile
that rivals Lucy’s. Butch reaches for and tries on a pair of
sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Whattaya’ think?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Look good.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Will that be all for you today?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You folks are about the grinninest bunch I
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Old Man Willits holds a contest ever’ month.
The friendliest clerk gets a $20 bonus. There’s a ballot box at the
front.</p>
<p><strong>behind glass</strong>: Mr. Willits adjusts his black and
white TV and settles on a local news broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … the hunt continues for Butch Haynes,
who escaped last night from the maximum security unit over in
Huntsville. Haynes, six-one, 185 pounds, with brown hair is considered
armed and dangerous. He was last seen…</p>
<p><strong>checkout counter</strong>: Paula checks Butch’s items as Lucy
and Phillip emerge from an aisle and drop a pair of jeans and sneakers
onto the counter.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Here’s the clothes, but Buzz has his heart set
on a Halloween costume for next year. It is half off.</p>
<p><strong>mr. willits</strong>: pays more attention to Butch as the
newscast continues.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … Haynes is believed to have an
8-year-old boy with him as hostage.</p>
<p><strong>closeups - butch and willits</strong>: Each checking out the
other.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’ll get it next time. Go get in the car,
son.</p>
<p><strong>84 ext. main street - day 84</strong>: Terrance pulls his
black and white to one end of Main Street and parks it across the
street, blocking it.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Okay, Pete, I’m all set down here.
You?</p>
<p><strong>another cop</strong>: PETE, 40, probably Terrance’s uncle,
slides his black and white to the opposite end of the street and puts it
in park.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Copasetic. Let’s just keep him tied up til’
the state boys get here.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: They’ve got him penned down in Noodle, north
of Abilene.</p>
<p><strong>86 int. friendly’s - at counter - day 86</strong>: Paula bags
the items, including the jeans.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - willits</strong>: staring straight at Butch.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: shakes his head at Willits – “Don’t
even think about it”.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: walks toward the front door but stops short
when he sees, once again, the Halloween display.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: pays Paula, then stuffs a $20 in her
blouse.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You are truly the friendliest clerk I ever
met.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Thank you for shopping Friendly’s!</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. main street - day 87</strong>: Butch exits the store,
spots the blackandwhites, and slides into the middle of a group of
old-timers moving down the sidewalk at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p><strong>88 int. friendly’s - day 88</strong>: Phillip stands at the
costume display, looks around, then grabs a Casper costume carton,
stuffs it under his T-shirt and walks quickly to the door.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. side alley - day 89</strong>: Butch slides away from
the Old Timers and into the Ford.</p>
<p><strong>90b in rear-view mirror 90b</strong>: Pete, his cherry top
spinning, pulls in behind Butch, blocking his entrance to the main
street.</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. side alley - day 91</strong>: Butch throws the Ford
into reverse and steps on the gas. Pete not expecxting this kind of
pace, at least not from the get-go, leaps into his back seat. The Ford
rams into the black and white pushing it backward into a lightpole and a
truck. The TRUCK’S OWNER, carrying mulch from the feed store, watches as
his truck slides toward him.</p>
<p><strong>truck owner</strong>: Dammit, Pete!!!</p>
<p><strong>92 ext. friendly’s - day 92</strong>: Phillip steps out the
door. He spots the crash and watches as… The Ford blasts back into the
alley in a hail of dust.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. ford - day 93</strong>: Butch, driving like a maniac,
turns into the back alley and steps on it. All at once he mashes on the
BRAKES and comes to a SQUEALING stop.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Butch rips the CAR into reverse and
SQUEALS all the way back to the original side alley.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. friendly’s - day 94</strong>: Phillip stands frozen,
scared, not knowing what to do but keeping a look out on the street for
the Ford.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. friendly’s - day 95</strong>: Lucy and Paula peer
from behind the counter at Phillip and the fracas taking place in the
street.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I knew something was wrong from the
get-go.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Look, he left his little boy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And look, the little rascal has… he’s no
better than…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What?!…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He’s got that Casper costume. He stole it!</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. main street - day 96</strong>: The FORD emerges from
the side alley once more and SQUEALS onto Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: can’t believe his eyes…</p>
<p><strong>his pov - ford</strong>: is COMING STRAIGHT FOR him, hell
bent on destruction and picking up speed.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Terrance sticks his black and white
in rapid reverse and backs down the street at 40 mph.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Get the hell outta’ there. We can’t lose both
vehicles!</p>
<p><strong>terrance’s pov - ford</strong>: is GAINING ON him – he can
actually SEE Butch’s grimaced face – when suddenly it goes into a dusty
fishtail, does a 180, and barrels in the OPPOSITE direction.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: antsy as hell, stuck, wondering how this
whole thing is going to play out. He’s suddenly aware of the peering
eyes behind him. Lucy bangs on the glass.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Buzz! You little shit. Shoplifting is a
crime!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Up to you, Buzz…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: He’s frozen for a second, his knees
knocking, teeth chattering, the works. Lucy appears behind him and the
glass door…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’ll never get away with this, little
mister!</p>
<p><strong>96 continued: 96</strong>: Butch pulls his GUN and FIRES once
into the glass door above the clerk’s heads.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. friendly’s - day 97</strong>: The GLASS DOOR and
surrounding WINDOWS SHATTER into a million pieces, sending Lucy, Paula,
makeup, pantyhose, grins and all into a heap on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>98 ext. street - day 98</strong>: The FORD SQUEALS out down
the street. Pete crawls out from behind the seat and ducks again just
as… … the Ford sideswipes the black and white for good measure and
fishtails out of town. Pete crawls over the back seat again as his radio
SQUAWKS…</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Pete?… Pete? You okay?…</p>
<p><strong>99 int. friendly’s - day 99</strong>: Paula emerges from
behind the counter and stares at Lucy, on the ground amidst glass and
mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Say what you want. I’m keepin’ the
twenty.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. rural road - day 100</strong>: Two young, country
boys stand by the side of the road. One, FRANK, tosses an egg from hand
to hand while he watches the horizon. The other, BILLY, approaches,
crawling through a barb wire fence dragging something behind him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hurry up. Someone’s comin’.</p>
<p><strong>on horizon</strong>: Sure enough, a hail of dust signals the
approach of a vehicle a mile or so away. Billy crawls into the ditch
next to Frank. We see what he’s dragged from the field – a scarecrow
with a floppy hat and red bandana.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stick it in the road. Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We got seven eggs. I get four to throw and
you get three… since it was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here they come. Aim for windows and get ready
to run.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>101 int. ford - day 101</strong>: The car is parked in a
field of some sort. Butch reaches in the back seat for the bag of
clothing.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Here, take them nasty skivvies off and put on
yer’ jeans.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Whatya’ got there?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: A ghost suit.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: From the store? You kyped it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You ain’t mad?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Let’s unnerstan’ each other here.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Stealin’s wrong, ok? But if there’s somethin’
you need bad and you ain’t got the money, then it’s okay to take a
loaner on the item. It’s what ya’ call an exception to the rule.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What? You don’t wanna’ get undressed, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You embarrassed caus’ I might see yer’
pecker?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s… puny.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s puny.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well hell, lemme’ see.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Go on. I’ll shoot ya’ straight.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hell no, Phillip, it’s good size for a boy
yer’ age!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>102 ext. rural road - day 102</strong>: The four Highway
Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at 90+, sending stray dogs and
roadrunners scurrying for cover. CRANE DOWN to reveal the Ford off the
same roadside, but behind a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars
pass, Butch STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off in the
opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. airstream - day 103</strong>: Sally, deep in her
files. She looks up from the file to…</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Bobby Lee who sits by himself,
whittling away at a stick and leering at her. Adler is at the map,
holding the shortwave mike and wearing the earphones. Behind him, Red
stares out the window.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes
for the boy.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: One puzzler though. They say the boy could
have gotten away but didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Probably scared to death.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: That’s not all. The kid stole a Halloween
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Holy Jeezus, they’re a team.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he’s
headed for the Panhandle.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: There’s more roads than people in the
Panhandle.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: How’s that happen?</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Poor counties. They tend to half finish
roads then start on another one.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: But if anybody knows them backroads it’s
Red.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Okay, so… I’m Robert Haynes. Called Butch by
everyone. I was born in Amarillo, but grew up in the French Quarter of
New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What’s she doin’, Red?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I killed a man when I was eight.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How’d ya’ kill him?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Shot him with a pistol. There was always one
around the dance hall. That’s what they called it but it was a
whorehouse. We lived there.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What’d the authorities do?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The victim was wanted by the locals so the
whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: They didn’t even stick him in juvy?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Put me in school. Three years behind but I
catch up.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Sounds like things are goin’ okay’ now?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: They were. For awhile. When I’m twelve mom
dies.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the
bathroom of the brothel. Could have saved herself the trouble.
Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Where’s yer’ father?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched when I
was six. He was a small-time felon. Popped up again after Mom died –
he’d just been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo. A year later I’m in
trouble again.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Yeah? Kill somebody else?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I just
couldn’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: Hell, that’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Judge gave me four years in Gatesville,
toughest juvy farm in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: That’s where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be
a criminal. Seen that before, ain’t we, Red?</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: So, Butch, why don’t you tell us where
yer’ goin’, save us the trouble o’ huntin’ you down?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Where I’m going isn’t as important as ‘Why am
I going there?’</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Shit. ‘Caus’ I’m runnin’ and they’re
chasin’ and I’d jus’ as soon go north as south as east as west. It’s a
fun lil’ parlor game, lady, but right now Butch Haynes don’t have the
slightest idea where he’s headed!</p>
<p><strong>104a int. ford - day 104a</strong>: Phillip, now
fully-attired in his Casper outfit and mask, is looking at a folded map
while Butch drives.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: An inch is 24 miles. Hold yer’ pointin’
finger along the line of the road. You got three lines on your finger,
don’tcha’? Each one’s an inch. So how many inches to Childress?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: One, two… six.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yer’ a helluva’ navigator, Phillip. A lot
smarter than Jerry. But I guess that’s not sayin’ a lot.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Lookie there!</p>

TOWARD them on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. airstream - day 105</strong>: Bradley, driving,
tinkers with a broken windowshade. Suttle yawns, comes to, notices the
broken windowshade and gives Bradley a look. Bradley, caught, just
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Seen one of them in a magazine. It’s called a
motor home. They’re new. Kinda’ like a house on wheels.</p>
<p><strong>107 int. truck - day 107</strong>: Bradley smiles, looks to
Suttle, who nods an “okay.” Johnson sits on the HORN for TWO solid

waves.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. truck - day 109</strong>: Bradley and Suttle wave
back.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: staring out the window. She looks at the
passing Ford.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: Butch is hard to make out, but there’s no
mistaking the Casper outfit Phillip wears with pride.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You said the boy stole a Halloween costume…
What character?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: I believe it was Casper… Casper the friendly
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That was them. They just passed us.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Turn this thing around!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Turn it around! That was them!</p>
<p><strong>110 ext. road - same time 110</strong>: The Airstream slows
to a grind, pulls off the narrow shoulder and begins to make a wide
U-turn.</p>

rear-view mirror and gets a puzzled look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>111b int. truck - day 111b</strong>: Bradley presses the

at the speedometer.</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: It’s… it’s not safe to go over 65 with this
much load!</p>
<p><strong>111c int. airstream - day 111c</strong>: The whole thing is
shaking, twisting, bumping. All aboard try and keep their balance.</p>

to enter the field, misses the flat spot, hits a burm with its front
right tire and flies into the air.</p>
<p><strong>111j continued: 111j</strong>: The trailer hitch snaps as
does the safety chain. The truck lands hard and continues pell-mell
through the field. The AIRSTREAM, sans truck, BLASTS forward along the
road at 50+ m.p.h.</p>
<p><strong>111k int. airstream - day 111k</strong>: Bouncing like hell.
Sally holds on for dear life, then glances out the window and almost
jumps out of her seat when she sees…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Shit!!!!</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Red spots the same but before he can
cuss…</p>
<p><strong>111l ext. road - day 111l</strong>: The Airstream veers off
the road and into the rocky field. Trees, scrub brush and boulders are
no deterrent for the sleek silverfish which seems to be moving even
faster than before.</p>
<p><strong>111m int. truck - day 111m</strong>: Steam, smoke pouring
from the engine. Suttle, covering his eyes, sneaks a peek behind and

around.</p>
<p><strong>111p ext. field - day 111p</strong>: The Airstream, now
losing a bit of steam, hits a burm, almost topples and comes to a
precarious stop in a dried-up watering hole.</p>
<p><strong>111q int. airstream - day 111q</strong>: Adler, still wearing
the headphones, rises first and goes to the radio to answer an incoming
call. Red groans. Sally crawls to her feet and offers Red a helping
hand, which he accepts.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Uh… Red?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: They wanna know if the boy looked okay?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He was laughing and waving.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Don’t tell ’em that.</p>
<p><strong>112 int. governor’s office - day 112</strong>: A large group
of very serious advisors sit and stand in a circle around the Governor’s
desk. Across from GOVERNOR CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS
PERRY. An AIDE on the telephone, turns to the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: They say the boy looked A-okay.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: He’ll be fine, Mrs. Perry. This whole
nightmare will be over and done with very soon and you’ll be home with
your boy. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I want you to know that I personally
okayed the use of a brand-new high-tech mobile home from which to
conduct the manhunt. It’s an amazingly futuristic piece of law
enforcement equipment.</p>

<p><strong>115b int. airstream - day 115b</strong>: Sally, her hair a

distance.</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. road - closeup - butch - day 116</strong>: Staring
at the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Butch sits on the hood of the Ford,
which is stopped on an asphalt road which, a few feet farther, turns
into dirt and a few feet farther a dirt clod field.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Started this road 20 years ago and it still
ain’t finished. Appears to me we got a decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s up to you, Phillip. We can backtrack to
the highway or we can try it on foot.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Where we goin’?</p>
<p><strong>insert - card</strong>: It’s at least 20 years old, crumpled.
It unfolds to reveal a beautiful green valley with a snow capped
mountain behind it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s Alaska, Phillip. Last of the wild
frontier.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You been there?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Naw. Just got the one postcard. But anyhoo,
back to our present dilemma. You feel like a hike?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Can’t be more’n, oh, say, fifteen hundred
miles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yer’ prolly’ right. Go give our supplies a

flat, dusty, barren. A mile or so away sits a home – a small
ranchhouse.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Phillip returns with the bag and
pores through it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: How’s it look?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: A soda… some gum… half a Moon Pie.</p>

chain?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Red walks slowly toward the slumping
Airstream. A PHONE RINGS from inside, then STOPS. Adler sticks his head
out of the door and calls to Red…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Governor’s hot line, Red. Governor insists
that he have the mobile home back for the parade tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell ’em to come and get it.</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. dusty field - day 123</strong>: Butch continues his
hell-bent brisk pace in the field of dirt clods. It’s all Phillip can do
to keep up.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Where we goin’?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’re goin’ trick r’ treatin’, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: We ain’t allowed to trick r’ treat.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: My mama don’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Trick r’ treatin’? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Against our religion.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Against yer’ religion. What kind of
foolishness is that?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Jehovah Witness.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now, I’m askin’ you, Phillip. I ain’t askin’
yer’ mother and I ain’t askin’ Jehovah. Do you wanna’ go trick r’
treatin’ or not?</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. yard of farmhouse 124</strong>: Butch and Phillip
cross the dirt yard and make their way to the door.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Ok, Phillip, all ya’ gotta’ do is knock on
the door and when they open it you say ‘trick or treat.’ Got it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now wait til’ they come.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Trick r’ treat.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well ain’t you the cutest lil’ ghost I ever
did see.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Say it again, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Trick r’ treat, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, seein’ that Halloween was yesterday, I
guess you’ll have to trick me. You missed the caramel popcorn balls I
made up special.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Wait right here.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - telephone wire</strong>: which enters the house
near the door. We PAN WITH the telephone line FROM the house TO a nearby
pole.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: The Woman returns with an armload of
anything she could find in the kitchen. Phillip gratefully opens his
sack and watches as the Woman drops in a loaf of bread, a jar of
mustard, candies, jams, butter and anything else she could find.
Empty-handed she reaches inside the door, opens her purse and dumps her
money – a couple of dollars and lots of change into the bag.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Thankyew.</p>
<p><strong>125 ext. yard - day 125</strong>: Phillip, sack in hand,
waves goodbye to the frightened old Woman, who shuts her door and locks
it. Butch and Phillip make their way back across the yard.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Never underestimate the kindness of the
common man, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Spur 208 northbound. And 83 at Aspermont

<p><strong>127 int. ford - later - day 127</strong>: Butch drives while
Phillip digs through the sack and comes up with a jar of mustard.</p>

<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well, I bet you can make us some mustard
sandwiches, can’t ya’?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeahsir.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well go to it.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Many as you want.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: Mesmerized by the family.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: Ditto. He pulls his eyes back to
the road, notices something.</p>
<p><strong>128 ext. road - day 128</strong>: Butch brings the car to a
stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the
first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala
running.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Be right back. Don’t be stingy with that
mustard now.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the
tallest hill in the county. He takes in the 360 degree view. His eyes
settle on…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: spreading even more mustard. Every so often
he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family.</p>
<p><strong>emergency brake</strong>: slips a little, then gives all at
once.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: starts to roll backwards.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Whooaaa! Butch! Butch!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Step on the brake! Put your foot on the
brake! The middle one!!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: panicked, slides over and grabs the wheel.
Of course, he is too short to press on the brake and when he bends
down…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: swerves off the road and onto the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>family</strong>: headed by BOB, 35, their Ward Cleaverish
father, looks up to see…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: barrelling backwards toward them, swerving to
and fro and followed by Butch shouting instructions.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Everybody, run! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>bob’s wife</strong>: Forget the car, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you crazy. It’s only got a 1000 miles on
it!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: gains control of the wheel and steers the
rapidly reversing Ford around the Wagon.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: continues backwards to the bottom of the hill,
but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline
of the previous hill.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is
near heart attack himself.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Bad brakes.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That was close.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob Fielder.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Edgar Poe.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: breathes a sigh of relief as the Ford loses
momentum and comes to a stop. But then, of course, …</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: like any car on a roller coaster, starts to
move downhill, slowly at first, but then picking up speed.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Had me scared silly. I’ve only had her two
months.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: She’s a beaut, all right. Say, Bob, what with
my brake problem and all, I sure would appreciate a lift. Me’n my boy
live about five miles up the road here. I can pick up the car
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: coming straight for them, gaining speed, with
Casper the friendly ghost behind the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>butch and bob</strong>: chuck the small. Bob looks for a
place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: Screaming at the top of his
lungs.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: Staring straight ahead at Phillip.
Butch doesn’t even flinch, standing his ground in the middle of the
road, staring straight into Phillip’s oncoming face.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: The brake, Phillip! Step on the brake!
Hard!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: totally freaked, jumps down on the
floorboard and pushes with both hands on the brake. SQUEALING TIRES
bring…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: to a SKIDDING halt inches from Butch’s
kneecaps.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: smiles at Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Helluva job, Phillip! Never had a doubt.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: Smiling back.</p>

wagon and smiles a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. roadblock - day 129</strong>: Two Highway Patrol

<p><strong>130 int. station wagon - day 130</strong>: It’s full to the
brim with the Family Bob plus two, Butch and Phillip, who ride in the
back with Bob’s son. As the car approaches the roadblock Butch grabs a
blanket, reclines, and hides behind a stuffed animal.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry for the inconvenience, Edgar. The kids
like the back down like that so they can play.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No trouble at all, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>131 ext. roadblock - day 131</strong>: Bob brings his
precious car to a gingerly stop. He pulls out his license, shows it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why the roadblock, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Escaped convict, sir. Just a
precaution.</p>
<p><strong>132 ext. airstream - day 132</strong>: Bradley examines the
gooseneck hitch. Bobby Lee sits on a nearby rock, still whittling at his
stick. It’s starting to resemble something.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. airstream - day 133</strong>: As in the old
Westerns, it’s quiet, too quiet. The inside of the RV is pretty much
trashed now – the product of men working in close contact. Sally stares
at a file. The silence is broken as Red spits tobacco juice into an
empty Coke bottle. Sally peruses a file.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Sally finds something very
interesting. She looks up at Red. He returns her stare.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>134 ext. airstream - day 134</strong>: Bobby Lee finishes his
whittling, blows away shavings, smiles at his creation, sets it on the
rock, gets up and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. airstream - day 135</strong>: Adler is getting
something on the shortwave.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: They’ve got two Highway Patrol cars they can
give to us now.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell ’em stand by. We got the best seat in the
house right here. Have the southern roadblocks call in the dogs and move
north. Check every road, every farm from San Angelo to Sweetwater.</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: Adler surveys the map and sticks
in a few more thumbtacks.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: He knows he’s hemmed in. I predict we’ll have
him singing a different tune by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. highway - day 136</strong>: The red station wagon
creeps along the highway to the whistled strains of “Old MacDonald had a
Farm.”</p>
<p><strong>137 int. station wagon - day 137</strong>: Butch, truly
“singing a different tune,” whistles “Old MacDonald.” Bob joins in and
soon the whole damn Family Bob is whistling the tune. Bob’s daughter
PATSY, 5, red hair, freckles, starts jumping up and down on the back
seat, singing and spilling her drink.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s son</strong>: You’re spilling! You’re spilling!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Patsy! Look at what you’re doing?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ahhh noooo!</p>
<p><strong>bob’s wife</strong>: Look at what you did! It’s all over the
seat of your father’s new car!</p>
<p><strong>bob’s wife</strong>: What is wrong with you?! I told you
twice not to jump up and down! Didn’t I!!</p>
<p><strong>bob’s wife</strong>: Damn that kid!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s okay, sweetie. Daddy’s not mad.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s wife</strong>: So much for the new car smell.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: This will do fine right here, Bob. But I do
have one more favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>138 ext. road - day 138</strong>: The entire Family Bob is
standing along the roadside, their luggage and belongings by their side.
The looks on their faces say it all – Stranded. Butch hands over the
stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr. on the head and sticks out his
hand to Bob.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry. You’ll get
her back.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Please, it’s new. Hold it under 45… at least
for the next 500 miles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You know I will, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. station wagon - day 139</strong>: Butch STARTS the
CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Wave, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: They look funny.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Maybe, but Bob did the right thing. What if
he’d put up a fight? I mighta’ had to shoot him, and where would that
family be then? Naw, Bob’s a fine family man and that’s about the best
thing a fella’ can hope to be.</p>
<p><strong>140 ext. roadblock - day 140</strong>: The Highway Patrol
continues to monitor cars one by one. One of the Officers sees something
and nudges his partner to look at…</p>
<p><strong>family bob</strong>: cresting the hill carrying their hats in
their hands along with their luggage and coolers.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. airstream - day 141</strong>: Adler drops his
headphones and turns to Red.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: He got through! At Aspermont.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Coerced a motorist.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well goddam, shout at Amarillo. Tell ’em we got
a notion he’s headed their way.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Truth is I wish he’d cross the border so we
could turn this over to the feds.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I got work to do back home.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m hungry. This thing got any food?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Well, uh…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Got T-bones in the frig, Red!</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Uh, uh, those were stocked for the Governor.
I don’t think that he would approve of…</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: – And look, Red! Tater Tots! Those kind you
like!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That so?</p>
<p><strong>142 int. station wagon - day 142</strong>: Butch fiddles with
the RADIO. He settles on a Spanish station playing a BALLAD and ADJUSTS
the VOLUME.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Can’t find a Coonass Waltz to save my ass.
Hey, Phillip, that stuff you told me ‘bout not trick r’ treatin’ causa’
Jehovah… Was you pullin’ my leg?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Nawsir.</p>

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Not even one.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Cotton candy?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Seen that once. It’s red.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Pink.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Never ate none though.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Roller coasters?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Seen pictures.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You know, Phillip, you have a goddammed red,
white and blue American right to eat cotton candy and ride roller
coasters.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>mouth - day</strong>: screaming. PULL BACK to reveal…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: still screaming in glee, the wind
blowing his crew-cut straight up into the air. PULL BACK FARTHER to
reveal that Phillip is firmly tied to the luggage rack of the station
wagon, which is rocketing across the winding plains of West Texas. BOOM
DOWN to reveal Butch, having almost as much fun as Phillip, hooping and
hollering as he steps on the gas and weaves to and fro trying his
damndest to hit every bump.</p>
<p><strong>144 ext. plains of west texas - long shot - dusk
144</strong>: A Nehi Orange sun pours itself into the Grape-Ade Davis
Mountains. PAN ALONG the horizon PAST nothing but open spaces … Then a
red neon sign, small and broken down, like the spit grill diner it
advertises. The stolen station wagon sits alone beside the pressed dirt
parking lot of Dottie’s Cafe.</p>
<p><strong>145 int. dottie’s cafe - dusk 145</strong>: A skinny, small
town WAITRESS checks her face in a bathroom mirror. She applies too much
lipstick and pinches her cheeks before exiting. We FOLLOW as she exits
the kitchen bathroom door, grabs two already prepared hamburger platter
specials from beside the grill and moves through a swinging door into
the diner. A counter, three booths, grease everywhere… She sets the two
plates in front of Butch and Phillip at a booth. Butch digs in but
Phillip holds for a beat. Butch notices and stops chewing while Phillip
says “grace”.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Thankyew, Father, for yer’ ‘boundiful’
nature and goodness.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Amen. Now dig in, Buzz. Call him that caus’
he eats like a buzzard. If it’s dead he’ll swoop and chow.</p>
<p><strong>145 continued: 145</strong>: She leans down to the table and
flirts with her overdone eyes.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You Dottie?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Eileen. Dottie died. Her son runs the
place but… he ain’t never here.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: He leaves at four. Not much traffic after
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: If you need me, I’ll be right over here.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Eat yer’ food.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: sitting outside, rises and slides into
the Airstream while</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Red continues to cook with Adler and
Bradley looking on.</p>
<p><strong>147 int. airstream - backroom - dusk 147</strong>: Sally
turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the mirror. She splashes a
little water on her face and is startled when … Bobby Lee slides in
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Think yer’ pretty smart now
don’tcha’?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Well yer’ not smart but you are
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Work and pleasure should naturally go
together don’t you think? Take me, I enjoy my work.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I could give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: You got a mouth, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How you take your steak, Sally?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Uh.. rare.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: A woman after my own heart.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’ll just wipe its ass, herd it through and you
can cut off a hunk. How’d that be?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Maybe medium-rare.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t give a damn who you work for. You’re
here for one reason and one reason only.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Anything else, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. Yer’ in my office.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: That’s the Governor’s line, Red!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nuthin’ as impolite as callin’ at the dinner
hour.</p>
<p><strong>148 int. dottie’s cafe - night 148</strong>: Phillip, at the
booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from
Butch’s barely touched one. The boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a
peek at Butch, who sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>at counter</strong>: Butch leans over and whispers something
sexy into Eileen’s ear. She giggles and licks her lips. Butch feels eyes
on his back and looks at Phillip, who immediately turns away from them.
When Butch returns his attention to Eileen she’s moved a few feet away
and is refilling ketchup bottles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No thankyew.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Very polite.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I try hard but, ya’ know, since his mama
died…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: – My mama’s not dead!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking
lot and chunk some rocks or something.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Phillip reluctantly slides down off
the stool and slowly walks out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and
Eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: So is she dead or not?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well his biological mother is alive. Gave him
up for adoption to me and my wife. My dead wife, that is. She is, was
Phil, er Buzz’s stepmother, so she’s his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but…
she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>149 ext. parking lot - night 149</strong>: Phillip tosses a
rock then turns to the diner. They’re gone. Phillip drops his handful of
rocks and walks to the front window of the diner.</p>
<p><strong>phillip’s pov - diner</strong>: It is empty. He sees that the
kitchen swinging door is still swinging on its hinges.</p>
<p><strong>150 int. diner - adjunct office - night 150</strong>: A one
room addition office built onto the kitchen. It has a desk against one
wall, a few chairs, a fan – pretty sparse. Two large windows throw light
from the outside neon sign onto the room. A large lamp provides harsh
light. Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door
behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch lifts her up
onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck. Then, in an instant,
he flips her over, pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of
her waitress outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and
suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her
voluptuous backside.</p>
<p><strong>151a ext. diner - night 151a</strong>: Phillip, a bit scared,
moves around the side of the front of the diner and sees something.</p>
<p><strong>151b phillip’s pov - through window 151b</strong>: In profile
Butch continues to kiss Eileen’s buttocks. She moans in ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>151c back to scene 151c</strong>: Phillip, like a pacifist at
a prizefight, doesn’t want to watch but can’t not watch. He moves down
the wall to a window positioned right at the desk. When he stops he’s
right in front of the window, separated from Butch and Eileen by only a
foot of air and a thin plate of glass.</p>
<p><strong>151d phillip’s pov - butch and eileen 151d</strong>: Kissing,
writhing, but FROM this ANGLE all he can really see is a mane of hair
swinging to and fro. Butch is out of sight but it’s obvious that his
lips continue to caress Eileen’s backside. She cranes her neck, arching
it like a swan, moaning like a wildebeast and then… She stops and stares
STRAIGHT AHEAD. Butch continues to kiss but only for a beat, sensing the
locomotive he’s on has stopped at an unscheduled station. He slides his
face from around her rear, a la Kilroy, and he stares, too. Except for
their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art statues
staring STRAIGHT AHEAD AT…</p>
<p><strong>152b butch and eileen 152b</strong>: hold their pose for a
second until…</p>
<p><strong>152c phillip 152c</strong>: comes back to real time and bolts
away into the darkness of the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Nosy little feller’.</p>
<p><strong>152d butch 152d</strong>: races to the side window and
watches as Phillip runs into the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip!…</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: I keep a cot in the back.</p>
<p>****: Nothing but stars swimming in black West Texas crude.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: stands right next to the SPUTTERING NEON
SIGN, staring straight up, the neon light splashing his face in a
grotesque pink light.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: In the b.g., over his shoulder, the
cafe door opens, CLANGING a string of BELLS as Butch hastily exits and
walks past Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>154 int. station wagon - night 154</strong>: Silence. Butch
drives away libidinous desires, Phillip sits quietly, staring straight
ahead, now and again stealing a peek at Butch.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You kissed her, huh?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Jus’ barely.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Caus’ it feels good. Ain’t you ever seen your
mama kiss a man?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: No. You kissed her backside, huh?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s, well, uh, it’s kinda’ hard to explain.
I know how it musta’ looked. Hell, I don’t know how it looked….</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: The lady that cooked the hamburgers?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yeah, Phillip, I love her. Kissed her butt
didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>155 ext. country road - night 155</strong>: The station wagon
pulls off the main dirt road and onto a smaller, private road. After 150
yards or so, it leaves the graded dirt and, shocks bouncing, crosses
into a plowed field and comes to a dusty stop.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You wanna’ drive?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Jus’ kiddin’, Buzz. I’m just gonna’ stop here
for awhile and catch 40.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Things go our way we’ll be in Alaska in four
or five days. Get the jump on winter.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I wanna’ go home.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If you wanted to go home so bad, why didn’t
you stay at that store today?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Caus’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Caus’ why?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: ‘Caus’ I stole. They’d put me in jail.
Prolly’ go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Same difference. We’ll get you home soon. I
swear, okay?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Butch?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yeah, Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I can drive.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Done proved that ain’tcha’? There’s lots and
lots of stuff you can do, Phillip. Reach in that glovebox there. See if
Bob’s got a notepad or something.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Good old Bob. Can you write?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I can print.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Good enough. Now I want you to make a list of
everything you ever wanted to do but wasn’t allowed to. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Like… cotton candy.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Cotton candy?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hell I don’t know. It’s yer’ list.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Butch?…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yeah?…</p>
<p><strong>157 ext. field - night 157</strong>: Only the dome light and
the LOW MUSIC bring attention to the car sitting lonely in the middle of
the massive field.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: How ya’ spell ‘rocketship?’</p>
<p><strong>158 int. airstream - night 158</strong>: The aftermath of a
full scale Texas Bar-B-Q: plates full of gristle and bone, cigarettes
burning in ashtrays and swirl- ing in half-drunk bottles of Coke and
mugs of coffee, men groaning and picking their teeth with toothpicks.
Bradley, Adler and Suttle are dead-ass asleep and snoring. Bobby Lee,
too mean to sleep, sits by himself cleaning his fingernails with a
pocket knife.</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. field - night 159</strong>: Red leans against the
Airstream and sips coffee from his thermos. Sally walks up, sipping from
a mug, and leans against the bumper. Red doesn’t even turn.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Figger to give ’em another hour of shuteye,
then grab the patrol cars and head for the Panhandle.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Bring back any memories?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Too many.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They got a file on me, too?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s the 60’s, Red. They’ve got a file on
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Just caus’ it’s written down don’t make it
true.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You worked as County Sheriff in Amarillo and
Austin before you became a Ranger. Right so far? Oh, and it says your
name’s Cecil.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s definitely the worst of
it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Strong… but good. So Cecil…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Red. What do you do when you’re not at
work.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The file don’t tell ya’ that, too?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I got a ranch I never visit, nieces I hardly
know, a tackle box full of dry lures and a dog that figures he’s the
owner and I’m the pet. Could have a point, he’s there more.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: A confirmed bachelor. Any regrets?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Liked to have wet those lures. Maybe a new dog.
How’d you get into… whatever the hell it is you do?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: My father’s defense lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That explains your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Instead of Home Ec, I studied Criminology.
When I graduated, my father, with the Governor’s help, they, he and my
dad… I created a position for myself with the prison system.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What’s yer’ husband think about all this?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t own one.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yer’ not careful you’ll wind up jus’ like me.
Old, tired, with nobody around to love ya’.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s crazy ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Goin’ without sleep chasin’ after a three time
loser and Casper the Friendly Ghost?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Sleep? That’s what retirement’s for.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bite your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You wanna’ know what’s really crazy? Hayne’s
juvenile court record lists you as Amicus Curiae.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Friend of the court. Evidence given by a
non-party with the intention of swaying the judge one way or the other.
They’re usually in written form, but there’s no copy attached.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Okay, then at least tell me why Haynes got
four years for a joyride? What about probation? The boy had a home, a
father.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What’s your file say about him?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That he was a petty thief who did a little
time, got out and stayed pretty clean.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: There are murderers I’d trust with my mother
and petty thieves I wouldn’t turn my back on. Your precious files are
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hayne’s old man was a career criminal with a
soft spot for whores. One way or the other he beat the hell outta’ every
person he ever crossed, screwed or fathered. Judge sends junior home
with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year
he’ll have a rap sheet as long as yer arm. I know kids who did
Gatesville, made it through, shaped up. Hell, one’s even a priest.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Still, I don’t understand from the file
why…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: – This job ain’t about files and books and
second guessin’. Ya get one shot and ya call ’em like you see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m a bit confused…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: In Texas the bottom line is who ya’ know and
what they owe ya. That’s how I do my job and how you got yours.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I bought the judge a T-bone and told him to
send the boy up. Told him it was the right thing to do. He went along
right down the line.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. station wagon - closeup - memo pad - night
160</strong>: resting on Phillip’s lap.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: His fingers release it as he drifts
to sleep.</p>

lies on the</p>
<p><strong>162 brilliant white light 162</strong>: that FILLS the
FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>extreme closeup - butch</strong>: who exits his dream and
enters reality with a throttled shock. He squints and tries to discern
the source of the light while groping for his gun under the seat.</p>
<p><strong>butch’s pov - white light</strong>: It’s bright as hell but
getting clearer, less fuzzy. We can now see it’s the headlights of a
huge COMBINE which sits, ENGINE RUNNING, directly in front of the
station wagon.</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: A BLACK MAN - 50 or so, KILLS
the ENGINE steps down from the combine cab and starts toward the station
wagon.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Phillip, now wide awake and scared.
He notices that… Butch is fingering the gun, resting it in his hands and
under his right leg. The Black Man, whose name is Mack, crosses the
front of the wagon and walks to the driver’s side window.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: Didn’t mean to scare ya’. I work at night.
It’s cooler. Ya’lls car break down?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Me n’ the boy was just catchin’ some shut-eye
in yer’ field.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: Oh, it ain’t mine. I just works it for
Mr. Andrews. Where ya’ll from?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Drove from Texarkana yesterday.</p>

<p><strong>butch</strong>: Said a mouthful there.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: Well, ain’t no sense in ya’ll sleepin’ in the
car. Not when I got a fold out couch sittin’ empty.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Wouldn’t want to put you out. ’Sides we need

<p><strong>mack</strong>: No trouble t’all. Wake you up first light,
fill yer’ belly and send you on yer’ way.</p>
<p><strong>163 ext. rural road - first light - day 163</strong>: A
Highway Patrol car, followed by a tow truck, breeze along the
highway.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. highway patrol car - day 165</strong>: Two officers,
MONTGOMERY and HALL, scan the horizon. They look like they’ve driven all
night. Saunders wakes up in the back seat and leans forward.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: We didn’t pass it did we?</p>
<p><strong>montgomery</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>167 int. patrol car - day 167</strong>: Hall and Montgomery
view the beat to hell RV while Saunders, ready to cry, jumps out and
runs into the field.</p>
<p><strong>montgomery</strong>: Good Gawd Almighty. Governor ain’t
gonna’ like this.</p>
<p><strong>168 int. airstream - day 168</strong>: Suttle is asleep among
the rubble. He jumps to when Saunders bursts in. Saunders gasps when he
sees the shape his prize vehicle is in.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Uh, uh, they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: How long?!</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: I don’t know, uh, four, five hours.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Well, goddammit, did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: Well, uh, Chief Garnett wanted me to tell
you that the vehicle gets his seal of approval….</p>
<p><strong>suttle</strong>: And that he wants his chair back.</p>
<p><strong>169 ext. airstream - day 169</strong>: We hear a SCREAM and
then a second later, Red’s desk chair comes flying out the door. It hits
a rock and splits as it bounces.</p>
<p><strong>170 ext. highway - day 170</strong>: Two Highway Patrol cars
rocket along, one behind the other.</p>
<p><strong>171 int. lead patrol car - day 171</strong>: OFFICER JONES, a
lean, hard-nose of 25, drives. Adler in the front seat, Red and Sally in
the back. Not a word is spoken. Serious business.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. second patrol car - day 172</strong>: ANOTHER
OFFICER drives this car. Kaiser rides shotgun working the radio. In the
back seat sit Bobby Lee and Bradley.</p>
<p><strong>173 int. mack’s house - day 173</strong>: A COFFEEPOT RATTLES
on the stove. Two black hands move the pot and rescue overfried eggs in
a skillet on the stove. Two small black feet dangle from a too-high
bathroom toilet. As they hit the ground we hear a FLUSH. We FOLLOW the
feet DOWN down a short hall and into the living room. As they pass the
bottom of a fold-out couch we… BOOM UP to reveal Butch and Phillip
asleep. Butch’s arm has found its way under Phillip’s head and is acting
as an early morning pillow.</p>
<p><strong>173 continued: 173</strong>: A small head pops up on the side
of the bed nearest Phillip. The six-year-old eyes of CLEVELAND peer
close to Phillip and watch, only inches away, as Phillip sleeps.
Phillip’s eyes blink a bit and then they open…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Aaaayyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>cleve</strong>: Aaaayyyy!!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Aaaayyyyy!!!!</p>

<p><strong>red</strong>: Let’s head on over towards Amarillo. We’ll
cross him there or wave goodbye at the border.</p>
<p><strong>176 int. mack’s house - living room - day 176</strong>:
Phillip sits on the couch and watches as Butch shows Cleve a trick.
Cleve bends over, puts his hands between his legs and Butch grabs them
and pulls – a flip. Cleve is ecstatic at the result. Phillip and Butch
laugh along.</p>
<p><strong>cleve</strong>: Agin’! Do it agin’!</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Where’s the boy’s mother?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We left her at home this time. Boy’s night

maiden name was Bougeois – half-Creole herself she is, but Mr. Andrews
he don’t like nobody to know. ’Suppose that’s why he give ’em to us.</p>
<p><strong>177 int. bathroom - day 177</strong>: Mack drops his pants
and sits on the throne. He reaches over and turns ON the RADIO resting
on the wash basin. A FARM REPORT comes on just as…</p>
<p><strong>178 int. living room - day 178</strong>: A NEEDLE DROPS on a
78, filling the room with the SCRATCHY sounds of a Coonass waltz.
Butch’s eyes come to life.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You dance, Lottie?</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Lawd goodness no.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Here, jus’ follow me.</p>

Phillip…</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: What’s Texarkana like? I ain’t never been
there.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Oh, it’s real nice. I got a dog named…
Phillip and a tree house and…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Come on, Buzz. Time for us to hit the
road.</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Whass’ wrong, Mack? You look like you seen a
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>cleve</strong>: Do me agin’!</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: No! Boy! Get over by yer’ Mammaw!</p>
<p><strong>cleve</strong>: Come on, Mister, do me agin’!</p>
<p><strong>180 continued: 180</strong>: Butch smiles and starts to
oblige the boy, but Mack inter- venes and smacks Cleve hard, sending him
sprawling to the floor bawling. Butch, instantly enraged, back-hands
Mack, grabs him by the collar and tosses him onto the floor. Phillip –
frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad to worse. Cleve –
confused, bawling, afraid. Butch pulls the gun from his pants, bends
down, picks up Mack by his throat, presses the gun in his mouth and
lifts him into a chair beside Lottie. He bends close to Mack – their
noses are inches apart.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Why’d ya’ wanna’ go and hit Cleve for? He
didn’t move fast enough for ya’, is that it? Or maybe he gets excited
sometimes and don’t hear everything ya’ say? You make me sick to my
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Point it at ’em.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t wanna’…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Point it!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now, son, you wanna’ flip?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Go ahead. Put yer’ hands between yer’ legs. I
won’t hurt ya’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: He don’t trust ya’ no more. You gotta’ earn
that, ya’ know? Put yer’ hands ‘tween yer’ legs, son.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Buzz. Go out to the car and get that
rope.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip!…</p>
<p><strong>extreme closeup - phillip</strong>: His eyes lock in a gaze
with…</p>
<p><strong>extreme closeup - cleve</strong>: His sobbing eyes plead for
something, anything.</p>
<p><strong>181 ext. house - day 181</strong>: Phillip exits the house,
walks past an old well to the station wagon. He opens the door, stops,
looks back.</p>
<p><strong>182 int. house - day 182</strong>: Butch sits on the coffee
table across from Mack, Lottie and Cleve.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now you hold that boy and tell him you love
him.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No, old man. Say it like you mean it.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: This boy know I loves him, mistah’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Then say it.</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Please, mistah’. I gotta’ sense about you. I
know you a good man.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Nome’, I ain’t a good man. Ain’t the worst
neither, jus’ a different breed.</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. house - day 183</strong>: Phillip is at the screen
door looking in. He holds the bag in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Butch sits on the coffee table, which is
pushed right up to Mack, Lottie and Cleve, who sit on chairs.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Say it, Mack. Don’t cost nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: I love you, Cleve.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Gawd that’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>184 continued: 184</strong>: Phillip stands, stares, aware
that something bad is happening. Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife
in his pocket and walks over to the PHONOGRAPH. He turns it back ON. The
SCRATCHY RECORD plays. He turns UP the VOLUME.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You can go wait in the car or you can watch.
Yer’ old enough to think for yer’self.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Shut yer’ eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and Lottie
hold the boy tight. Shut yer’ eyes, too.</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Please, mistah’, ain’t no use in it.</p>
<p><strong>mack</strong>: We’ll give you ever’thing we got!</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Our Father, which are in heaven, Hallo be
thy name…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Shhh… shhh… shhh…</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: … Thy Kingdom come, Lawd, thy will be done…
here on Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Shhh.. shhh…</p>
<p><strong>lottie</strong>: Say it wif’ me….</p>
<p><strong>mack, cleve &amp; lottie</strong>: Giv’ us this day our daily
bread and forgiv’ us, Lawd, our trespasses as we forgiv’ those who
tresspass agin’ us…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: His expression is blank – then a
slight smile. For a second it’s as if none of this has happened, that
Butch will grasp Phillip in his arms… A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his
expression to blank. Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver’s
kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf. The MAMBO RECORD comes
to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD</p>
<p><strong>infinitum.</strong>: Butch falls back to his knees, still
staring at Phillip. He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red
gushes through his T-shirt, and back to the boy.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip?….</p>
<p><strong>184 continued: 184</strong>: Phillip, momentarily dazed,
stares at the gun in his hand, at Butch, the blood pouring from Butch’s
side, and the shocked faces of Mack and his family. Then, in a flash, he
runs, pell-mell, out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>185 ext. house - day 185</strong>: Phillip blasts out the
screen door and runs straight to the well. He drops the gun into the
well, catches his breath and heads for the road. After a few yards he
has a thought, runs back to the station wagon, grabs the keys and throws
them as far into the adjacent field as he can. Then he resumes his race
for the road.</p>
<p><strong>186 int. house - day 186</strong>: Butch gropes to his feet,
still in shock. He stumbles toward the door, then stops, reaches in his
pocket, extracts Mack’s Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward them,
staring hard. Mack, Cleve, Lottie – Afraid they’ll be killed after all.
Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the coffee table…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Thanks for yer’ hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip?!…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: runs down the road, looking back every so
often to see if Butch is following</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: makes his way onto the private dirt and
starts walking back toward the main road.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Phillip?!! I won’t hurt ya’, I swear!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: is running out of steam on the road ahead.
He stops for a blow and looks back.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Phillip crawls through the ditch
beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence. His costume
hangs on a barb. He rips away from the fence leaving a foot-long strand
behind. In the b.g. – a pickup truck drives by.</p>
<p><strong>188 int. truck - day 188</strong>: ARCH ANDREWS, 50, the
owner of the Ranch, slows down when he sees…</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: What the hell?…</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Arch continues on down the road and
passes… Butch – nearly in shock, stumbling down the road.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: pulls into Mack’s place, and Arch gets out,
peers into the station wagon, sees blood, grimaces and walks up to the
house. He notices a dripping trail of blood on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>189 int. house - day 189</strong>: Arch enters the kitchen,
sees no one and starts toward the living room. The MAMBO continues to
SCRATCH.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: Mack?… Lottie?…</p>
<p><strong>190 ext. road - day 190</strong>: Butch, holding his side,
the pain is worse as he stumbles along. He stops when he spots something
– a piece of white costume on the fence. He crosses the ditch, steps
through the fence and walks in the same direction Phillip did.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: That was a helluva’ thing to do, Phillip.
You’re a hero. Prolly’ be in all the papers tomorrow, how you saved
those folks. Truth is, I don’t think I woulda’ killed ’em. I only killed
two people in my whole life. One hurt my mama and one hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>191 int. lead patrol car - day 191</strong>: Adler listens in
on the shortwave.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: A town called Happy, over in Swisher
County.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Half-hour tops.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Get on the radio and tell whoever gets there
first to play it nice and easy.</p>
<p><strong>kaiser</strong>: They’ve got the boy’s mother flyin’ in on a
private. You want her on standby?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jeezus, who did that?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Guvner, I assume.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Not a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Go ahead and chopper her in.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I didn’t mean to pry last night.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yes, ya did.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Look, Red, it was 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Funny thing. When the judge sent him away the
kid stared at me. Like he knew. Not hard or mad like you’d expect. It
was… It was like he was forgiving me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Forgiving you for what?! For looking at the
facts and doing what you thought was right?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Naw. For what’s gonna happen today.</p>
<p><strong>192 ext. field - day 192</strong>: Butch follows Phillip’s
path through the field.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What say we talk this over? Settle things man
to man. Then we can be on our way. I’ll even let you drive. Knock that
right off yer’ list. How’d that be?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: finally arrives at the creek, looking over
his shoulder all the way. He looks at the water – deep and running
swift. Where to go? He decides and heads for the nearest tree – a big
oak, and shimmies up to a branch ten feet or so above the ground.</p>
<p><strong>193 int./ext. local black and white - day 193</strong>: A
country cop answering the report, drives slowly down the road, his
pistol drawn and held upright in one hand. He pulls into Mack’s driveway
and parks. Arch walks out of the house to greet him.</p>
<p><strong>arch</strong>: That’s his car. Took off on foot. He’s got a
pistol. Mack says it looks like a .38.</p>
<p><strong>194 ext. field - day 194</strong>: Butch stops to rest.
Something catches his eye.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Butch walks underneath the tree
without even looking at Phillip. He sits down to rest.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Alaska, Phillip. Wild and wooley. Man against
nature. Me personally, I like them odds. Did I tell you my daddy lives
there? He’s the one that sent the picture postcard. Listen here to what
he says about it…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: ‘Dear Robert’… that’s my real name, Phillip.
Robert. Jus’ like old Bob the family man. ‘Dear Robert, I just wanted to
tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you.’</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: ’Alaska is a beautiful place. Colder than
hell most all the time.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Someday you can come and visit and we’ll
maybe get to know each other better.’ Short and sweet. That’s the old
man’s style. ‘Cold all the time’ – like that’s a big sellin’ point.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: He useta’ pat me on the head and tell folks
‘that it’s some that can live life without askin’ about it and it’s
others has to know why, and this boy here is one of the latters.’ That’s
why I wanted to go up there. To visit the old man, I guess. Prolly’
punch him one first, but then maybe we’d end up bein’ friends, sit down,
have a beer, talk things over….</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’ll jus’ rest awhile. Then you can make up
yer’ mind. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>195 ext. mack’s house - day 195</strong>: A dozen Highway
Patrol cars now sit in the driveway. The Fed in charge, AGENT HENDRICKS,
assigns different officers to secure the area in an incredibly organized
fashion. Mack, Lottie, Cleve and Arch watch from the porch.</p>
<p><strong>196 ext. creekside - day 196</strong>: Butch’s eyes are
closed. A small puddle of blood drips and becomes a rivulet running down
into the creek. Phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can’t bear
it any longer. He slowly climbs down and drops next to Butch, who opens
his eyes to the boy and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: One thing’s for sure now – I definitely
believe in ghosts. Never been shot before.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I know ya’ are. Truth is, if it had to
happen, I’m glad it was you. As opposed to someone I don’t know, I mean.
All things considered, I feel pretty good, though. Could use a beer,
though.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What’s beer taste like?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oh, it’s about the best thing there is. You’d
better put that on the list.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - two more patrol cars</strong>: lights spinning,
rushing down the road, kicking up dust.</p>
<p><strong>197 int./ext. red’s patrol car - day 197</strong>: Sally
watches Red. When the car comes to a stop, she reaches out and touches
his arm.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I think our chances of this thing ending
peacefully are good.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You better run.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Naw, Phillip, I need me a time machine with a
loud radio to take me where I’m goin’. Walkin’s for squares.</p>
<p><strong>199 ext. mack’s house - day 199</strong>: Red exits his
patrol car, followed by Sally. Agent Hendricks walks up.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Garnett, I’m Tom Hendricks, F.B.I., out
of the Amarillo office. I understand you have one of our men with
you?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. You got the area quadroned off?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Water tight. Like a frog’s pussy. Sorry,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No doubt an observation based on personal
experience.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You got him spotted?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: By the creek, half-mile down the road. I
spaced officers in a circle around them 100 yards or so away.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You got any problem with me handling this
one?</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What say we both handle it?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Let’s head on down there. Bradley, gimme’ a
megaphone.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: One other thing, Chief. Haynes is
wounded. The boy gut-shot him.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yer’ shittin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>200 ext. creekside - day 200</strong>: Phillip scoops a
handful of water and brings it to Butch, who opens his mouth and drinks,
A megaphoned voice interrupts…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Butch, this is Red Garnett of the Texas State
Police.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I know yer’ hurt. We’ve got damn near 100 armed
men here. Take a look around and you’ll see I’m shootin’ ya’
straight.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: All this for me. I’m touched, but I’m afraid
ya’ll gonna’ have to back it up a step or two. I’m headed to Mexico.
Lyin’ to ’em, of course.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hate to tell ya’, Butch, but yer’ headed the
wrong direction. Tell ya’ what. You let the boy go and we’ll talk about
it. Discuss it over a cold beer.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Beer. What’d I tell ya’. Appreciate the
offer, Cap’n, but ya’ know I can’t do that. If you and yer’ pals back
outta’ here, I’ll drop the boy at the border. If you don’t I’ll shoot
him in the head. I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. I don’t even have
a gun. What did ya’ do with the pistola’ anyway?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Threw it in the well.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Good thinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Ya’ think he means it?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Based on what’s happened the past two days I
don’t think he would.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: One thing’s for sure. If he gets outta’ here
with the boy, we’re right back to where we started.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: If he kills the boy he’ll get the
chair.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Shit, he’ll get the chair anyway. He’s killed
two in two days.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We don’t know that he pulled the trigger on
either of the innocent victims.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Well he wasn’t at home in his Strat-O-
Lounger. ’Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: All right, both of you, that’s enough! From the
trail of blood I got a feelin’ it ain’t gonna’ make any difference.
Let’s jus’ concentrate on gettin’ the boy out for now.</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: Where ya’ want me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Can you shoot off a hood?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: That’d be the boy’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bring her on over.</p>
<p><strong>204 ext. creekside - day 204</strong>: Butch and Phillip
watch the helicopter land.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: See, Phillip, dreams do come true. There’s
yer’ rocketship.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Think I’ll get to ride it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Today’s the day.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Butch, we got the boy’s Mama here. She wants to
say something.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What’s wrong, Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: It’s my mama.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now that ya’ got yerself a ghost suit, do ya’
think she’ll let ya’ trick r’ treat?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I got to do one house.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Put yer’ mask back on.</p>
<p><strong>205 ext. roadside - day 205</strong>: Bobby Lee carefully
unsnaps the latches on his leather case and opens it on the hood of the
patrol car.</p>
<p><strong>205 continued: 205</strong>: Inside is… a high-powered
military rifle in three parts. Hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out
a high-powered scope. Bobby Lee holds the lens of the scope to his
mouth, blows a breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean
cloth. He feels eyes and turns to see… Sally, watching him at work.
Bobby Lee smiles at her, cocksure. His dark role in this manhunt is now
perfectly clear. Sally turns her head, disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jus’ push the button and talk normal.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Here, I’ll hold the damn thing. You jus’
talk.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Hullo… Hullo. Please, sir, he’s my only son.
I’ll give you money, whatever I can. Please, I want to take my boy home!
I want to…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yer’ doin’ fine. We’ll get another one.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I think yer’ tobacco spit shorted it out,
Red.</p>
<p><strong>206 ext. creekside - day 206</strong>: Phillip wears the
mask. Butch dusts him off and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You ready to go home?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeahsir.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hey, Cap’n, you got any candy?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: This one’s shot.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Well, find another one!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Candy! Halloween candy! Popcorn balls,
caramel apples, gum, shit like that?!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You find me some candy and I’ll deliver up a
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You heard him.</p>
<p><strong>207 ext. roadside - day 207</strong>: Red nods to Adler who
starts to gather sticks of gum, mints, anything from the surrounding
officers.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Don’t have another megaphone, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You all set?</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: You say when, I’ll say dead.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You got yer’self a deal. Candy’s waitin’.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: One more thing. His old lady has to swear to
take him trick r ‘treatin’ every year.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Gimme’ yer’ list, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Butch?…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Gimme that list.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And she’s gotta promise to take him to the
fair for rollercoasters and cotton candy whenever he wants… or at least
once a year…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I wanna’ go home!…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And when he gets older he gets to drink
beer…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I don’t need beer!…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well it’s on yer’ list. And to go out on
dates with girls! Not on the list, but you’ll thank me later for that
little addition. Done that, got to drive, gonna’ ride that rocketship.
That’s about it. She’s gotta’ promise or I won’t let him go!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I wanna’ go home, Butch. My mama’s not bad!
She gives me those things.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t kid a kidder, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>209 ext. roadside -day 209</strong>: Red, exasperated, he
can’t believe how weird this has gotten.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s a deal!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Make her say it!</p>
<p><strong>210 ext. creekside - day 210</strong>: Phillip is near tears.
He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs him with one
arm, pulls him close and holds him like he’s his own child.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I jus’ wanna’ go home.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Know jus’ how ya’ feel, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Phillip knows those things are against our
beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What kinda’ foolishness is that? She
promises!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Make her say it!</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: I promise!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Can we trust her?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: She’s a real good mama.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: When you get home, hide this. If she’s lyin’
you can buy yer’ own damn beer.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yer’ not bad, are you, Butch?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yeah. Now, Buzz, listen here. I want ya’ to
step out there real slow, keepin’ yer’ paws in the air. Then strut right
over to them cops and yell ‘trick r’ treat.’ Got it?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What are you gonna’ do?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Somethin’ll come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: ‘Bye, Phillip. It’s been one helluva’
ride.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: All right, Cap’n. Make way for Casper the
friendly ghost. The friendliest ghost I know.</p>
<p><strong>213 ext. roadside - day 213</strong>: Adler, looking through
binoculars, can’t help but smile.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Gimme’ them things.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - phillip</strong>: nee Casper, walking in his full
whitehood, arms reaching for the sky.</p>
<p><strong>214 ext. field - day 214</strong>: Phillip reaches level
ground and for the first time sees the full strength of the amassed
police forces – at least 20 cars, swirling lights, guns everywhere,
pointing at him.</p>
<p><strong>215 ext. roadside - day 215</strong>: Red watches.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Come on. Keep walkin’!</p>
<p><strong>his pov - through binocs</strong>: Phillip stops walking and
stands perfectly still.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Red lowers his binocs.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Why the hell’s he stoppin’? Call for yer’ boy
to come!</p>
<p>****: Her commands become more and more shrieking and frantic and
continue throughout, giving rise to even more</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. field - day 216</strong>: Phillip turns back and
sees … Butch – He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it,
but his strength is gone. He collapses. Phillip, standing still, with
his mother’s shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a
second then runs back toward him.</p>
<p><strong>217 ext. roadside - day 217</strong>: Red sighs and lowers
the binocs.</p>
<p><strong>218 ext. creekside - day 218</strong>: Phillip stands before
a struggling Butch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Personally I think we negotiated a pretty
fair deal, but if there’s somethin’ else you want…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Do they want to shoot you?</p>
<p><strong>219 ext. roadside - day 219</strong>: A finger strokes the
trigger of a high-powered rifle. Bobby Lee – Smiling, ready, waiting.
Red shrugs and wipes his brow.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: He thought better of releasin’ the
hostage.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It doesn’t necessarily mean that.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Stay on ready.</p>
<p><strong>220 ext. creekside - day 220</strong>: Phillip holds his hand
out and helps Butch get up. Butch stands, dusts himself off, grabs the
boy’s hand and to- gether they walk toward the field.</p>
<p><strong>221 ext. roadside - day 221</strong>: Red, through the
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I seen it all now.</p>
<p><strong>222 ext. field - day 222</strong>: Butch and Phillip, hand in
hand, walking across the field.</p>
<p><strong>223 ext. roadside - day 223</strong>: Red scratches his
head.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What’s he up to?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hell if I know.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He’s giving himself up.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Keep in mind – he still has the gun.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Butch! Stop and let the boy go! Put yer’ hands
up and let the boy go!!!</p>
<p><strong>224 ext. field - day 224</strong>: With all the yelling, it’s
hard to make out what’s being said. Butch and Phillip continue to walk
and talk.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So I guess that’s it for Alaska, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Stop and put your hands on your head!</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Run, Phillip! Come here, Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Chief, we’ve got an armed killer and an
innocent boy out there.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You clean?</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: As a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Keep him locked down. Don’t squeeze til’ I say
‘when.’</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Where the hell you going?</p>
<p><strong>ext. field - day</strong>: Butch and Phillip continue to
walk, Butch holding Phillip’s hand. When Butch spots Red approaching he
slows and then stops. Red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them.
When he gets within 25 feet he stops.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’m unarmed. Toss your gun on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>225 continued: 225</strong>: Butch smiles.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If I had a pistola I’d be headed the other
direction. My partner here got rid of the evidence. Do I know you,
friend?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No… not really.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hmm. Well, look I wanna’ talk to the boy and
then we’ll take care of bidness. How’s that? Only take a second.</p>
<p><strong>226 new angle 226</strong>: Butch and Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I wanna’ give ya’ somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: He’s stopped.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: He’s gonna make a run for it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Give it a second!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Hold him!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Let the boy go, Butch!</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: If he makes a move…</p>
<p><strong>228 ext. field - day 228</strong>: Butch kneels down beside
Phillip. He reaches slowly, pain- fully for his back pocket.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Mebe’ someday you’ll get to go…</p>
<p><strong>229 ext. roadside - day 229</strong>: Hendricks looks through
the binocs.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: He’s goin’ for his weapon!</p>
<p><strong>in field</strong>: Red squints to make out what Butch’s
reaching for.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Butch smiles as he retrieves the POSTCARD
from his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: A look of concern crosses Red’s
lips…</p>
<p><strong>roadside</strong>: Sally realizes it’s not a gun that Butch
is reaching for.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Noooooo…!!!!</p>
<p><strong>finger on trigger</strong>: squeezes – An EXPLOSION followed
by a RINGING ECHO.</p>
<p><strong>in field</strong>: Butch’s chest explodes when the bullet
hits him. He rocks backwards, still on his knees… and looks at Phillip
in amazement. Phillip screams, grabs Butch and holds him up.</p>
<p><strong>through crosshairs of gun</strong>: Phillip is obscuring a
second shot at Butch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: tastes blood and sighs.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day.</p>
<p><strong>at roadside</strong>: Gladys runs from behind the car,
followed by a host of officers.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Keep everybody back!</p>
<p><strong>bobby lee</strong>: No need to worry. He can’t hurt nobody
now.</p>
<p><strong>in field</strong>: Red stands frozen, staring, in another
world. An OFFICER trots up to Butch and does a careful ground frisk.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No weapon, Chief!</p>
<p><strong>roadside</strong>: Red walks up to Bobby Lee, stops and
stares at the grinning marksman. After a beat, Red turns then nearly
jumps out of shoes with a sudden right cross that floors the younger
man. Red starts to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps in,
grabs Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the older man back.
Shouting, i.e. “Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!” Red settles a bit. Hendricks
turns to Bobby Lee who rises to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and
then to Red who is still breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: What the hell was that all about?!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I didn’t say ‘when.’</p>
<p><strong>229 continued: 229</strong>: Red turns and walks away.
Hendricks throws his hat to the ground, kicks it and follows Red with
his eyes…</p>
<p><strong>hendricks</strong>: Goddammit!!</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: I thought he had a gun, too, Red. There was
just no way of knowin’.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: is helped to his feet by his mother. She
holds him dearly to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his
blood-stained Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume
and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead Phillip off but he
won’t leave until… He pulls the postcard from Butch’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: Staring down at Butch.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: His eyes flutter a bit with
recognition.</p>
<p><strong>at patrol car</strong>: Red leans against the car. After a
few seconds Sally walks up and finds a spot a few feet down from him
where she, too, leans against the car. After a few more seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You did everything you could. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t know nuthin’. Not a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>229 continued: 229</strong>: Red reaches into his pocket,
pulls out his tobacco and stuffs a chunk into his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>in field - closeup - butch</strong>: He licks his lips as the
MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around him. He squints hard and sees:</p>
<p><strong>helicopter</strong>: as it lifts off and speeds away. As it
wipes the sun…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - butch</strong>: A slight smile crosses his dying
face as he squints to see Phillip’s flight.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - phillip</strong>: Nose pressed against the glass
bubble.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: His eyes don’t close, still squinted but
frozen.</p>
<p><strong>closeup - eyes</strong>: We realize now, are lifeless.</p>
<p><strong>buzzard</strong>: continues its flight past the sun.</p>
<p><strong>sun</strong>: flares, SENDING the SCREEN TO:</p>
<p><strong>milky white image</strong>: that opened the film.</p>
