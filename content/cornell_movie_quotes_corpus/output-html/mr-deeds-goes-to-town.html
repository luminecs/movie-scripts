<p><strong>mr deeds goes to town</strong>: Written by Robert previous
hit Riskin</p>
<p><strong>exterior - montage</strong>: 1. Quick shots of a car speeding
around curves in a mountainous region. The car jumps a bridge, hurtles
into space, crashes in a fireball. Followed by newsboys hawking special
editions, people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a
succession of banner headlines:</p>
<p><strong>“disclosure of banker’s will awaited”</strong>: and finally
“SEMPLE HEIR AS YET UNKNOWN”</p>
<p><strong>2. close shot</strong>: of Mac, the editor, at his desk,
barking into the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Say listen, Corny, who do you think you’re
talking to? If the Semple attorneys don’t know who the heir is, who
does?</p>
<p><strong>3. close shot</strong>: Of Cornelius Cobb - a hardened
ex-newspaperman, customarily impatient, grouchy and nervous - victim of
the New York tempo. His friends call him “Corny.”</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re asking the wrong guy, Mac. I’m only a
press agent.</p>
<p><strong>the camera pulls back gradually to reveal</strong>: a plush
law office, leather chairs and shelves of books. Arthur Cedar, attorney,
briskly enters scene and seats himself at his desk. Cedar is in the
neighborhood of fifty - grey-templed - dignified - sharp. Cobb is using
the phone on his desk. Cedar glances at him.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Newspaperman?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Hang up.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Sorry, Mac, I can’t. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I
ain’t the attorney�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Hang up.</p>
<p><strong>the camera pulls back further to reveal</strong>: another
attorney at one end of the desk, reviewing a pile of papers.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Mr. Cedar is, and I haven’t seen him in two
days. Listen, Cedar, we’ve got to do something about the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’m not interested in the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: But it’s a great story. Somewhere in this
country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate
the lucky man. When I do, it’s your job to keep the newspapers away from
him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It’s okay with me as long as my weekly stipend
keeps coming in.</p>
<p><strong>the camera pulls back to a full shot</strong>: as two men
rush in with a flurry of excitement. One of them is Anderson, an
obsequious employee of Cedar’s. With him is another lawyer, one of the
Cedar brothers.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: We located him, Mr. Cedar! We found out
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: Yes, John, we got him.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Here’s the report: Longfellow Deeds,
single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Thank heaven.</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: Better wire him right away, John.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’ll do no such thing. I’m going there
myself. You’re going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Make three reservations on the first train
out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mandrake Falls.</p>
<p><strong>4. medium shot</strong>: It is a pleasantly rural scene -
with just a handful of local characters scattered about. At one end of
the platform - some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces of freight are
being loaded. Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand in front of a welcome sign.
The three obviously are out of their element here - obviously “City
folks.”</p>
<p><strong>cobb’s voice</strong>: Welcome to Mandrake Falls -</p>
<p><strong>5. medium shot</strong>: Cobb and Cedar exchange glances.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Are you sure this is the town he lives
in?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all
right.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, I dropped everything at the office - I
hope it’s not a wild goose chase.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He
lives here all right.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ah! I spy a native. Let’s ask him.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Morning, neighbors. Morning.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s an excellent start. At least we’ve
broken the ice.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the
name of Longfellow Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows
Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes, I�</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Must be a game he’s playing.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We’d like to get in touch with him. It’s very
important.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Deeds! Who do you think I’m talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very
democratic. You won’t have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I guess we’d better try somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No, we won’t! The next time that jumping jack
comes out, I’ll straddle him while you ask him your questions.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Morning, neighbors.</p>
<p>****: Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to head back into the
building.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Remember us? We’re the fellows who were here a
minute ago.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. I never forget a
face.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Listen, Pop, we’ve come all the way from New
York to look up a fellow by the name of Deeds. It’s important - very
important!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You don’t have to get rough, neighbor. All
you got to do is ask.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Then please pretend, for just one fleeting
moment, that I’m asking. Where does he reside?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Longfellow Deeds - where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Oh, that’s what you want! Well, why didn’t
you say so in the first place instead of beating around the bush? Those
other fellows don’t know what they’re talking about. Come on, I’ll take
you there in my car. If they’d only explained to me what they wanted,
there would be no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>8. medium shot</strong>: A little old lady, Mrs. Meredith,
answers a knock at the door. Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand there, with
the old man at their heels. Mrs. Meredith is a sweet, soft-voiced, timid
and fluttery little creature.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Oh, will you come in please,
gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Is Mr. Deeds in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: No - he’s over to the park arranging
for the bazaar, so’s to raise money for the fire engine. Mal, you
shoulda knowed he was in the park.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Knew it all the time. But these men said they
wanted to see the house.</p>
<p><strong>9. group shot</strong>: Cobb glares after him exasperatedly.
Mrs. Meredith turns to Cobb and Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Come in, please. Come in. Can I get
you a cup of tea?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Sit down. Sure I couldn’t get you a
glass of lemonade or something?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: That’s very kind of you. Are you related to
him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: No, I’m his housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, we’d like to find out something about
him. What does he do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: He and Jim Mason own the Tallow
Works. But that’s not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from
his poetry.</p>
<p><strong>10. close shot - the three</strong>: Featuring Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: He writes poetry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Oh, my goodness, yes. Longfellow’s
famous. He writes all those things on postcards. You know, for Christmas
- and Easter - and birthdays. Sit down, please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Here’s one - he got $25 for this
one.</p>
<p><strong>11. closeup - mrs. meredith</strong>: As she reads - with
feeling:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: “When you’ve nowhere to turn - and
you’re filled with doubt -</p>
<p><strong>12. closeup - cobb</strong>: His eyes open unbelievingly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith’s voice</strong>: Isn’t it a lovely
sentiment?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Here he is now.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I suggest you break it to him gently. He’s
liable to keel over from the shock.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: They’ve been waiting a long
while.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Longfellow Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’m John Cedar - of the New York firm of
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.</p>
<p><strong>13. close shot - group</strong>: Featuring Cobb. He watches
Longfellow who is glancing at the card.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You gentlemen make yourselves
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>cobb and anderson</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>14. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow crosses to his tuba near
a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks
for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use ’em for bean
shooters.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: You gentlemen going to stay for
lunch?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and
Mary Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Are your parents living?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Why, no.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple
mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Not much. He’s an uncle of mine, I
think. I never saw him, but my mother’s name was Semple, you know.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor
accident in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He was? Gee, that’s too bad. If there’s
anything I can do to�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple
left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you, Mr. Deeds.
Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of
$20,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>15. closeup - longfellow</strong>: His lips are over the
mouthpiece of the tuba. His only reaction to the startling news is to
lift his eyes in Cedar’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: How about lunch? Are the gentlemen
going to stay - or not?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Of course they’re going to stay. She’s
got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the
top? Sure, they don’t want to go to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Perhaps you didn’t hear what I said,
Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, yes, I heard you all right.
$20,000,000. That’s quite a lot, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, it’ll do in a pinch.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all
that money? I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>18. close shot - cedar and cobb</strong>: Staring,
unbelievingly.</p>
<p><strong>19. full shot</strong>: The three men sit around a table,
having lunch. By Longfellow’s side is, as expected, the tuba.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman
associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Buffer?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Yeah. A glorified doormat.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes. You see, rich people need someone to
keep the crowds away. The world’s full of pests. Then there’s the
newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to
avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Funny, I can’t think of a rhyme for Budington.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Why should you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, whenever I run across a funny
name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’ve got one for Cobb�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: “There once was a man named Cobb,</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Sounds like a two weeks’ notice to me.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ve gotten the ‘sackaroo’ in many ways - but
never in rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, I don’t mean that. I’m sure I’m
going to need your help.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, that’s different if it’s just poetry.</p>
<p><strong>22. wider angle</strong>: As Mrs. Meredith enters with coffee
which she pours.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Who - me? No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: No, he’s too fussy for that. That’s
what’s the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in
Mandrake Falls who’re dying to be married�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Don’t pay any attention to her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: He’s got a lot of foolish notions -
about saving a lady in distress.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now you keep out of this!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I
suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young. Incidentally,
we’d better get started. You’ll have to pack.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: You’re going to New York with us.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: This afternoon - at four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I don’t think we’ve got any
suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: Well, we could borrow a couple from
Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’m kind of nervous. I’ve never been
away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant’s Tomb,
though.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I can understand that. We’ll take a walk
around town, meet you at the train at four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: See you later, kid.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: Good day, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Hear what he said? You know how much
twenty million is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. meredith</strong>: I don’t care how much it is. You sit
right there and eat your lunch. You haven’t touched a thing.</p>
<p><strong>24. long shot</strong>: The whole town is out. The band is
playing “He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” - the crowd sings. It’s a festive
occasion. A large, awkwardly painted sign looms over everyone’s head. It
reads:</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I can’t find him.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: You can’t?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I looked everywhere. I even went to his house.
It’s locked up.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: He probably had a change of heart.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: He wasn’t very anxious to come in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Here comes the train.</p>
<p><strong>26. long shot</strong>: Of train approaching.</p>
<p><strong>27. close shot - cedar and cobb</strong>: The band has
already begun and is now in the midst of “For He’s A Jolly Good
Fellow.”</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That tuba player!</p>
<p><strong>28. medium shot - the band</strong>: With Longfellow, in his
customary position, blowing on his tuba.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 27</strong>: Cedar and Cobb stare,
wide-eyed, as the song is finished.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well, now I’ve seen everything.</p>
<p><strong>29. long shot</strong>: In the b.g. is the train with
Longfellow standing on the observation platform, clutching his tuba. On
either side of him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the crowd yells its
farewell. Several of them stuff baskets of fruit into his hands. The
band plays “Auld Lang Syne.”</p>
<p><strong>30. close shot</strong>: Over Longfellow and Cobb’s
shoulders. As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow smiles wanly and
waves.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim!
Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody! Gosh, I’ve got a lot of friends.</p>
<p><strong>31. full shot</strong>: Longfellow is slumped in his seat,
his legs sprawled out, his eyes ceilingward - in deep thought. Cobb sits
across from him. Cedar enters, hangs up his coat, hat and cane.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Will you have a cigar?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I wouldn’t worry if I were you. Of course, a
large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you’ll have
a good deal of help. So don’t worry. Leave everything to me.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, I wasn’t worried about that.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I was wondering where they’re going to
get another tuba player for the band.</p>
<p><strong>32. long shot</strong>: The 20th Century crossing the Harlem
River.</p>
<p><strong>33. another stock shot</strong>: Of the 20th Century going
under the street level on Park Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>34. close shot of office door</strong>: Upon which we read:
“CEDAR, CEDAR &amp;</p>
<p><strong>budington - entrance.” camera pulls</strong>: BACK to take in
Cedar, who opens the door and walks through.</p>
<p><strong>35. close trucking shot</strong>: With Cedar as he strides
across the room - in business-like fashion. He comes to a door marked
“PRIVATE OFFICES.” He pushes this door opens and disappears.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello, John. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’ve been fishing.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Good morning, Celia.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>36. close trucking shot</strong>: With Cedar - as he passes
through the room - arriving at a door marked “JOHN CEDAR, PRIVATE.” He
goes through the door.</p>
<p><strong>37. full shot</strong>: Cedar breezes in and speaks to a
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Good morning. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Waiting for you in the other office.</p>
<p><strong>38. full shot</strong>: A group of associates sit around in
large leather chairs, as Cedar barges in.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Good morning. Hello, boys.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We’ve got nothing to worry about. He’s as
naive as a child.</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: John�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Close that door. Will you get Mrs. Cedar on
the phone, please?</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: Come on, John. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: The smartest thing I ever did was to make
that trip.</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: John, did you get the - uh�</p>
<p><strong>39. med. shot - group</strong>: Favoring Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: No, Budington, I didn’t get the Power of
Attorney. But don’t worry, I will.</p>
<p><strong>the two brothers</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: He said he guessed he’d give it away.</p>
<p><strong>the two brothers</strong>: Give it away!?</p>
<p><strong>one of the brothers</strong>: Well, John, you had the right
hunch!</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: John, if you don’t mind my saying so - we
can’t afford to�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I know, Budington. We can’t afford to have
the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand
times already.</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: But what if they fall into somebody
else’s hands, why - uh�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, it hasn’t happened yet - has it?</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: But a half million dollars! My goodness,
where are we going to get�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old
man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn’t it? And who got the
Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I’ll get it again! I’ll take
it easy. Those books’ll never leave this office.</p>
<p><strong>40. medium shot</strong>: George Semple, a ne’er-do-well,
prominent for the pouches under his eyes and a perpetual nose-twitch, is
sprawled out in a chair reading a newspaper. A nagging wife walks around
him.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: A yokel! Nothing but a yokel! Your uncle must
have been mad to leave all that money to him! You’re as closely related
to him as he is, and what did you get?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stop yelling. Can I help it if my uncle
didn’t like me?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I told you to be nice to him. Ten years we’ve
been waiting for that old man to kick off. And then we were going to be
on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy Street!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, shut up! It’s too late now, and you’re a
nuisance!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: That’s just what I’m going to be - a nuisance.
I’m going to be a nuisance until I get hold of some of that money!</p>
<p><strong>41. full shot</strong>: The editor stands in front of his
desk. Four of five reporters in front of him - several photographers. In
the b.g., leaning against the wall near the door, apparently
indifferent, is Babe Bennett. The editor, Mac, is haranguing them.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: He’s news! Every time he blows his nose, it’s
news. A corn-fed bohunk like that falling into the Semple fortune is hot
copy . . . But it’s got to be personal. It’s got to have an angle. What
does he think about? How does it feel to be a millionaire! Is he going
to get married! What does he think of New York! Is he smart? Is he dumb?
. . . A million angles!</p>
<p><strong>42. close shot - babe</strong>: She has a string in her hand
which she keeps flicking, trying to get a knot into it - in the manner
of cowboys with a rope. Mac’s voice continues over scene:</p>
<p><strong>43. medium shot</strong>: Of them all, as Mac continues:</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: He’s been here three days, and what have you
numbskulls brought in! Any halfwit novice could have done better!</p>
<p><strong>reporter’s voice</strong>: Yeah, we tried too�</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Am I talking too loud? Or annoying anybody?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You know Corny Cobb. He’s keeping him
under lock and key.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Cobb, Cobb! Never mind about Cobb. Use what
little brains you’ve got! Find out something yourselves, you imbecilic
stupes! Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of
you. Come on, get out!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Huh? I said you had dirty plaster.</p>
<p><strong>44. med. close shot at door</strong>: As Babe is still
flicking her string, trying to get a knot. The reporters file past her
on their way out. Just as the last one is approaching, she succeeds in
doing the trick.</p>
<p><strong>45. medium shot</strong>: As Mac turns to Babe.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You too! Thought I could depend on you, but
you’re getting as bad as the rest of them.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Look, I can do it!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s gotten into you, Babe? I remember the
time when you’d blast this town wide open before you’d let Cobb get away
with a thing like this.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, he’s not getting away with anything.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy,
and you can have�</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Can I have a month’s vacation?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: With pay!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: With pay!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Leave four columns open on the front page
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>47. medium shot</strong>: As Babe crosses to door.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Now you’re talking, Babe. I’ll keep the whole
front page open. What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>48. long shot</strong>: Of a large, imposing-looking
residence.</p>
<p><strong>49. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow stands awkwardly between
two tailors - who chalk and pin a suit on him. After a few seconds of
silence:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s the first time I ever had a suit
made on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: It’s merely a suggestion. I don’t wish to
press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you’ll give me your Power of Attorney
we’ll take care of everything. It’ll save you a lot of petty annoyances.
Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, yes, there’ve been a lot of them
around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians -
moochers - all want something. I haven’t had a minute to myself. Haven’t
seen Grant’s Tomb yet.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, you see, your uncle didn’t bother with
that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the
time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you
also want to handle my investments too?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes. That is to say�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, outside of your regular fee, how
much extra will it cost?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Oh - nothing. No extra charge.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That involves a lot of extra work,
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes, but that’s an added service a firm like
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Budington. Funny, I can’t think of a
rhyme for Budington yet.</p>
<p><strong>50. wider angle</strong>: As a butler stands in the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: The gentlemen from the opera are still
waiting in the board room, sir. They’re getting a trifle impatient,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: They are? I forgot all about them.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of
Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on,
that you’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to
Jim Mason?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn’t send
it. I’ve got it written out, though. Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Fine. Send it right away. I don’t want
him to fire Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, sure. Sure. We don’t want to fire
Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He was the last baby my father
delivered, Arthur was.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I think you ought to give this matter some
thought, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I mean, about the Power of Attorney.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, yes. Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’ll give it a lot of thought. There was
a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my
affairs for nothing too. It puzzles me why these people all want to work
for nothing. It isn’t natural. So I guess I’d better think about it some
more.</p>
<p><strong>51. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow, Cedar and the two
tailors.</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: That’s that.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You go to an awful lot of work to keep a
fellow warm, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: A Mr. Hallor to see you sir.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Did you say Hallor?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, don’t let him in.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Why not? Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: A lawyer representing some woman with a claim
against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, if he has a claim, we’d better see
him. Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: He’s capable of causing you a lot of trouble,
Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: How can he make any trouble for me? I
haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I thought I told you to take up this matter
with me, Hallor.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: I’m a little tired of being pushed around by
you, Mr. Cedar - I don’t care how important you are. Mr. Deeds, I
represent Mrs. Semple.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Mrs. Semple?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Yes. Your uncle’s common-law wife. She has a
legal claim on the estate.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We’ll let the courts decide what her legal
position is.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: You wouldn’t dare go into court with a case
like this - and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you
conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up
the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What kind of wife did you say she
was?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Common-law wife. On top of that, there’s a
child.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: A child? My uncle’s?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s awful. The poor woman should be
taken care of immediately.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: I’m glad to see you’re willing to be
reasonable, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: If she was his wife, she should have all
the money. That’s only fair. I don’t want a penny of it.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Don’t make any rash promises�</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’d better get right down there. That opera
mob is about to break into the Mad Song from “Lucia.”</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, I don’t want to keep them waiting
any longer. They’re important people.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You’ll excuse me, won’t you? I’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>53. med. trucking shot</strong>: As Longfellow and Cobb come
out and start down corridor.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Gee, I’m busy. Did the opera people
always come here for their meetings?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s funny. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Why do mice go where there’s cheese?</p>
<p><strong>54. full shot</strong>: A group of eight
distinguished-looking men sit around a long table, awaiting Longfellow’s
arrival. At the head of the table is a Mr. Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: From what I’m led to believe, the young
man’s quite childish. I don’t think we’ll have any difficulty in getting
him to put up the entire amount. After all, it’s only a matter of
$180,000.</p>
<p><strong>chorus of voices</strong>: A drop in the bucket for him.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: You know, gentlemen, we’re really very
fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music. He plays the
tuba in the town band.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>55. same scene</strong>: With Longfellow and Cobb present.
Longfellow looks around, completely awed.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Now, gentlemen, the first order of business
will be the election of a new Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: As a sentimental gesture toward the best
friend opera ever had, the late Mr. Semple, I think it only fitting that
his nephew, Mr. Longfellow Deeds, should be made our next Chairman. I
therefore nominate him.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Second.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: All those in favor . . .</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Carried. My congratulations, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>56. closer shot</strong>: Featuring Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’m Chairman?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Oh Yes, of course - you’ve just been
elected.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’m Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Happy voyage.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Right here, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>57. wider angle</strong>: As Longfellow is led to the
president’s chair. Douglas sits next to him.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Now, the next order of business is the
reading of the Secretary’s minutes . . .</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Move we dispense with it.</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Second.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: All in favor?</p>
<p><strong>chorus of voices</strong>: Aye!</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I think they can be dispensed with. We’re
ready now for the reading of the Treasurer’s report.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Move we dispense with it.</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Second.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: All in favor?</p>
<p><strong>chorus of voices</strong>: Aye!</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Quite right! Now, gentlemen, the next
business will be�</p>
<p><strong>58. med. close shot</strong>: Featuring Longfellow, as he
interrupts:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Wait a minute. What does the Chairman
do?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Why, the Chairman presides at the
meetings.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s what I thought. If you don’t
mind, I’m rather interested in the Treasurer’s report. I’d like to hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>59. close shot</strong>: Featuring treasurer.</p>
<p><strong>treasurer</strong>: The treasurer reports a deficit of
$180,000 for the current year.</p>
<p><strong>60. close shot - longfellow</strong>: He is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: A deficit! You mean we’ve lost that
much?</p>
<p><strong>61. wider angle</strong>: To include all at table.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not
conducted for profit.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It isn’t? What is it conducted for?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Why, it’s an artistic institution�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: We own an opera house, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: And we give shows?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: We provide opera.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: But you charge. I mean, you sell
tickets?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: And it doesn’t pay?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: That’s impossible. The opera has never
paid.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, then, we must give the wrong kind
of shows.</p>
<p><strong>62. med. close shot</strong>: Featuring Douglas and
Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: The wrong kind! There isn’t any wrong or
right kind. Opera is opera!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I guess it is. But I personally wouldn’t
care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn’t be
common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Well, we were rather expecting it to come
from you.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Me?!</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen, there’s nothing
natural about that .</p>
<p><strong>63. shot of directors</strong>: They all stare at Longfellow.
Over scene comes the low wailing cry of a siren, which increases in
volume as it gets closer to the building.</p>
<p><strong>64. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow jumps up.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Hey, a fire engine!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Gee, that was a pip! We expect we’re
going to have one like that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon � with a
siren, too.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now, where were we?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not
conducted like any ordinary business.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Because it just isn’t a business, that’s
all!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, maybe it isn’t to you, but it
certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000.
If it’s losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you
charge too much. Maybe you’re selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of
things. I don’t know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that
money. And I can’t afford to put it into anything that I don’t look
into. That’s my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and
thank you for making me Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>66. med. shot - different angle</strong>: He exits, followed
by Cobb, whose eyes shriek his admiration. The directors watch them
leave, flabbergasted. Cobb’s head reappears in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Gentlemen, you’ll find the smelling salts in
the medicine chest.</p>
<p><strong>67. med. shot</strong>: As Longfellow enters. Hallor and
Cedar rise.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those
opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: What about it, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Why, I turned them down, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: No, I mean - about my client.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh - we’ll have to do something about
the common wife.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tails tonight, sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What - tails? Why, that’s a monkey suit!
Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in
my life.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: Goodbye, and thank you sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Goodbye. Wants me to wear a monkey
suit.</p>
<p><strong>68. closer shot of group</strong>: As Longfellow starts
getting into the trousers.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Of course, we don’t want to appear greedy,
Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: I say we don’t want to appear greedy.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh. That.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why, I’m assisting you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Get up from there. I don’t want anybody
holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Imagine that - holding the ends of my
pants!</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third
of the estate.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: And don’t ever get down on your knees
again, understand?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Excuse me. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Mrs. Semple is entitled to one-third of the
estate.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: One-third? That’s about $7,000,000 isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Well, we didn’t expect that much. I’m sure I
can get her to settle quietly for one million.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: If there’s any talk of settlement, Hallor,
take it up with me at the office.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: I’ll do no such thing�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s right. Don’t you go to his
office. There’s only one place you’re going, and that’s out the
door.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: You’re making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh no, I’m not. I don’t like your face.
Besides, there’s something fishy about a person who would settle for a
million dollars when they can get seven million. I’m surprised that
Mr. Cedar, who’s supposed to be a smart man, couldn’t see through
that.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: Now wait a minute, buddy�</p>
<p><strong>69. med. shot</strong>: Longfellow crosses to bell cord and
pulls it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: There’s one nice thing about being rich
- you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in,
Mr. Hallor, I’m going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people
don’t know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>hallor</strong>: No use in getting tough. That’ll get you
nowhere, Mr. Deeds. You know, we’ve got letters.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front
door?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>70. close shot at door</strong>: As Hallor gets to it.
Longfellow grabs him by the shirt front and half lifts him off the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: And listen, there isn’t any wife - there
aren’t any letters - and I think you’re a crook. So you better watch
your step.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I can’t hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites
wolf. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Only common sense.</p>
<p><strong>71. med. shot</strong>: Cedar has been most uncomfortable
through the scene, but now suavely assumes an admiring attitude.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I can’t hold out any longer either,
Mr. Deeds. Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You’re not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar.
Not till I find out what’s on your mind. Suppose you get the books
straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be
prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. If it becomes
annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Even his hands are oily.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Well, how about tonight? What would you like
in the way of entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall
and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat
or thin, tough or tender?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Women! Ever heard of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Name your poison and I’ll supply it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Some other time, Cobb. Some other
time.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Okay, you’re the boss. When your blood begins
to boil, yell out. I’ll be seeing you!</p>
<p><strong>73. med. shot</strong>: As Cobb exits. Longfellow turns to
Walter, the valet.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He talks about women as if they were
cattle.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Every man to his taste, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I
hear about my uncle true?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as
twenty in the house at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Twenty! What did he do with them?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That was something I was never able to find
out, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wipe off to:</strong>: ? 369 ?</p>
<p><strong>74. med. shot</strong>: Longfellow, exiting his bedroom,
wearing a coat and hat. He comes to the top of a grand staircase, looks
around slyly and sees that no one is watching. He slides down the
bannister and touches the statue at the bottom for good luck.</p>
<p><strong>first bodyguard</strong>: Hey, you going out?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Why yes. Isn’t that all right?</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: No. Don’t ever want to go out without
telling us.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguards</strong>: We’re your bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your
tail no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I
don’t want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>first bodyguard</strong>: Sorry, mister. Orders is
orders.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: Yes, sir. We gotta get you up in the
morning - and we gotta put you to bed at night.</p>
<p><strong>first bodyguard</strong>: Only it’s all right. No matter what
we see - we don’t see nuttin’, see?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s going to be fun.</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: Some people like it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Uh, will you do something for me before
we go out?</p>
<p><strong>first bodyguard</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: Put that away, slug! At your
service!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I got a trunk in that room. Will you get
it out for me?</p>
<p><strong>2nd bodyguard</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>first bodyguard</strong>: With pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguards</strong>: Hey, hey! We’re your bodyguards. You
can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>75. med. close shot</strong>: Longfellow comes out, glances
over the horizon. The air is filled with a slight drizzle and he sighs
happily.</p>
<p><strong>76. close shot</strong>: Babe and two photographers, Bob and
Frank, are huddled conspiratorially in the back seat of a taxi cab.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: There he is. Yep, that’s him.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s who?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Get the cameras ready and follow me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Never mind. Follow me and grab whatever you
can get.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I suppose it’s going to be the same old
thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I tell you that dame’s nuts.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>77. med. close shot</strong>: Longfellow is exiting front
gate.</p>
<p><strong>78. med. shot</strong>: From his angle. Out of the shadows a
girl comes into view and staggers forward. She reaches a tree and
clutches it weakly. Then her strength failing, she crumples to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>79. med. close shot</strong>: Longfellow’s eyes widen in
apprehension as he starts forward - CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. He reaches the
girl and bending down, lifts her head. We see it is Babe Bennett. Her
eyes are closed, apparently in a dead faint.</p>
<p><strong>- low angle</strong>: Longfellow studies her face for a
moment, then starts to lift her. As he does so, her eyes open and she
looks up at him, feigning bewilderment.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You fainted.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, did I? I’m sorry . . .</p>
<p><strong>81. wider angle</strong>: Longfellow tries to assist her.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No, thank you. I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Look, this is my house. I’d like to�</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, no, really - I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Well, I guess I walked too much. I’ve been
looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Hey, taxi!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, stupe! Follow that cab they just got into,
will you? Hurry up! Step on it!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>84. med. close shot</strong>: A corner table, surrounded by
ferns, at which Longfellow and Babe sit. She’s still eating.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Feel better now?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don’t
know how I can ever thank you.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Tell me more about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Well, I guess I’ve told you almost everything
there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I’m down
here alone trying to make a living. Oh, I’m really just a nobody.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You were a lady in distress, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh - uh - nothing.</p>
<p><strong>85. wider angle</strong>: As a waiter enters the scene and
begins removing dishes.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Waiter! Has anybody come in yet?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Huh? On, no. Nobody important.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Be sure and point ’em out to me, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’m a writer myself, you know.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I write poetry.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You’ve been having quite an exciting time
here, haven’t you? All those meetings and business deals and society
people - haven’t you been having fun?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No. That is, I didn’t� Until I met you.
I like talking to you, though� Imagine my finding you right on my
doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>87. wider angle</strong>: The waiter enters again.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Brookfield just came in.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, the poet? Where?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Over at that big round table. The one that
looks like a poodle.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Look - there’s Brookfield, the poet.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>88. med. shot</strong>: From their angle, to show people at a
table, engaged in conversation.</p>
<p><strong>89. med. close shot</strong>: At Longfellow’s table. He
stares off at them, awed. Babe watches his face.</p>
<p><strong>90. med. shot - author’s table</strong>: A group of five men,
drinking - as the waiter enters.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: Oh, yes. I read about him. He writes
poetry on postcards.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Let’s invite him over. Might get a couple
of laughs. Getting rather dull around here.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: It’s always dull here.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>91. med. shot - round table</strong>: At which they are all
seated now. Babe sits next to Longfellow, who is the center of
attraction. Brookfield is just finishing introductions.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: Henaberry, Mr. Morrow, Bill - this is
Mr. Deeds and his fianc�e from Mandrake Falls.</p>
<p><strong>the group</strong>: How do!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Nice of you to ask us to come and sit
with you. Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Waiter! A little service here.</p>
<p><strong>the group</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: He’s a poet. Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No - I don’t want it, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Why, you must drink! All poets drink!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tell us, Mr. Deeds. How do you go about
writing your poems? We craftsmen are very interested in one another’s
methods.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Yes. Do you have to wait for an
inspiration, or do you just dash it off?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, I don’t know. I�</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance,
just dashes them off.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Yes. That’s what my publishers have been
complaining about.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Your readers don’t complain,
Mr. Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>morrow’s voice</strong>: Oh, thanks. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: How about you, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, I write mine on order. The people
I work for just tell me what they want and then I go to work and write
it.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: Amazing! Why, that’s true genius!</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Yes. Have you any peculiar
characteristics when you are creating?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, I play the tuba.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: I’ve been playing the harmonica for forty
years - didn’t do me a bit of good.</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: You wouldn’t have one in your pocket,
would you, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What? A tuba?</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: No, a postcard - with one of your poems
on it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: You mean to tell me you don’t carry a
pocketful around with you?</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: Too bad! I was hoping you’d autograph
one for me.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: I was too.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Quite right.</p>
<p><strong>95. med. group shot</strong>: As they keep on. Longfellow has
his eyes levelled on each speaker in turn, obviously cognizant of their
ill-concealed jibes.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Wait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr. Deeds
would recite one for us.</p>
<p><strong>the other’s voices</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>brookfield</strong>: That’s a very good idea. Nothing like a
poet reciting his own stuff.</p>
<p><strong>one of the others</strong>: How about a Mother’s Day poem,
Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Exactly! Give us one that wrings the
great American heart.</p>
<p><strong>the group</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I guess I get the idea. I guess I know
why I was invited here. To make fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>several voices</strong>: Oh, come now.</p>
<p><strong>henaberry</strong>: Look, he’s temperamental.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yeah, what if I am? What about it?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s easy to make fun of somebody if you
don’t care how much you hurt ’em.</p>
<p><strong>97. close shot - longfellow</strong>: As he rises,
continuing:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I guess maybe it is comical to write
poems for postcards, but a lot of people think they’re good. Anyway,
it’s the best I can do. So if you’ll excuse me, we’ll be leaving. I
guess I found out that all famous people - aren’t big people . . .</p>
<p><strong>98. med. shot</strong>: The group watches him silently as he
leaves the table accompanied by Babe. For a moment they are nonplussed -
then they break into raucous laughter - all but Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>99. close trucking shot</strong>: With Longfellow and Babe as
they take several steps. Then he abruptly stops.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: There’s just one thing more. If it
weren’t for Miss Dawson being here with me, I’d probably bump your heads
together.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Then I guess maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>100. med. shot at table</strong>: Protectively, Brookfield
and Henaberry rise from their chairs. But they are too late, for
Longfellow clips Brookfield on the chin first with his left fist - and
with his right catches Henaberry on the jaw. The punches are almost
simultaneous. The surprise attack catches the men off-guard and they
fall backward. A waiter rushes forward to escort Longfellow and Babe
out.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Manager!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Eureka!</p>
<p><strong>101. med. shot</strong>: As Morrow catches up to Longfellow
and Babe, who are on their way out. The waiter is shooing people
away.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Step aside, step aside!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel
very put out. Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the
button, but sock it hard.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s all right. I got it off my
chest.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: The difference between them and me is I know
when I’ve been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news-stand and I’ll
eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Oh, what a magnificent deflation of
smugness. Pal, you’ve added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight
left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You’re my guest from now
on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going
out to see the sights.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a
sight lovely to behold, and I’d like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop
aboard my magic carpet� �thanks - and I’ll show you sights that you’ve
never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’d kind of like to see Grant’s Tomb -
and the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>103. close shot - group</strong>: Favoring Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Well, you’ll not only see those, but before
the evening’s half through, you’ll be leaning against the Leaning Tower
of Pisa - you’ll mount Mt. Everest. I’ll show you the Pyramids and all
the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you
like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Binge?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play
saloon with me, and I’ll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and
every half-wit in New York. We’ll go on a twister that’ll make Omar the
soused philosopher of Persia look like an anemic on a goat’s milk
diet.</p>
<p><strong>104. close shot - group</strong>: Featuring Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That ought to be fun.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Fun? Say, listen, I’ll take you on a bender
that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Oh, Tempora! Oh, Moeraes! Oh, Bacchus!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Oh, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I guess if we go with him, we’ll see
things, huh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes, I guess we will.</p>
<p><strong>106. med. shot</strong>: Mac is reading the story, eyes
sparkling. Babe is sprawled in a chair, doing tricks with a coin.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: “‘I play the tuba to help me think.’ This is
one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds - New
York’s new Cinderella Man - who went out last night to prove that his
uncle, the late M.W. Semple - from whom he inherited $20,000,000 - was a
rank amateur in the art of ‘standing the town on its cauliflower ear’ .
. .”</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Cinderella Man! That’s sensational, Babe!
Sensational!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: It took some high-powered acting, believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Did it?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I was the world’s sweetest ingenue.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is he really that big a sap?</p>
<p><strong>107. close shot - the two</strong>: Favoring Babe.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He’s the original. There are no carbon copies
of that one.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that
hick that’ll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb’s
face when he reads this?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: If we could sell tickets, we’d make a
fortune.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How’d you get the picture?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Had the boys follow us.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Marvelous! “At two o’clock this morning,
Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse.
When asked why he was doing it, he replied: ‘I just wanted to see how
many doughnuts this horse would eat before he’d ask for a cup of
coffee.’” Beautiful! What happened after that?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I don’t know. I had to duck to get the story
out. He was so far along he never even missed me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: When’re you going to see him again?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Tonight, maybe. I’ll phone him at noon. Oh, my
lunch hour. I’m a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>108. med. shot - the two</strong>: Favoring Mac.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re a genius, Babe - a genius!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I even moved into Mabel Dawson’s apartment -
in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Good! Good! Stay there. Don’t show your face
down here. I’ll tell everybody you’re on your vacation. They’ll never
know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you
can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We’ll have
the other papers crazy. Babe, I could kiss you!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month’s
vacation - with pay.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: With pay!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’ll get it, Babe. You’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>110. close shot</strong>: Walter leans over the bed
violently, shaking Longfellow, who is lost in drunken sleep.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must
get up. It’s late!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You’re Walter, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I just wanted to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>111. close shot - walter</strong>: He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you’ll permit me to say so, sir, you were
out on quite a bender last night, sir.</p>
<p><strong>112. close shot - longfellow</strong>: Longfellow opens one
eye - and then the other, blinking. As consciousness returns to him, he
glances around the room as if to get his bearings.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Bender? You’re wrong, Walter. We started
out to a binge but we never got to it.</p>
<p><strong>113. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Walter offers him a
drink on a tray.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A Prairie Oyster, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Prairie? Oysters?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir. It makes the head feel
smaller.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson
has called, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: She was a lady in distress. She wouldn’t
let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, I do too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’d better call her up and apologize. I
don’t remember taking her home last night.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’d venture to say, sir, you don’t remember
much of anything that happened last night, sir.</p>
<p><strong>114. close shot - the two</strong>: Favoring Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What do you mean? I remember everything!
Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You have no pants, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You came home last night - without them.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I did what!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: As a matter of fact, you came home without
any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, don’t be silly, Walter. I couldn’t
walk around in the streets without any clothes. I’d be arrested.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s what the two policem�n said, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What two policemen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The ones who brought you home, sir. They
said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets,
shouting: “Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to
nature!”</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow
calls up, tell him I’m not in. He may be a great author, but I think
he’s crazy. The man’s crazy, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>115. reverse angle</strong>: Favoring Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir. By the way, did you�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But how’ll I put on the slipper, sir?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you
ever find what you were looking for, sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Looking for?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You kept searching me last night, sir. Going
through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for
Budington.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Better bring me some coffee, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Very good, sir. Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram
came for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>116. medium shot</strong>: Following Walter’s exit.
Longfellow quickly opens the telegram. His face clouds. At this moment,
Cobb comes bursting into the room - a newspaper in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Did you see all this stuff in the papers?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Arthur wants to quit!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Arthur! Who’s Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He’s the shipping clerk at the Tallow
Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he’ll quit.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this
stuff in the paper? How’d it get in there? What’d you do last night? Who
were you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And what’d you do to those bodyguards? They
quit this morning. Said you locked them up.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, they insisted on following me.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What do you think bodyguards are for?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What do they mean by this - “Cinderella
Man!”</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Are those stories true?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I don’t remember. “Cinderella Man!” What
do they mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: They’d call you anything if you gave them half
a chance. They’ve got you down as a sap.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I think I’ll go down and punch this
editor on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No, you don’t! Get this clear: Socking people
is no solution for anything.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sometimes it’s the only solution.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Not editors. Take my word for it. Not
editors!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: If they’re going to poke fun at me, I’m
going to�</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You’ve got brains,
kid. You’ll get along swell if you’ll only curb your homicidal instincts
- and keep your trap shut. Don’t talk to anybody! These newshounds are
out gunning for you.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: But what about this “Cinderella
Man”?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s my job. I’ll take care of that. I’ll
keep that stuff out of the papers - if you’ll help me. But I can’t do
anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be
careful from now on?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes, I guess I’ll have to.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Thank you. If you feel the building rock,
it’ll be me blasting into this editor.</p>
<p><strong>120. med. shot</strong>: He exits. During the scene Walter
has entered with a tray, which he has adjusted on Longfellow’s knee.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Cobb’s right. I mustn’t talk to
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Who? Miss Dawson?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Fine. I’ll talk to her. Give me the
phone, quick. She’s the only one I’m going to talk to from now on.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s awfully nice of you to show me
around like this.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in
New York, I’d go there every day. I’ll bet you do.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Well, I’d like to - but I have a job to think
of.</p>
<p><strong>122. med. close shot - a taxi</strong>: Directly behind the
bus. A man’s head is stuck out of taxi window. We recognize it as one of
the photographers, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey, flap-ears! You better keep following that
bus!</p>
<p><strong>driver’s voice</strong>: Keep your shirt on!</p>
<p><strong>123. close shot - bob and frank</strong>: Two photographers,
with their equipment. They keep their eyes glued on the bus in front.
They return to their seats.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It don’t look as though we’re gonna get any
pictures tonight.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Babe ought to get him drunk again.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Got any news� I mean, has anything exciting
been happening lately?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sure. I met you.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh. What’s happening about the opera?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, that - well, we had another meeting.
I told them I’d go on being Chairman if� I’m Chairman, you know.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I told ’em I’d play along with them if
they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Gosh, you look pretty tonight.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I
wanted to run it like a grocery store.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What are they going to do?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Do you always wear your hair like
that?</p>
<p><strong>125. wider shot</strong>: At this point, two girls pass by,
chattering. One girl has a paper open.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Isn’t it a scream - “Cinderella Man!”
The dope!</p>
<p><strong>2nd girl</strong>: I’d like to get my hooks into that
guy.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Don’t worry. Somebody’s probably taking
him for plenty.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: If they were men, I’d knock their heads
together.</p>
<p><strong>126. close shot - the two</strong>: Favoring Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Have you seen the papers?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s what I like about you. You think
about a man’s feelings. I’d like to go down to that newspaper and punch
the fellow in the nose that’s writing that stuff�</p>
<p><strong>127. med. close shot - the two</strong>: She looks up,
startled.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: �“Cinderella Man!” I guess pretty soon
everybody will be calling me “Cinderella Man.”</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Would you like to walk the rest of the way?
It’s so nice out.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yeah, let’s.</p>
<p><strong>128. med. close shot</strong>: Favoring the taxi driver.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, wise guys. He’s getting off.</p>
<p><strong>bob and frank</strong>: Hey, come on!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He stands across the street from Grant’s Tomb,
looking solemn. His eyes moist. She is unaware of his emotion.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Come on, don’t you want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Feast your eyes. Grant’s Tomb!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that it? Hey, beetle-puss! The Tomb!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: As they approach the monument.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: There you are. Grant’s Tomb. I hope you’re not
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: To most people, it’s an awful letdown.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I say, to most people it’s a washout.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That depends on what they see.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Now, what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy
becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General
Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a
new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being
inaugurated as President� Things like that can only happen in a country
like America.</p>
<p><strong>133. closeup - babe</strong>: To intercut with above speech.
During his recital, she watches his face, fascinated. Her impulse is to
laugh, but she finds that she can’t.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>134. med. close shot</strong>: A switchboard operator
fielding calls.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Hopper. Mr. Cedar
won’t answer his phone. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>office clerk</strong>: Say, what’s going on in the boss’s
office?</p>
<p><strong>switchboard operator</strong>: Search me. The three ‘Cs’ and
little ‘B’ have been in there for over an hour.</p>
<p><strong>135. full shot</strong>: Cedar paces the floor. His brothers
look worried. Budington is enthroned at Cedar’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: I don’t want to be critical, John, but
here it is�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes, I know. A week’s gone by and we haven’t
got the Power of Attorney yet!</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: Yes, but you said�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I don’t care what I said. I can’t strangle
him, can I!</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: It’s ridiculous for us to have to
worry about a boy like that. Look at these articles about him!
“Cinderella Man!” Why, he’s carrying on like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: Exactly what I was saying to my wife when
this�</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: Who cares what you were saying to
your wife?</p>
<p><strong>136. close shot at desk</strong>: As secretary’s voice comes
over dictograph:</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I can’t help it. Let them wait!</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: Those people have been in to see me
every day this week.</p>
<p><strong>2nd brother</strong>: Who are they ?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Relatives of old man Semple.</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: They keep insisting they should have
some nuisance value.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Nuisance value?</p>
<p><strong>first brother</strong>: They say if it hadn’t been for Deeds,
they’d have gotten all the money.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Nuisance value.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. semple</strong>: We’ve been trying to�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting. How
are you, sir? I don’t know what my secretary could</p>
<p><strong>mr. semple</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: There’s Times Square.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You can almost spit on it, can’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Why don’t you try?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh! It’s breezy up here.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You’re worried about those articles they’re
writing about you, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’m not worrying any more. I suppose
they’ll go on writing them till they get tired. You don’t believe all
that stuff, do you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why
people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don’t
they try liking each other once in a while?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>140. med. trucking shot</strong>: As Babe and Longfellow
walk.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Here’s a nice place.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yeah. Anyway, there aren’t any
photographers around.</p>
<p><strong>141. medium shot</strong>: Bob and Frank, sneaking around in
the bushes.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You know, you said something to me when you
first met me that I’ve thought about a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You said I was a lady in distress.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, that�</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What did you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Nothing�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged
or anything?</p>
<p><strong>143. closeup - babe</strong>: The corners of her mouth go up
in sympathetic amusement.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You don’t go out with girls very much, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>144. close shot - the two</strong>: Favoring Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You must have met a lot of swell society girls
since you’ve been here. Don’t you like them?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I haven’t met anybody here that I like,
particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance. Except you, of
course. People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget
how to live Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and
looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau
said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to
create the noblemen to put in them.</p>
<p><strong>145. reverse angle</strong>: Favoring Babe. She stares at him
curiously.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’d rather have Mandrake Falls.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’m from a small town too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Gosh! What do you know about that!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Ah, it’s a beautiful little town, too. A row
of poplar trees right along Main Street. Always smelled as if it just
had a bath.</p>
<p><strong>146. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Longfellow watches
her face intently.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’ve often thought about going back.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there
when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father.
That’s funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you,
too. Sometimes he’d let me hold the line while he smoked - and we’d just
sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I’d go over and
kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember
him saying: “No matter what happens, honey, don’t complain.”</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He sounds like a person worth while
knowing.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He played in the town band, too.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He did? I play the tuba�</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What did he play?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: The drums. He taught me to play some.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes. I can do “Swanee River.” Would you like
to hear me?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>147. medium shot</strong>: She picks up a couple of branches.
With the two sticks she drums on the bench seat - and sings “Swanee
River.”</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, I suppose you could do better.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sure. I can sing “Humoresque.”</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: “Humoresque”? I’ll bet you don’t even know how
it goes.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and
I’ll do “Humoresque” with you.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: It had better be good.</p>
<p><strong>148. close shot - bob and frank</strong>: They wait with
their camera. When they hear the singing, they look up, and then at each
other in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I wonder if they’d want to make it a
quartet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>149. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow and Babe. They are
having a grand time with their singing. A policeman saunters into the
scene and stands watching them for a few seconds, without their being
conscious of his presence. He smiles, shakes his head and passes on out
of scene. Over the shot we hear the low moan of a siren in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>150. close shot - the two</strong>: They reach the climax of
their song - and laugh joyously. At this moment, the shrieking of the
siren is nearer and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly. Excited, he
jumps up and runs toward street. Babe looks up, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Fire engine! Fire engine! I want to see
how they do it. Wait for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>bushes</strong>: Frank grabs the camera.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Looks like the evening is not going to be
wasted!</p>
<p><strong>152. medium shot</strong>: They dash by the policeman, who
looks up, startled.</p>
<p><strong>153. long shot</strong>: As the fire engine slows down - and
people are beginning to gather. We see Longfellow running toward the
truck and hopping aboard.</p>
<p><strong>154. med. shot at fire truck</strong>: As Longfellow jumps
on.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello - what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Captain Deeds - fire volunteer -
Mandrake Falls.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Hi, Cap! Boys, meet the Captain!</p>
<p><strong>155. long shot - reverse angle</strong>: Bob and Frank
running with their cameras toward Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>156. closeup</strong>: Of typewriter carriage. It contains a
paper upon which the following is typed:</p>
<p><strong>157. full shot</strong>: Several feet away from her Mabel
Dawson stands in front of an easel, working silently on a painting. She
dabs at it and turning, pauses a moment to watch Babe, who at the moment
rests her forehead on the typewriter carriage.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: What’s the matter, hon?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: What’s up, Babe? Something’s eating you.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: My unfailing instinct tells me something’s
gone wrong with the stew.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You haven’t gotten very far, have you? That’s
where you were an hour ago. Come on, let’s knock off and go down to
Joe’s. The gang’s waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I can’t write it, Mabel! I don’t know what’s
the matter with me.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Uh-huh. I think I can tell you.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Hello . . . Yes, she’s here. Who wants her?
Who? Oh, yes. Yes, just a moment. It’s him - whatcha-ma-call-him - the
“Cinderella Man.” The “Cinderella Man”!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>159. close shot - longfellow</strong>: Who lies dressed in
bed, phone in hand.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Couldn’t sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to
you. Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No - not at all. I couldn’t sleep either.</p>
<p><strong>161. close shot - longfellow</strong>: At phone.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I wanted to thank you again for going
out with me. Huh? Well, I don’t know what I’d do without you. You’ve
made up for all the fakes that I’ve met.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Well, that’s very nice. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You know what I’ve been doing since I
got home? Been working on a poem.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’d like to read it some time.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Maybe I’ll have it finished next time I
see you. Will I see you soon? Gosh, that’s swell, Mary. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Mabel, that guy’s either the dumbest, the
stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he’s the grandest
thing alive. I can’t make him out.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’m crucifying him.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: People have been crucified before.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Why? Why do we have to do it?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You started out to be a successful newspaper
woman, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yeah, then what?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Search me. Ask the Gypsies.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Here’s a guy that’s wholesome and fresh. To us
he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he
gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his
arms.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: The guy’s balmy.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to
laugh, but I couldn’t. It stuck in my throat.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Aw, cut it out, will you? You’ll get me
thinking about Charlie again.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He’s got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what
that is?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No - of course you don’t. We’ve forgotten.
We’re too busy being smart-alecks.</p>

<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all
set for the reception.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What do you mean by coming in here when
I’m playing?</p>

<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Get out. The evil finger’s on you. Get
out!</p>

<p><strong>a wife</strong>: Even if he heard you, he wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: I hear he still believes in Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>a woman</strong>: Will he be Santa Claus? That’s what I want
to know.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Have you all got your slippers ready
for the “Cinderella Man”?</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: With $20,000,000, he doesn’t have to
have looks!</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: He won’t have it long with that Pomponi
woman hanging around him.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: My dear, I hear he can’t think unless
he plays his tuba!</p>
<p><strong>168. full shot</strong>: Babe is listlessly packing her few
things in a small handbag. She slowly and meticulously folds a silken
undergarment, wrapping it in tissue. Her eyes have a distant look. Mabel
watches her, concerned. There is a long pause before either of them
speaks.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You’re a fool, Babe.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I just couldn’t stand seeing him again.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Running away is no solution.</p>
<p><strong>169. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Babe is
unresponsive.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: What’ll I tell him if he calls up?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job
in China - some place.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You’re acting like a school girl.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What else can I do? Keeping this up is no
good. He’s bound to find out sometime.</p>
<p><strong>170. medium shot</strong>: Babe, not wishing to explain to
them, hides her bag - and follows Mabel to greet them in the living
room.</p>
<p><strong>171. med. full shot</strong>: The boys cross to a table and
drop their cameras.</p>
<p><strong>bob and frank</strong>: Say, where is everybody? Come on,
Babe - the artillery’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: It’s those two sore spots again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You shoulda been down to the office today,
Babe.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Boy, was he burning.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just one little drink - and then we’re ready
to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Just a minute. No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: We’re not going out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thought you had a date with him.</p>

<p><strong>173. med. close shot</strong>: Frank, Bob and Mabel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Say, what’s the matter with her now !</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You wouldn’t know if I drew you a diagram.
Now, run along and peddle your little tin-types.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What is this? Throwing us out of here’s getting
to be a regular habit.</p>
<p><strong>174. close shot at door</strong>: As Mabel opens the door
slightly. We see Longfellow. Mabel’s eyes open in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is Mary Dawson here? I’m Longfellow

Yes, I’ve been her sister for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is she home?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is Mary home?</p>

<p><strong>180. medium shot</strong>: Mabel and Longfellow still
standing, looking at each other.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Oh, Mary? Yes, of course. Well, I don’t know

<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Why there she is! Of course she’s home.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Hello, Mary. I waited in the park for
you over an hour. I thought maybe you’d forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Mabel in b.g.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I didn’t think you could come with the party
and everything.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t let them stop me from
seeing you. So I threw them out!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You threw them out!</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: You mean� �by the neck or something?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw
’em out.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I guess that’ll be in the papers
tomorrow. It will give ’em something else to laugh at.</p>
<p><strong>183. closeup - babe</strong>: Her face clouds -
miserably.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: I don’t mind though. I had a lot
of fun doing it.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Would you like to go for a walk?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes, if it isn’t too late.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’ll get my hat.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn’t
it? - isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Yes, lovely. We’ve had a lot of nice weather
lately.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It would be a nice night to go for a
walk, don’t you think?</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ow! My foot’s asleep!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Come on - let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: No, you don’t. Just a minute. No more
photographs.</p>
<p><strong>187. close trucking shot</strong>: As they walk slowly down
the front steps.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: The reason why I wanted to take a walk,
Mary, is ’cause I wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Let’s just walk, okay?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>188. close trucking shot</strong>: As they walk along a foggy
street, on their faces.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Mary, I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Are you? When?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: In a day or so, I think.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I don’t blame you.</p>
<p><strong>189. close two shot</strong>: Continuing on them, as they
slowly walk around the block.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: A man ought to know where he fits in. I
just don’t fit in around here. I once had an idea I could do something
with the money, but they kept me so busy here, I haven’t had time to
figure it out. I guess I’ll wait till I get back home.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You
don’t have to pay any attention to me.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No, I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: All my life, I’ve wanted somebody to
talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: A girl?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a
lot through the woods and I’d always take this girl</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, here we are again.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes, here we are again. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>190. close two shot</strong>: Favoring Babe. She cuts him
off, her voice shaking.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Goodbye, darling. Don’t let anybody hurt you
again - ever. They can’t anyway. You’re much too real. You go back to
Mandrake Falls. That’s where you belong - goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>191. wider angle</strong>: She runs up the steps.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Mary�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You know the poem I told you about? It’s
finished.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Would you like to read it? It’s to
you.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: You don’t have to say anything, Mary.
You can tell me tomorrow what you think.</p>
<p><strong>193. closeup - babe</strong>: Reading softly:</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: “I tramped the earth with hopeless beat -
Searching in vain for a glimpse of you. Then heaven thrust you at my

reading:</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: “My dream has been answered, but my life’s

<p><strong>195. closeup - babe</strong>: Her eyes are beset with fears.
She loves him - but knows how hopeless it all is. She slowly starts
freeing herself from his embrace.</p>
<p><strong>196. med. close shot - the two</strong>: As Babe, weeping
softly, frees herself from his embrace.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Hey, what’s the big idea?</p>
<p><strong>197. close shot - mac</strong>: Behind his desk.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Stop it, Babe! Stop it! What do you mean,
you’re quitting! You might as well tell me I’m quitting.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s bothering you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Last night he proposed to me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry
him?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why, Babe - that’s terrific! “Cinderella Man
Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That�”</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Print one line of that, and I’ll blow your
place up!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell
story. I just got carried away. That’s too bad. So he proposed to you,
huh? What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he�</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yeah. Funny twist, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Say, you haven’t gone and fallen for that mug,
have you?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, I’ll be�</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That’s tough, Babe.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’m going to tell him the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Tell him you’re Babe Bennett? Tell him you’ve
been making a stooge out of him?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’m having lunch with him today. He expects an
answer. It’s going to be pretty.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re crazy! You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>199. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Over their
shoulders, from behind, as Mac comforts her.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He’ll probably kick me right down the stairs.
I only hope he does.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ll put you on another job. You need never see
him again, eh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: That’s the rub.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh, as bad as that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Telling him is the long shot - I’m going to
take it.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Well, it was fun while it lasted, Mac. I’ll
clean out my desk.</p>

emerges from his room and slides down the bannister of the grand
staircase.</p>
<p><strong>201. medium shot</strong>: Table is set for two. Two butlers

<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is that the best you’ve got?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Oh, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Those flowers are too high. Won’t be
able to see her. Get a smaller bowl, will you?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: A smaller bowl of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>2nd butler</strong>: Yes, sir. A smaller bowl of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Did you get that stuff I was telling you
about?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Stuff, sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That goo. That stuff that tastes like
soap.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de
fois gras, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yeah, that’s fine. Have a lot of it
because she likes it.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now you got the idea. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Sit over there, will you?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Me sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes. You’re too tall. Slink lower, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: More. Now forward.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: How is this, sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Perfect! Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I wish you luck, sir.</p>

<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Walter! Walter! Walter, where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything
happened3</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Anything happened? I’ve got to get
dressed! I can’t meet her like this!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But she isn’t due for an hour, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: An hour? What’s an hour! You know how
time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right
here, sir. There, sir.</p>
<p><strong>204. medium shot</strong>: At this moment, Cobb bursts in -
his face grim:</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don’t mind
you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Will you tell the gentleman I’m not
in?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That
dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for
years. She’s the slickest, two-timing, double-crossing�</p>
<p><strong>205. closeup - longfellow</strong>: His face goes livid, as
Cobb’s voice continues:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>206. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow has started out toward
him. In two long strides, Longfellow has grabbed Cobb by the
shirt-front, ready to strangle him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: All right. Go ahead. Sock away, and then try
to laugh this off.</p>
<p><strong>207. closeup - longfellow</strong>: As he looks at the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>insert: picture of babe bennett</strong>: Under which is the
following:</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Longfellow stares long and
unbelievingly at the picture.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: She’s the star reporter on The Mail. Every
time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She’s the dame
who slapped that monicker on you - “Cinderella Man.” You’ve been making
love to a double dose of cyanide!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>209. medium shot</strong>: Cobb crosses to phone and picks up
receiver.</p>
<p><strong>210. med. close shot</strong>: Babe is at her desk. She has
just finished rummaging through her desk. Many articles are on top. Mac
is by her side. Babe flicks the pages of a small loose-leaf book, and
hands it to Mac.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: This is for you , Mac. The names of all the
headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from
them at reasonable prices.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Aw, listen Babe, I can’t let you quit now.
You’re not going through with this thing, are you?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve seen ’em get in a rut like you before -
but they always come back.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s for you. In a couple weeks you’ll get the
itch so bad, you’ll be working for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Hello . . .</p>
<p><strong>211. medium shot</strong>: Cobb is at the phone.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Babe Bennett? Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Hello, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, hello darling.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is it you who’s been writing those
articles about me?</p>
<p><strong>214. close shot - babe</strong>: At phone.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Why - uh - I was just leaving - I’ll be up
there in a minute� Look - uh, yes, I did - but I was just coming up to
explain�</p>
<p><strong>babe’s voice</strong>: Oh listen, darling, wait a minute!
Please! Listen�</p>
<p><strong>216. medium shot</strong>: As a butler enters.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I beg pardon, sir. Shall I serve the wine
with the squab, sir?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I beg pardon, sir.</p>
<p><strong>217. closeup - cobb</strong>: His face softens.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: If I knew you were going to take it so hard, I
woulda kept my mouth shut. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>218. medium shot</strong>: As finally Longfellow speaks,
without turning.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Pack my things, Walter. I’m going
home.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>219. wide shot</strong>: Longfellow emerges from his bedroom,
walking briskly toward the staircase, immediately followed by Cobb and
Walter. Walter is loaded down with suitcases. Longfellow is wearing coat
and hat.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: They can have the Estate.</p>
<p><strong>220. medium shot</strong>: Two butlers are struggling with a
wild-eyed man of middle age. They shout in unison.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You can’t come up here!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: There he is! I just wanted to get a look at
him.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: There you are! I just wanted to see what
kind of a man you were!</p>
<p><strong>221. full shot</strong>: Favoring Longfellow, who has reached
the bottom of the staircase and watches the man warily.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I just wanted to see what a man looks like
that can spend thousands of dollars on a party - while people around him
are hungry! The “Cinderella Man,” huh? Did you ever stop to think how
many families could have been fed on the money you pay out to get on the
front pages?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Come on! Take him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Let him alone.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Let me alone! If you know what’s good for
you - you’ll let me get this off my chest!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Shall I call the police, sir?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No! What do you want!!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Yeah - that’s all that’s worrying you. What
do I want? A chance to feed a wife and kids! I’m a farmer. A job! That’s
what I want!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: A farmer, eh! You’re a moocher, that’s
what you are! I wouldn’t believe you or anybody else on a stack of
bibles! You’re a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get
out of here!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Sure - everybody’s a moocher to you. A
mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Stay where you are, young feller. Get over
there.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You’re about to get some more publicity,
Mr. Deeds! You’re about to get on the front page again! See how you’re
going to like it this time! See what good your money’s going to do when
you’re six feet under ground. You never thought of that, did you? No!
All you ever thought of was pinching pennies - you money-grabbing hick!
You never gave a thought to all of those starving people�</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>222. med. shot - the group</strong>: The man slumps into a
chair and the gun drops to the floor. Cobb bends quickly and picks it
up. Longfellow never moves.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I’m glad I didn’t hurt nobody. Excuse
me.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Crazy. You get all kinds of crazy ideas.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Losing your farm after twenty years’ work -
seeing your kids go hungry - a game little wife saying “Everything’s
going to be all right.” Standing there in the bread lines. It killed me
to take a handout. I ain’t used to it. Go ahead and do what you want
with me, mister. I guess I’m at the end of my rope.</p>
<p><strong>223. close shot</strong>: At the table that was all set for
Babe. The man sits, eating. He seriously bends over his food. Longfellow
sits opposite him - his eyes glued on the man, absorbed in profound
thought.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can I take some of this home with me?</p>
<p><strong>“longfellow deeds to give fortune away</strong>: Huge farming
district to be divided into ten acre farms - fully equipped - at a cost

clamor at the gates, being jostled around by the police.</p>
<p><strong>225. full shot</strong>: It has been transformed into an
office. Longfellow sits at one end of the room. Clerks are at several
desks. On one side and leading out into the hall, is a long line of men
waiting to be interviewed.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go on. Step lively.</p>
<p><strong>226. med. shot</strong>: At Longfellow’s desk. He has a two
days’ growth of beard and looks worn. Next to him is a clerk. In front
of him is an applicant.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>applicant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Any children?</p>
<p><strong>applicant</strong>: No, no children.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you’ll
qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.</p>
<p><strong>applicant</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Next, please.</p>
<p><strong>227. med. close shot at desk</strong>: Longfellow, clerk and
applicant.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: How many does that make?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You’ve okayed 819.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s going awfully slow. We need 1100
more. Hello . . . oh, yes. Yes. The water development seems okay - but I
don’t like the road layout yet. Come up tonight about ten and bring the
maps. Right.</p>
<p><strong>228. wider angle</strong>: As the farmer in previous sequence
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Here’s the order for the plows. We got a
good price on them.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s fine. Thanks. I’ll look ’em over
later.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Oh, Mr. Deeds�</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: �my wife wanted me to tell you she�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, thanks, I - uh� How do you do?
What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>rankin</strong>: George Rankin, sir.</p>
<p><strong>229. close shot at a desk</strong>: Cobb is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No! No! We’re not buying any bulls. What’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>230. medium shot</strong>: Cedar behind his desk. In front of
him is Henry Semple and his nagging wife. Cedar shoves a paper in front
of Semple.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We have very little time. He’s ordered me to
turn everything over to him immediately. We have to work fast before he
disposes of every penny.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: See! I told you something could be done. I
knew it all the time. Sign it, dear.</p>
<p><strong>semple</strong>: We may get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Oh, don’t be so squeamish.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: There are millions involved. After all, you
have your legal rights. You’re his only living relatives.</p>
<p><strong>231. close shot at desk</strong>: As Semple picks up the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>semple</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: That’s your agreement with Mr. Cedar, if we
win.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: You see, my end is going to be rather
expensive. I have a lot of important people to take care of. I have the
legal machinery all set and ready to go. I’ve been working on nothing
else for the last week. You say the word, and we’ll stop this yokel dead
in his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Sign it!</p>
<p><strong>semple</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Charlie, we’re off! Papers all set?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Okay, then. Go to it. And, Charlie�</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Find out who wrote those newspaper articles
and subpoena them right away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>232. medium shot</strong>: A large, raw-boned Swede stands
before Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>svenson</strong>: Christian Svenson.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>svenson</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Where is your farm?</p>
<p><strong>svenson</strong>: South Dakota north.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: South Dakota - north?</p>
<p><strong>svenson</strong>: South Dakota - but on the top.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>233. wider angle</strong>: Cobb enters, very
businesslike.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What about your knocking off for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Not hungry. I want to get through this
work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on
those trucks?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Come on, come on. What are you trying to do,
kid? Keel over? You haven’t been out of this house in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>svenson</strong>: Oh, sure, sure. If you like to have a
sandwich, I can give you one, please.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Thanks. Thank you. Never mind, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>234. long shot</strong>: Of the long line of applicants
waiting for an audience.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of
them.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What? There must be 2000 of them out
there.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, that doesn’t make ’em any less
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.</p>
<p><strong>236. full shot</strong>: In front of the line there is a
slight scuffle, as a man is being pushed forward by some others. He
mumbles a protest, tries to get back into position, but the men push him
forward again.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Go on, say something. Say something!</p>
<p><strong>237. closeup - longfellow</strong>: He looks up
inquiringly.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mr. Deeds, the boys here wanted me to say a
little something. They just wanted me to say that� Well, they wanted me
to say that� We think you’re swell - and that’s no baloney.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Say something more!</p>
<p><strong>239. close shot - longfellow</strong>: He smiles
self-consciously.</p>
<p><strong>240. med. close shot of men</strong>: The spokesman
apparently has not finished yet. Directly behind the line, three
officious-looking men have made their appearance and wait for him to
conclude.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Give me a chance, fellas. We’re all down and
out - but when a fellow like you comes along, kinda gives us a little
hope - and they just wanted me to say�</p>
<p><strong>one of the sheriffs</strong>: Break it up.</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>2nd deputy sheriff</strong>: Are you Longfellow Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: Sheriff’s office. We’ve got a
warrant to take you into custody.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: A warrant for your arrest.
You’ll have to come along with us.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What’s up? What do you mugs want?</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: I don’t know nothing, buddy.
All I know is the Sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Insanity! Who’s says he’s insane?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The complainant is a relative of the late
Martin Semple. The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable of
handling the Estate.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, somebody got panic-stricken about his
giving his dough away, eh? Where do you think you’re going to take
him?</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: To the County Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Of course, that’s only temporary. A hearing
will follow immediately.</p>
<p><strong>242. closeup - longfellow</strong>: As he speaks quietly.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s fine. Just because I want to give
this money to people who need it, they think I’m crazy. That’s
marvelous. That makes everything complete.</p>
<p><strong>243. wider angle</strong>: To include group.</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: Let’s get going!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Wait a minute! Not so fast. We’re going to get
a lawyer. I’ll call Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No, don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: As a matter of fact, I’m from Mr. Cedar’s
office. He represents the complainant.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>first deputy sheriff</strong>: Well, let’s go. We’re wasting
a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: All right, I’ll go. But get your hands
off me!</p>
<p><strong>244. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow starts to walk forward,
accompanied by Cobb - and the two deputies and Charlie fall in behind
them.</p>
<p><strong>the sheriffs</strong>: Make way! Make way!</p>
<p><strong>245. close shots of clerks</strong>: To be intercut with
above scene. They stare, petrified, and mumble to each other.</p>
<p><strong>246. medium shot</strong>: Of the farmers and other
applicants. The line has fallen out and they stand in a bunch, staring
pathetically and hopelessly at the departing group.</p>
<p><strong>247. closeup of the farmer</strong>: Who stands in f.g. of
bunch. What is taking place has slowly penetrated his befuddled brain.
The disappointment he feared is here. His body imperceptibly sags, his
eyes dim - all hope having gone out of them.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: INSERT: SIGN reading: “COUNTY HOSPITAL”</p>
<p><strong>248. medium shot</strong>: A guard sits at a desk near a
door, talking on the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, most everybody in town has been here to
see him. Yes, sir. I won’t. Goodbye�</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry, lady� Oh, it’s you again.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, please! I’ve got to see him.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Now listen, sister, for the fourteenth and
last time he don’t want to see nobody.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Will you just give him my name?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Listen, toots, just between us, there ain’t a
thing in the world the matter with that guy till I mention your name,
then he goes haywire!</p>
<p><strong>249. medium shot</strong>: Longfellow is seated by the far
wall, peering moodily out the window. Cobb paces about. Suddenly, he
wheels on Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What are you going to do - just sit back and
let them railroad you? It’s as pretty a frameup as ever hit this rotten
town! If you’d just let me get you a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>250. med. close shot</strong>: As Cobb continues.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You can’t walk into that courtroom without
being ready to protect yourself in the clinches. Cedar’s too smart. With
the array of talent he’s got lined up against you - you’re cooked!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Listen, pal - I know just how you feel. A
blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces. I came out with a sour
puss - but full of fight. Come on, you don’t want to lay down now.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Do you realize what’s happening? They’re
trying to prove that you’re nuts! If they win the case, they’ll shove
you in the bughouse. The moment they accuse you of it, they have you
half licked. You’ve got to fight!</p>
<p><strong>251. med. close shot</strong>: The guard is reading his
paper. Babe is still waiting, pacing.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Go on, sit down, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>252. med. close shot at door</strong>: As Cobb comes out. The
guard gets up to check the door is locked.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: So long, Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Corny!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Corny!</p>
<p><strong>253. close two shot</strong>: Cobb glares at Babe
belligerently.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’ve got to see him! I’ve got to talk to
him!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Haven’t you done enough damage already?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Somebody’s got to help him! He hasn’t got a
chance against Cedar. Look, I’ve been all over town talking to
everybody. I’ve got Mac all lined up - and the paper’s behind him. And I
can get him Livingston, too. With a lawyer like Livingston, he’s got a
fighting chance.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re wasting your time. He doesn’t want any
lawyers. He’s sunk so low, he doesn’t want help from anybody.</p>

<p><strong>261. med. close shot</strong>: From a side door Longfellow
enters, accompanied by his guard. Immediately the place is astir. As he
advances to a chair in front of a table�</p>
<p><strong>262. med. full shot - courtroom</strong>: Necks crane for a
glimpse. Whispered conversations take place.</p>
<p><strong>263. close shot - henry semple</strong>: He looks guilty,
nose twitching more violently than ever.</p>
<p><strong>semple</strong>: Here he is!</p>
<p><strong>264. close shot - babe and mac</strong>: Babe sits up, her
eyes riveted on Longfellow. Impulsively she starts to rise, but Mac puts
a restraining hand on her.</p>
<p><strong>265. med. close shot</strong>: Longfellow turns neither to
left nor right. He is slumped low in his chair, staring solemnly into
space. Cobb breaks into scene and sits down beside him.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Cedar just sent for me. Wants to make a
settlement. Here’s your chance to get out of the whole mess. What do you
say?</p>
<p><strong>266. med. long shot</strong>: The bailiff calls out as the
Judge proceeds to his bench.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Quiet, please! The Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, is now in session, the Honorable
John May, Judge, presiding. Be seated.</p>
<p><strong>267. med. close shot</strong>: To include Judge and
Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The court wishes to warn those present that
it will tolerate no disturbances.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I understand that you have no counsel,
Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no intention of defending any of these
charges. Now, if you wish to change your mind, the hearing can be
postponed.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>268. medium shot</strong>: Cedar is on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: �and in the interests of my client, the only
other living relative of the late Martin W. Semple, we cannot permit a
fortune so huge to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and
abnormality we shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: I have before me a series of articles
written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever
since he came to New York.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: She tells how, in the midst of a normal
conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba. She tells of his
attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason. In
fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which
Mr. Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without
provocation.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I, myself, unable to keep pace with his
mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an
opportunity to represent him as his attorney. This newspaper woman, whom
we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour
feeding doughnuts to a poor horse. And by his own statement, waiting for
that horse to ask for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We have photographs to substantiate this
little episode, and other photographs showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a
fire engine. This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the
disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted. This
writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in
the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she
quite aptly named him “The Cinderella Man.”</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: We have witnesses here from Mandrake
Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his
lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary
one.</p>
<p><strong>272. med. close shot</strong>: Featuring Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: We have others who will tell of his unusual
behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his
home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them. Only recently when he
was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be
examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually
made a violent attack upon them.</p>
<p><strong>273. close shot - the judge</strong>: As Cedar continues
talking, CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDER SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: In these times, with the country
incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent
of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and
impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of
fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover. It
is our duty to stop it! Our government is fully aware of its
difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the
assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any other crackpot.</p>
<p><strong>274. med. panning shot</strong>: Of farmers, the Swede and
others.</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: His attempted action must therefore
be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of
grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public
benefactor.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, at this time, we would like to
call our first witness: Miss Louise - Babe - Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>276. full shot</strong>: There is a mild stir, and all wait
expectantly for Babe to appear.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Miss Bennett, please.</p>
<p><strong>277. closeup - longfellow</strong>: He has his face averted
and doesn’t look at her.</p>
<p><strong>278. medium shot</strong>: Babe continues to rivet her eyes
on Longfellow, as she is sworn in.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Raise your right hand, please.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Do you solemnly swear the testimony you may
give before this court to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: State your right name, please.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Louise Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Take the stand.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Miss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning
Mail?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I must ask you to direct your attention to
me.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Your Honor, this is ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please answer the questions.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: The whole hearing’s ridiculous! That man’s no
more insane than you are.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Bennett please!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: This is outrageous!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: It’s obviously a frameup! They’re trying to
railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Young lady, another outburst like that and I
shall hold you in contempt! We’re not interested in your opinion of the
merits of this case. You’re here to testify. Sit down and answer the
questions. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by
the Morning Mail?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you
again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No! I resigned last week!</p>
<p><strong>281. close shot - longfellow</strong>: As Cedar proceeds
without interruption.</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: Well, prior to that time - were you
employed by the Morning Mail?</p>
<p><strong>babe’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Were you given an assignment to follow the
activities of Longfellow Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Did you subsequently write a series of
articles about him?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Are these the articles?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Were you present when all these things took
place?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Are they true!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: But they did take place?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: They’re colored! Just to make him look
silly!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: And you saw them happen?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes, but I�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: That’s all, Miss Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: It isn’t all! I’d like to explain�</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: That’s all, Miss Bennett. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>283. medium shot</strong>: A bailiff takes Babe by the
arm.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Come on, miss - come on!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, I’d like to submit these articles
as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Let go of me! What kind of hearing is this?
What are you trying to do - persecute the man? He’s not defending
himself. Somebody’s got to do it!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Bennett, please!</p>
<p><strong>284. closer shot</strong>: Featuring Babe and Judge.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I’ve got a right to be heard! I’ve attended
dozens of cases like this. They’re usually conducted without any
formality at all. Anybody can be heard! My opinion is as good as these
quack psychiatrists. I know him better than they do.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Bennett, if you have quite finished, I
should like to inform you that one more utterance from you and I shall
place you under arrest. I’m willing to hear anything anyone has to say -
but I insist on it being done in an orderly fashion. When you have
learned to show some respect for this court, you may return. Until then,
you’d better go back to your seat and calm down.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: This way, miss.</p>
<p><strong>285. wider angle</strong>: As Babe is led away, there is
another courtroom stir.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: Order in the court!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, have you anything to say in
defense of these articles?</p>
<p><strong>287. close shot - judge</strong>: He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds? Mark these Exhibit A for the
plaintiff.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>288. close shot - babe</strong>: As she sits down beside Mac
- who places an affectionate arm around her shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>290. close shot - longfellow</strong>: He looks up, sees the
old ladies and smiles at them friendily.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your
Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have
one of them testify.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes! Yes! Let’s get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: What is your name, please?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jane Falkner. This is my sister, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes - Amy.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: I’ll direct my questions to you, Miss Jane.
You can answer for both. Do you know the defendant, Mr. Longfellow
Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh yes, yes - of course we know him.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: How long have you known him?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Since he was born.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He was a seven-months baby.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Thank you, that’s fine. Do you see him very
often?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Most every day.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sometimes twice.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Must we have the echo?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will
you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow
Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: They think he’s pixilated.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh yes, pixilated.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: He’s what?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: What was that you said he was?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Pixilated.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Now, that’s a rather strange word to use,
Miss Jane. Can you tell the court exactly what it means?</p>
<p><strong>293. close shot - psychiatrists</strong>: As one of them
speaks up.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The
word pixilated is an early American expression - derived from the word
‘pixies,’ meaning elves. They would say, ‘The pixies had got him,’ as we
nowadays would say a man is ‘balmy.’</p>
<p><strong>294. medium shot</strong>: The Judge nods his understanding.
The Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement. Cedar sighs
victoriously.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Now tell me, why does everyone think he’s -
uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar things?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He walks in the rain, without his hat, and
talks to himself.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sometimes he whistles.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: And sings.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Blacked his eye.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: And why?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We
always run into the house when we see him coming.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Never can tell what he’s going to do.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He sure is pixilated.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, yes - he’s pixilated all right.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Thank you, ladies. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>296. close shot in witness stand</strong>: A policeman in
uniform.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: They kept hollering: “Back to Nature!
Back to Nature!” I thought they looked harmless enough so I took them
home. I never thought he was cracked.</p>
<p><strong>297. close shot in witness stand</strong>: The waiter at
“Tullio’s.”</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I’m a waiter. He kept pressing me to point
out the celebrities, and so help me Hannah I’m coming out of the kitchen
a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin’ up the floors with them.
I never figured he was a guy looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>298. close shot in witness stand</strong>: Mme. Pomponi.</p>
<p><strong>mme. pomponi</strong>: He threw us out bodily! But
bodily!</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: We was hired as his bodyguard, see? Well,
the first crack out of the box, he throws us in a room and locks the
door, see? Now, if a thing like that gets around in our profession, we’d
get the bird - see? So I says to my partner, “Let’s quit this guy, he’s
nuts!”</p>
<p><strong>300. close shot in witness stand</strong>: A Cockney
cabman.</p>
<p><strong>cabman</strong>: I’m very fond of Clara, sir. She’s a nice
‘orse. And when this bloke ’ere started feedin’ ‘er doughnuts, I yelled
down to him, “Mind what you’re doin’ down there! Mind what you’re
doing’!” Of course I wouldn’t mind, sir, but Clara won’t eat nothin’ but
doughnuts, now.</p>
<p><strong>301. wide shot</strong>: Of one of the photographers and
enlarged photographs of Longfellow’s antics.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: Come to order.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, I wish to call your attention to
these exhibits. Mr. Davis, do you recognize these reproductions?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure, they’re good enlargements. Where’d you
have them made?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Did you make the originals of them?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sure. I took the originals. Taking pictures is
my business. I photograph a lot of nuts.</p>
<p><strong>wipe off to:</strong>: As Cedar speaks.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: And now, Your Honor, if the court pleases, I
shall call upon Dr. Emil Von Holler, if he will be good enough to give
us his opinion. Dr. Von Holler, as you know, is the eminent Austrian
psychiatrist - probably the greatest authority on the subject in the
world. At present he is in this country on a lecture tour, and has
graciously volunteered his services. Dr. Von Holler?</p>
<p><strong>voice of bailiff</strong>: Dr. Von Holler!</p>
<p><strong>302. wider angle</strong>: As the clerk finishes swearing
Dr. Von Holler in.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are
about to give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? State
your right name, please.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: Emil Von Holler.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Take the stand.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Now Dr. Von Holler, will you kindly tell the
court what your opinion is on this case?</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: This is purely a case of manic
depression. In cases of this kind, patients sometimes go on for years
before being detected.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last
book there are some very fine examples.</p>
<p><strong>dr. fosdick</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: Especially, the one of the young
nobleman, you remember?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fosdick</strong>: Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler.
Very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: It reminds me very much of this one.
Nicht wahr?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fosdick</strong>: Ja.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: It takes so long to detect them�
�because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor,
may I show you? May I use the chart?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: Below here, they are extremely
depressed, melancholy, impossible to live with, and often become
violent. From this mood the manic depressive might gradually change
until they reach this state. Here is lucidity. Here they are perfectly
normal. As normal as you or I� �assuming, of course, that we are
normal.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Dr. Von Holler, how would you say that
applied to Mr. Deeds’s case?</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: The symptoms are obvious. When he was
here, on top of the wave, he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth
toward his fellow-men. He wanted them around him. So he decided he would
give a big reception. But in the meantime, his mood has changed. He is
now at the bottom of the wave - depressed - melancholy. So, when his
guests arrive, he throws them out. They are now his imaginary
enemies.</p>
<p><strong>304. close shot - longfellow</strong>: As Von Holler’s voice
continues:</p>
<p><strong>von holler’s voice</strong>: Other instances of high elation
are when he plays his tuba, when he writes his poetry, when he chases
fire engines in his desire to help humanity. This is contrasted with his
present mood, which is so low that even the instinct for
self-preservation is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>305. med. shot front of courtroom</strong>: Von Holler still
continues:</p>
<p><strong>von holler</strong>: Oh, the man is verrukt. Your Honor, this
is decidedly a case of a manic depressive.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Thank you, Dr. Von Holler.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, we rest.</p>
<p><strong>306. full shot - courtroom</strong>: There is a shifting of
bodies, and a renewed interest, as they wait for the next move. The
Judge and his own two experts go into an inaudible huddle.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Come on, what’re you going to do? Let them get
away with it? They got you cooked.</p>
<p><strong>his exhibits</strong>: Judge comes out of his huddle and
glances at Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, before the court arrives at a
decision, isn’t there anything you wish to say?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Come on - don’t be a sap!</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 308</strong>: The Judge watches him a few
moments, hesitatingly, and then turns to his experts.</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: He’s sunk.</p>
<p><strong>assistants etc.</strong>: They smirk confidently.</p>
<p><strong>312. close shot - babe and mac</strong>: She stares,
panic-stricken.</p>
<p><strong>313. med. shot</strong>: Of the Swede, the farmer, and
others. Their faces show their resentment.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You both concur?</p>
<p><strong>experts</strong>: Oh, positively.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony
and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the
Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed
to an institution as prescribed by law. You need medical attention,
Mr. Deeds.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: No! No! No! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You can’t do it! You’ve got to make him
talk.</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: Your Honor, I object!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, darling, please. I know everything I’ve
done. I know how horrible I’ve been. No matter what happens, if you
never see me again, do this for me.</p>
<p><strong>judge’s voice</strong>: Miss Bennett, please!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: You said I could speak! You said I could have
my say if I were rational. I’m rational. Please, let me take the witness
chair.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He must be made to defend himself before you
arrive at a decision.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Very well. Take the stand.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Oh, thank you!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing
on the case. I object.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Let her speak.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I know why he won’t defend himself! That has a
bearing on the case, hasn’t it? He’s been hurt! He’s been hurt by
everybody’s he met since he came here, principally by me. He’s been the
victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him -
made him a target for their feeble humor.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: I was smarter than the rest of them! I got
closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn’t he keep quiet?
Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound
imbecilic.</p>
<p><strong>318. closeup - babe</strong>: As she continues.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: He can thank me for it! I handed the gang a
grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>319. wider angle</strong>: As Cedar protests.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: But Your Honor - this is preposterous!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Certainly I wrote those articles. I was going
to get a raise - and a month’s vacation! But I stopped writing them when
I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was.</p>
<p><strong>320. close shot - longfellow</strong>: As Babe’s voice
continues:</p>
<p><strong>babe’s voice</strong>: He could never fit in with our
distorted viewpoint because he’s honest and sincere - and good. If that
man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets.</p>
<p><strong>321. med. shot</strong>: Cedar jumps up.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman’s
obviously in love with him.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Well, you are in love with him, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: What’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: You are , aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>322. closeup - longfellow</strong>: To be intercut during her
speech. At first he merely glances up at her speculatively. Finally, he
begins to show some interest.</p>
<p><strong>323. med. shot front of courtroom</strong>: Cedar turns to
the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why
shouldn’t she defend him? It’s a tribute to American womanhood - the
instinct to protect the weak. I’m not saying that nobody likes the boy.
I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn’t mean to
say�</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor,
I’d like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I’m her editor. When she quit
her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe
Bennett says is okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: If you have anything to say, you will take
the stand.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve already said it, Your Honor. I just
thought I’d like to get my two cents in.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t be a sucker, pal. Stand up and speak your
piece.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Your Honor, I’ve got a couple of cents I’d
like to put in�</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’ve been with this man ever since he came to
New York�</p>
<p><strong>324. med. shot</strong>: Shooting toward the Judge. He pounds
his gavel, interrupting Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sit down! There will be no further
interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: How about us, Mr. Deeds!</p>
<p><strong>325. med. shot</strong>: Shooting toward audience. As the
farmer finishes, a dozen others are on their feet.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yes! What about us, Mr. Deeds!</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: Order! Order!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: In the interest of Mr. Deeds, I have
tolerated a great deal of informality. But if there is one more
outburst, I shall have the courtroom cleared.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Your Honor�</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: I’d like to get in my two cents’
worth.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Take the stand!</p>
<p><strong>326. close shot - babe</strong>: Her eyes sparkle
happily.</p>
<p><strong>328. med. shot</strong>: To include Longfellow, Judge, and
others around them. Longfellow hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Well, I don’t know where to begin.
There’s been so many things said about me that</p>
<p><strong>329. close shot at witness stand</strong>: Longfellow
continues:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: About my playing the tuba. Seems like a
lot of fuss has been made about that. If a man’s crazy just ’cause he
plays the tuba, then somebody better look into it, ’cause there are a
lot of tuba players running around loose. Of course, I don’t see any
harm in it. I play mine whenever I want to concentrate. That may sound
funny to some people - but everybody does something silly when they’re
thinking. For instance, the Judge here is an O-filler . . .</p>
<p><strong>330. wider angle</strong>: Front of courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces
in the O’s, with your pencil. I was watching you.</p>
<p><strong>insert: of a printed document</strong>: Of some sort. All the
O’s and P’s and R’s have the white spaces pencilled in.</p>
<p><strong>331. closeup - judge</strong>: As he looks up from the
document. He is a trifle self-conscious. Laughter comes from the
courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: That may make you look a little
crazy, Your Honor, just sitting around filling in O’s - but I don’t see
anything wrong ’cause that helps you to think. Other people are
doodlers.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Doodlers?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s a name we made up back home for
people who make foolish designs on paper when they’re thinking. It’s
called doodling. Almost everybody’s a doodler. Did you ever see a
scratch pad in a telephone booth? People draw the most idiotic pictures
when they’re thinking. Dr. Von Holler, here, could probably think up a
long name for it, because he doodles all the time.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Thank you. This is a piece of paper he
was scribbling on. I can’t figure it out. One minute it looks like a
chimpanzee - and the next minute it looks like a picture of Mr. Cedar.
You look at it, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>insert: of paper</strong>: It is a doodle face.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Dr. Von Holler is somewhat
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Exhibit A - for the defense. Looks kind
of stupid, doesn’t it, Your Honor? But I guess that’s all right if
Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help him think. That’s his business.
Everybody does something different. Some people are� ear-pullers - some
are nail-biters�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: And the lady next to him is a
knuckle-cracker.</p>
<p><strong>334. close shot - cobb</strong>: He swings a key-ring around
his forefinger. Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might get to him, and he
hastily palms the keys and shoves them in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: So you see, everybody does silly things
to help them think. Well, I play the tuba.</p>
<p><strong>337. close shot - mac</strong>: As he bursts forth.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Nice work, toots!</p>
<p><strong>338. close shot - judge</strong>: He glares off scene at Mac,
reprimandingly.</p>
<p><strong>339. close shot - babe</strong>: She is amused at the
embarassment Longfellow has caused them all.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting
people from your home?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those
people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them
out because I didn’t want the party in the first place. I didn’t invite
anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a
freak the “Cinderella Man” was. I don’t know how people like that are
supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example,
I’ll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and
took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I’d have her
examined.</p>
<p><strong>342. med. shot of courtroom</strong>: Featuring Longfellow.
Cedar, who cannot stand it any longer, jumps to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. I
demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to
facts! Let him explain his wanderings around the streets in
underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses!</p>
<p><strong>judge’s voice</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Mr. Cedar’s right. Those things do look
kind of bad, don’t they? But to tell the truth, Your Honor, I don’t
remember them. I guess they happened, all right, because I don’t think a
policeman would lie about a thing like that, but I was drunk. It was the
first time I was ever drunk in my life. It’s probably happened to you,
some time. I mean, when you were younger, of course.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: It’s likely to happen to anybody. Just
the other morning I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar’s own son - about
how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver
sat inside. Isn’t that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn’t that so , Mr. Cedar?</p>
<p><strong>344. med. shot of courtroom</strong>: All eyes have turned to
Cedar.</p>
<p><strong>345. close shot - cedar</strong>: His eyes are beginning to
blaze angrily.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Your Honor, I object.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now about the Falkner sisters. That’s
kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake
Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Jane, who owns the house you live
in?</p>
<p><strong>347. close shot - the sisters</strong>: The girls consult
with each other.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why, you own it, Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes, you own it.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: Do you pay any rent?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, we don’t pay any rent.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Good heavens, no! We never pay rent.</p>
<p><strong>348. wider angle</strong>: As Longfellow continues
questioning:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Are you happy there?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now, Jane, a little while ago you said I
was pixilated. Do you still think so?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why, you’ve always been pixilated,
Longfellow.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s fine. I guess maybe I am. Now
tell me something, Jane. Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated
- except us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>349. med. shot of spectators</strong>: There is an outburst
of laughter which the Judge quickly quells with his gavel.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now, just one more question. Do you see
the Judge here? He’s a nice man, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>jane &amp; amy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Do you think he’s pixilated?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes, indeedy.</p>
<p><strong>351. close shot - cedar</strong>: He feels his case slowly
crumbling.</p>
<p><strong>352. close shot - babe</strong>: She can scarcely conceal her
elation.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, you haven’t yet touched upon a
most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to
give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most
uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Suppose you were living in a small town
and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in
your lap. Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up
your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making
you lose faith in everybody. You’d be a little worried, wouldn’t you?
You’d feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you’d want to
drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler would say you were riding on� �those
bottom waves, ’cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>354. medium shot</strong>: Cedar springs to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: If this man is permitted to carry out his
plan, repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our
entire governmental system!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please, Mr. Cedar! Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Personally, I don’t know what
Mr. Cedar’s raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of
government we have, there will always be leaders and always be
followers.</p>
<p><strong>356. med. close shot</strong>: Farmers in audience, as
Longfellow’s voice continues:</p>
<p><strong>longfellow’s voice</strong>: It’s like the road out in front
of my house. It’s on a steep hill. Every day I watch the cars climbing
up. Some go lickety-split up that hill on high�</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: �some have to shift into second - and
some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again. Same cars -
same gasoline - yet some make it and some don’t. And I say the fellows
who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those
who can’t.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: That’s all I’m trying to do with this
money. Help the fellows who can’t make the hill on high.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: What does Mr. Cedar expect me to do with
it? Give it to him - and a lot of other people who don’t need it?</p>
<p><strong>360. reverse angle</strong>: Showing most of the audience
struggling to their feet.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: See all those fellows? They’re the ones
I’m trying to help. They need it!</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Now, my plan is very simple. I was going
to give each family ten acres - a horse, a cow and some seed. And if
they work the farm for three years, it’s theirs. Now, if that’s crazy,
maybe I ought to be sent to an institution. But I don’t think it is. And
what’s more, Mr. Cedar doesn’t either. Just before the hearing started,
he offered to call the whole thing off if I made a settlement with him.
So you see, he wouldn’t think I was crazy if he got paid off.</p>
<p><strong>363. close shot - cedar</strong>: He jumps to his feet,
highly incensed.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: It’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Cedar!</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped
imagination!</p>
<p><strong>364. close shot - longfellow</strong>: As he listens to
Cedar, watching him antagonistically.</p>
<p><strong>cedar’s voice</strong>: I’ve never heard anything so
colossally stupid in my life!</p>
<p><strong>365. wider angle</strong>: To include Longfellow, Cedar and
Judge.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: It’s an insult to our intelligence to sit
here and listen to his childish ravings.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You will please permit Mr. Deeds to
finish.</p>
<p><strong>cedar</strong>: But Your Honor�</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Cedar!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Anything else, Mr. Deeds?</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>longfellow</strong>: Thank you, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: Order! Order! Order in the
court!</p>
<p><strong>366. full shot of courtroom</strong>: The Judge pounds his
gavel. There are cries of approval from the spectators. In the midst of
the commotion�</p>
<p><strong>367. med. panning shot</strong>: Showing spectators, waiting
breathlessly for a decision. All eyes are on the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>368. close shot at bench</strong>: The Judge holds a
whispered conversation with his experts.</p>
<p><strong>369. close shot - babe</strong>: She is apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>370. close shot - longfellow</strong>: He glances furtively
at Babe, off scene.</p>
<p><strong>371. med. shot of farmers</strong>: Leaning forward. Their
entire future hangs in the balance.</p>
<p><strong>372. med. close shot at bench</strong>: The Judge comes out
of the huddle; his face is very stern.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: Remain seated and come to order.
The Court is again in session.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Before the Court announces its decision, I
want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest
anyone creating a disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>373. quick flashes</strong>: Of Babe - Cobb - Longfellow -
Mac - the farmers.</p>
<p><strong>374. insert: close shot - judge</strong>: The Judge’s preface
augurs ill.</p>
<p><strong>375. closeup - cedar</strong>: His mouth curls up in a
contented grimace.</p>
<p><strong>376. full shot - courtroom</strong>: All eyes are upon the
Judge, who clears his throat.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal of
damaging testimony against you. Your behavior, to say the least, has
been most strange.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: But in the opinion of the Court, you are not
only sane, but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this
courtroom. Case dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>377. close shot - cedar and group</strong>: They sit,
stunned, disappointed. Mrs. Semple turns to her husband and slaps
him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. semple</strong>: You nose-twitcher!</p>
<p><strong>budington</strong>: Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you�</p>
<p><strong>378. close shot - babe</strong>: She smiles ecstatically, too
excited to move. Suddenly she rises.</p>
<p><strong>379. medium shot</strong>: As Babe tries to get to
Longfellow, but finds herself on the fringe of a jubilant crowd in the
center of which is Longfellow. She tries to break through, but finds it
impossible. Desperately, she jumps on a chair and tries frantically to
get a glimpse of him. At that moment, several farmers have lifted
Longfellow on their shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>380. full shot - courtroom</strong>: As jubilantly,
Longfellow is carried out on the shoulders of the excited crowd.</p>
<p><strong>381. medium close shot</strong>: As Babe frantically tries to
reach Longfellow, but is jostled aside. The parade envelops her.</p>
<p><strong>382. long shot from rear</strong>: The shouting mob is
heading for the door at end of courtroom. Everyone crowds forward.</p>
<p><strong>383. close shot in rear</strong>: Babe is left helplessly
out.</p>
<p><strong>384. full shot of courtroom</strong>: Empty - except for the
Falkner sisters, still whispering to each other, and Babe, sitting
helpless and forlorn.</p>
<p><strong>385. close shot - babe</strong>: Her eyes are filled.
Dismally she starts forward. We hear a rising commotion from the
outside, at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>386. wider angle</strong>: Longfellow running toward camera
with the mob, shouting, back of him. He reaches courtroom, slams the
doors shut behind him. Babe, attracted by the noise, looks up. He runs
toward her, and swoops her up in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He’s still pixilated.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He sure is.</p>
