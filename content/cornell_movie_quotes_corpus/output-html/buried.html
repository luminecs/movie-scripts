<h1 id="buried">buried</h1>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What…? What is this? His words become almost
unintelligible as he flails about, though fear is understood in his
every utterance. He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the
coffin walls.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!! He kicks and
slams his hands against the top and sides of the coffin, all to no
avail. His violent movements cause small grains of sand to trickle in
through the space between the sides and top of the coffin, as well as a
small gap that exists between one of the coffin’s broken wooden planks.
Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his dampened
brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines of the coffin is
stifling.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Somebody help me! Please!! Paul continues with
his futile efforts to pry off the top of the coffin. The sides, the top,
the bottom – all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what
surrounds the coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried.
He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble catching his
breath. It takes him some time, but he eventually achieves some
semblance of calm. Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see
that Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and physically
unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American everyman. He coughs.
The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes it hard for him to
breathe. His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He
tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old, frayed ropes
that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task. The incredibly tight
quarters makes his every action nearly impossible. After a lengthy
struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees his hands. A small victory.
Very small. The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down
shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against the walls and
the ceiling of the coffin with every move he makes. He tosses his
button-down shirt down by his feet. His undershirt is drenched through
with sweat. Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in
doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though only his
body-length away, seem miles from him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is this? With his sobbing slowly
subsiding, the coffin soon grows eerily silent. The sound of Paul’s
labored breaths are all we hear, softened under the blanket of absolute
darkness. After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing
sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in the coffin,
by Paul’s feet. He is extremely startled. The buzzing continues, as does
the minimal splashing of light. It’s coming from underneath his
discarded button-down shirt, down near his feet. He lights the Zippo to
get a better look.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on, come on. What was it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Where the hell is it? Son of a…Come
on!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Help me! Please! Somebody help me! His words
barely make it pass the coffin walls. With the cell phone still in hand,
and laboring to reclaim the breath he just expended, Paul turns to
desperation. He dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911.
A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: 911, please hold. The Female
911 Operator places Paul on hold.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No! Wait! Paul accidentally bangs the cap of
the Zippo against the coffin wall, putting out the flame. She quickly
returns.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: 911. What is your
emergency?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: 911. What’s the problem, sir?
Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining coherent.
After a few sparks, the Zippo is re-lit.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m buried. You have to help me. You have to
help me, I can’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m buried in a coffin. Please help me! Send
someone to find me…</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Sir…slow down. What is your
name?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul. Paul Conroy.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Okay, Mister Conroy. Can you
tell me your location?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. I’m in a coffin. I don’t know
where. I’m scared. Please help me.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: You’re in a coffin?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, it’s, like, one of those old, wooden
ones.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Are you at a funeral home?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. I don’t know. No.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: How are calling me right
now?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: If you’re buried in a coffin,
where are you calling from?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A cell phone. There was an old cell phone in
the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: You’re calling from your cell
phone?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. No. It’s not mine, but yes, I’m calling
from a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: There was a cell phone in the
coffin when you climbed in?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t climb in.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: How did you end up in the
coffin, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was put here.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: In the coffin?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Please send help.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: And you’re saying the coffin is
buried?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think so. It’s…it’s hot in here. I can’t
breathe.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Do you know your location,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I told you, I don’t know. Somewhere in
Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. I’m a truck driver, an American. I work
for CRT.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Are you a soldier, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Please, please listen to me. I’m a truck
driver. I work for CRT. I’m a civilian contractor working in Iraq. We
were attacked in Baqubah, they…they…</p>
<p>****: …shot them. All of them.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: They shot who, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All of the other drivers.</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: And you’re saying this happened
in Iraq? The country?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Please, you have to help me. They gave me
a safety number to call, but I had it stored in my wallet and –</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Mister Conroy, this is 911
emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ohio?</p>
<p><strong>female 911 operator</strong>: Yes, sir. I’m not sure exactly
how you called here if you’re in another country, but if you’d like, I
can patch you through to the Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sheriff’s Department? No…you don’t
underst…</p>
<p>****: …forget it. Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and
useless, Paul ends the call. He checks the battery life on the phone. It
still holds steady at two bars. He immediately dials another number, one
that he can recall with ease. He again enters the 001 international code
before making the call. Paul then dials his home phone. It rings several
times, so far unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on, come on. Pick up. Please. After
sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is met with the
answering machine.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thanks for calling the Conroy’s. We’re not
home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. At the sound
of the Beep, Paul leaves a frenzied, rambling message.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Linda, honey, it’s me. Listen, I need you to
contact the National Guard right away. Or the Pentagon. Tell them we
were attacked in the Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They have to find me. Please help me, baby.
Please help them find me. Paul hangs up. He dials his wife’s cell phone
right away. After several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up. We
hear the sound of Linda, Paul’s wife, on her outgoing message.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day. The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears
into his voice message.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Linda, it’s Paul. I need you to call me right
away. This is an absolute emergency. Call the number that comes up on
your phone. Call me at that number. If I don’t answer, call the Pentagon
or the F.B.I. I don’t know what the hell is going on, but I’m buried in
a box… Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. The gravity
of the situation fully takes hold.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …I can’t breathe in here. Make sure you call
me right away. Please, baby, please call me.</p>
<p><strong>411 operator</strong>: What city and state, please?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Um…I don’t know. The F.B.I., wherever they
are. Paul reaches for his button-down shirt. Fishes for pens stashed in
his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pressed to his ear with his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>411 operator</strong>: Do you have a specific city you’d like
to be connected to, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t care, any city. Just connect me to the
F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>411 operator</strong>: Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices
listed in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Haven, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Denver – Paul cannot bear to listen any further to this list
that seemingly never ends.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anywhere! Any city, just connect me,
please!</p>
<p><strong>411 operator</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not allowed to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fine, um…Chicago. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>411 operator</strong>: Please hold for your number. Paul is
transferred to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.</p>
<p><strong>automated message</strong>: The number you requested,
312-421-</p>
<p><strong>automated message</strong>: …can be connected for an
additional charge of twenty-five cents by pressing the number one. He
presses the number one and is connected directly. After a few rings,
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS answers.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Chicago field office. Special
Agent Harris.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Yes it is, sir.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m calling from Iraq. I’m buried in the
desert somewhere. I need you to help me –</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down.
When were you in Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now. I’m there now. I’m a truck driver for
CRT. I’ve been here for nine months.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: May I have your name please,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Conroy.</p>
<p>****: Paul Conroy. Okay, Paul, explain to me what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Alright. Me and a convoy of other drivers were
delivering kitchen parts to a community center. As we got closer, a
bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. Then an IED went off
up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. These guys came out from
behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there
on the street.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Were you shot at?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know. I was way in the
back of the convoy. I must have got hit in the head with one of the
rocks and got knocked out. That’s the last thing I remember. But now I
just woke up, and I was tied up and buried in a coffin.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Who put you there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess whoever ambushed us.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: A bunch of kids?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, you’re not listening. The kids threw the
rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys – maybe insurgents, I don’t
fucking know – popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: I thought you said they didn’t
shoot at you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They didn’t, I don’t know! But they shot
them!</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Sir, you’re going to have to
stop shouting if –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m shouting because you’re not listening! I
need you to help me! Please!!</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Hmmm… Paul takes a moment to
center himself.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can you trace my call? GPS or something?</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Why is it that they didn’t
shoot you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have no idea. They didn’t, that’s all I
know.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: What’s your social security
number, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why? Who cares? I’m buried in the middle of
the fucking desert! Who cares what my social security number is?! I’m an
American citizen. Just send someone to find me!</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Do you know where you’re
…lo…if…dy.. The cell phone starts breaking up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? What? I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>special agent harris</strong>: Bet…un…near…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?! Hello?! Paul checks the phone’s
display, where he sees that the call has been lost.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit!! Cell phone service temporarily goes
down. Paul lights the Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen. He
tries to make a call, but nothing happens. He shakes the phone, moves it
around the coffin, all in desperate hope that he will get a signal. He
soon does.</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: Thank you for calling Crestin, Roland
and Thomas. How may I direct your call?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Somebody, I need to talk to someone right
away. It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: Who is this, please?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Conroy. I’m a driver for you guys. I’m
calling from Iraq. My convoy was attacked.</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: Sir, if this is a crisis situation you
need to contact the Safety Number your were provided.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know, I know, but I don’t have it. They took
it.</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: Who took it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Iraqis, I think. I don’t remember, I
blacked out.</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: I’m going to put you through to Alan
Davenport.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Davenport? Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>crt operator</strong>: Director of Personnel. Please
hold.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Personnel? No, I need to talk – Paul is placed
on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in the background of the phone,
maddening Paul further. Over the music, a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard,
speaking a recorded testimonial during the on-hold message.</p>
<p><strong>crt spokesman</strong>: At CRT, we work with our clients to
provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face
in our fast-growing, global economy. As the premiere…</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: You’ve reached Alan Davenport,
personnel director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. Please leave your name
and number at the tone and I will return your call as soon as possible.
The BEEP sounds. Paul is confused as to why he was patched through to
someone in human resources, but leaves a message nevertheless.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is Paul Conroy, I’m from Hastings,
Michigan. I’m a driver for CRT, and my convoy was ambushed…by insurgents
or terrorists. I don’t know. I don’t know who it was. I’m stuck in the
ground, buried in a coffin and I need help. Please send help. I’m
begging you. I think I’m in Baqubah in the Diyala Provence. Please send
help right away. I can’t breathe in here. I can’t…please. I’m begging
you. I don’t know who else to call.</p>
<p>****: …fuck. Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still
emitting its glow. He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. He
screams and flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the
walls of the coffin. His animalistic outburst causes the phone to close.
The coffin returns to pitch black. After a long beat, Paul lights the
Zippo, which remains wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole
in the wall of the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? After a
beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the phone. He also hears
a discordance of background sound; the din of a room filled with
Arabic-speaking men.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? Who are you? Please, you have to help
me. Still, Paul’s words are only met with slow, measured breaths.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who is this? Hello? The person on the other
end eventually speaks. An Iraqi man, JABIR, talks forcefully and
aggressively in broken English.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Breathe no breathe, American? Ah? Breathe no
breathe?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What? I don’t know what you’re saying. Who is
this?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: American can breathe no breathe?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, I can’t breathe. Please get me out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Get out?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, please get me out. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Soldier.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, no I’m not a soldier. I’m a truck driver.
That’s it. I’m not a soldier. I’m a contractor.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Contractor?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, that’s right. A contractor. Not a
soldier.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Blackwater.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, not for Blackwater. I’m not a security
contractor. Truck driver, I’m a truck driver. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You are American.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Then you are soldier. Despair falls upon
Paul. It becomes clear that Jabir is responsible for all of this. As
such, Paul crosses out the word “HELP?” Closes the lid of the Zippo,
leaving only the cell phone display screen to illuminate his face.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, I’m not. I’m here unarmed. But, you still
shot at us.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: In head and in throat, so you tell no more
lies.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not lying! We were all drivers.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Drive what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Trucks. The big trucks you see driving around
with the supplies? That’s us. That’s me. We’re not soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Five million money.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Five million money tonight by nine PM or you
stay. Buried like dog.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Five million dollars? From who?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Your family.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My family doesn’t have five million dollars.
If they did, I wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: From Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know, yes, the Embassy will pay you.
If you let me go, they’ll pay you the money. Silence on the other end of
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Nine PM, five million money. Jabir hangs up
the phone, forcing Paul to instantly come to grips with the fact that he
is being held hostage. He lays back in the coffin, shell-shocked.
Physically spent, the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the
floor. The display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin.</p>
<p>****: Come on, what’s her number?</p>
<p><strong>male 411 operator</strong>: What city and listing,
please?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hastings, Michigan. I’m looking for Donna
Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>male 411 operator</strong>: I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.
One on Federal Road and one on Ardmore Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ardmore Avenue…I think. Yeah. Shit, I don’t
know. Just give me that one.</p>
<p><strong>male 411 operator</strong>: Ardmore Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, Ardmore Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>male 411 operator</strong>: Please hold for your number. Paul
is switched to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.</p>
<p><strong>automated message</strong>: The number you requested,
269-948- 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty-five
cents by pressing the number one. Paul writes Donna’s number and name on
the top of the coffin and then presses the number one. He is connected.
Her phone rings and rings. Paul’s frustration is evident.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on! Where the hell is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Hello? Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly
places the phone to his ear.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Donna, it’s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Hey, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s Linda? She’s not answering her phone.
I need to talk to her, I’ve been taken hostage by… Donna interrupts. We
realize, as does Paul, that her voice was actually coming from her
answering machine.</p>
<p>****: Fooled you. I’m not really home. But if you leave a message,
I’ll get back to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye. His hand falls to his
forehead, defeated.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Donna, I need to talk to Linda. It’s an
absolute emergency. Have her call me. Use star sixty-nine and find out
the number I’m calling from and have her call me… Donna picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Donna.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t talked to her all
day. Call her cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you near a computer or something?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Uh…yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Turn it on.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: It is on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look up the number for the State Department
for me.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I was just heading out to the supermarket. I
really don’t have</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Donna, please, please, please – just get me
the number.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No! Everything is not alright! So, please,
just look up the number.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Don’t fucking yell at me, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not yelling!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Yes you are. Just like you did last year at
the cookout. I’m not going to tolerate –</p>
<p>****: Just get me the fucking number!! Get me the number, get me the
number!! Donna hangs up on him. Realizing this, Paul bangs his fists and
claws at the top of the coffin, bloodying some of his fingers and
knuckles in the process. He violently tosses and turns and screams at
the top of his lungs, like an animal trapped in a cage. Tears spray from
his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of his shudder.
He eventually calms quite a bit. Sniffing away tears and taking notice
of the damage he’s done to his hands, Paul slows his breathing as best
he can.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What? It takes every ounce of Paul’s being to
keep himself from going off the deep end. He takes a beat to compose
himself and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate
response.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Donna, I’m very sorry I yelled. But, I’m only
going to ask you once more to get me this number. If you don’t get me
this number, I’m going to die.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t have time to explain. Please…the
number.</p>
<p>****: Hold on. We hear Donna put down the phone. In the b.g., we hear
the sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard. After a beat,
she picks the phone back up.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Okay…State Department. It’s 202-</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Yeah. Paul writes the number on the top of
the coffin, beneath the man others. He writes the initials “S.D.” next
to it.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What the hell’s going – Paul hangs up on
Donna mid-sentence. He dials the number the State Department right away.
A STATE DEPARTMENT REP answers after a few rings.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: United States Department of
State.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m an American citizen, working in Iraq. I’ve
been taken hostage. I need to speak to someone right away.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: Where are you calling from,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: From Iraq. I’m a truck driver for CRT –
Crestin, Roland and Thomas. We were attacked and now I’m being held for
ransom.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: Are the kidnappers with
you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. I’m buried somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: You’re buried?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. It’s an old
coffin, I think.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: Did you try contacting the
military out there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t have the number.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: What number?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was given a number to call, a safety number.
But the people took it.</p>
<p><strong>state department rep</strong>: The people holding you
hostage?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know…hold on. Let me connect you…hold on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Wait… Paul is placed on hold. As he waits,
his eyes wander around the coffin. He looks at the numbers he has
written.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Rebecca Browning.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes, hello. I was just informed of your
situation.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, my situation. I’m running out of time
and you people keep putting me on hold. What the hell is wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t be sorry. Just help me.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I just have a few questions for you, Mister
Conroy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s important that I get this information.
It will make a rescue</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait, wait, wait…how did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I never gave you my name. I don’t think I gave
it to the other guy, either. Rebecca is silent on the other end of the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What the hell is going on right now?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We received a call from a representative at
CRT. You left him a message?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: He contacted us right away.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, since you know what the hell is going
on, what have you done to get me out of here?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: There’s little we can do from
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, that’s it? I’m just supposed to rot in
here because there’s little you can do?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I need to know where you were when your
convoy was ambushed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In the Diyala Provence. In Baqubah.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Okay. And has contact been made with the
kidnappers?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. The guy told me that he wants five
million dollars by nine o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Or else…?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Or else he’ll bring me to Sea World. What do
you think, lady? Even faced with Paul’s sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid.
Professional.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We’ll do everything we can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So you’ll pay them?</p>
<p>****: No. That we can’t do.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait…what?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s the policy of the United States
government to not negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To hell with that! It’s easy for you to worry
about policy, you’re sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere,
probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch. You’re not the one stuck
in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I understand your frustration –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Frustration? Lady, I’m going to fucking die in
here. Understand that! Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.
Paul wonders if she is still there. The idea of being alone again scares
him terribly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The
reflection of the flame dances on his frightened eyes.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, then say something. Tell me how you’re
going to get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What’s the number on the phone you’re
calling from?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. Did it come up on your end?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No. It’s listed as unavailable. Do this –
take down this number.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Dan Brenner. He’s the commander of the
Hostage Working Group over in Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hostage Working Group?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We formed it in 2004 to deal with
situations such as yours. Paul shakes his head in disgust.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Situations. I love how you keep calling it
that.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Did you write down the number?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Good. Hold on, I’ll connect you with him
now. He should be expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about the news? I’m going to call
them.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No. Do not, I repeat, do not contact the
news.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It will only complicate things further and
threaten your chances of rescue. Paul doesn’t buy it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s bullshit. You’re just covering your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No, I’m covering yours. Everyone who needs
to know about this does.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t go looking for something if you
don’t know it’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That’s why you need to contact Dan Brenner
right away. Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon
acquiesces to Rebecca’s pleas for him not to.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m transferring you now.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Brenner.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dan Brenner?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Is this Paul Conroy?</p>
<p>****: Yes, yes it’s me. It’s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul, I was informed of what’s going on. I want
you to know that we’re already working on trying to get you out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, thank you, God.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I was told that we have until 9pm. Is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Alright. That doesn’t give us a whole lot of
time. And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the
ground?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Okay. My guess is that since you’re able to get
a cell signal, you’re no more than a few feet underground.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What about battery life? How much does the
phone have left? Paul looks at the display to find out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Less than half.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Okay. You have to conserve that battery. Our
best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal. Is the ringer
set on a sound or vibrate?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Vibrate.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Press and hold down the asterisk key to change
it to a ring tone. It will use less power.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about my Zippo?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You have a lighter?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Use it to look around for markings, a logo –
whatever you can find.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Won’t it use up oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not much. Don’t worry about that now. Try to
find –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s really dark in here without it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I understand, Paul. Try to find anything in
there that might indicate where that coffin was made.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You guys have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re working as fast as we can, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do you know if there were any other
survivors?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: From your convoy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s still unclear at this point.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just wanted to do right by my family. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t know it was going to be like this
over here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t think any of us did. While on the phone
with Brenner, Paul gets another call coming in. He checks the display
and reads the number. Matching it against a number he wrote on the top
of the coffin, he sees that is Jabir calling.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s him. He’s calling.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The kidnapper?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You know his number?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about the call?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Give me the number first. The phone has rung
several times. Paul fears that Jabir may hang up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s going to hang up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Take the call.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Take the call. Now. Paul complies with Dan’s
demand and switches to the other line.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Two hour, six minute. Paul looks at his
watch. Indeed, he has but two hours and six minutes until the time
reaches 9pm.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You have to give me more time.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You talk to embassy? They give money?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. No. I talked to…someone. Government. They
said that they won’t pay the money.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No pay?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. They said that they don’t negotiate with
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Terrorists? I am terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You are terrified, so I am terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What did I ever do to you?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Ever do?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. I’m here because it’s a job, to make
money. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: I have job until you come. Now, my family
have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s not my fault! Jabir retorts with a
spirited conviction similar to Paul’s.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Nine, one, one was not my fault, but still
you are here! Saddam was not my fault, but still you are here!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I told you, I’m only here to work. To help
rebuild.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Rebuild what you destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stop! Just please, stop! I’m just a guy. I’m
just a truck driver. Okay? I’m nobody that makes decisions about
anything. I just want to go home. Silence from the other end of the
phone for an extended period of time.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You make video, ransom video. This
surprisingly comes as good news to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Please. Get me out of here and I’ll make
the video.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No. You make video now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What…? How?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You use video on phone. Paul’s hopes are
dashed. His sanguine head falls back onto the coffin floor.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Near foot. You read note near foot in box.
Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet. He doesn’t
see anything.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where? I don’t see –</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Near foot. Read note inside box. Paul
repositions his legs as best he can. He can vaguely see the corner of a
small metal box, partially sticking out of a broken plank on the bottom
of the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The video…if I make it, will you let me
go?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Only if we get money.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nobody’s going to pay five million dollars for
me.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: We take less. One million money.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If they pay it, will you let me go?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: One million money. Jabir hangs up, ending the
call. Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir has
just told him. He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the
protruding corner of the metal box, but it’s positioned in such a way
that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it. Paul then tries to
clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he
realizes that a new strategy is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thanks for calling the Conroy’s. We’re not
home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Paul’s eyes
well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of his son’s voice. The Beep
is heard. Paul hangs up without leaving a message. He looks at the time.
It’s 7:02pm. Battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars. He
remembers something.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. Paul presses and holds down the shortcut
button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible
tone. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul dials Dan Brenner.
After a few rings, Dan answers.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here’s his number…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hold on. Alright, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s 07902-24-921. Dan says something to
someone who is in the room with him, and then returns his attention to
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This is huge. Unless they’re using a cloned
line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about me? Can you track my cell
signal?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re having a lot of trouble with yours. Seems
to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That…it’s not going to be easy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He wants me to make a ransom video.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No. Hold off for as long as you can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If it’s going to get me out of here, I’m
making it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The last thing we want is for this to end up
all over Al Jazeera.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We? Paul becomes angry, again sensing that
more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing
him.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This can’t turn into an international
incident.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s all you people care about! But what
about me? Don’t you care about me?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We do. That’s why we’re –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No you don’t! You people don’t care about any
of us. I’ve had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. We
don’t have any guns, any armor. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re not soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell that to the people who put me in this
box! Tell that to the people who shot my friends!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re doing the best we can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, you’re not. All you people understand are
your secret plans and your back room politics.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If I were some diplomat or something, maybe
even a hostage working group leader – or whatever your fancy title is,
I’d be out of here by now. Wouldn’t I? But I’m not, so I’m just supposed
to keep my mouth shut and die.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I need you to stay focused, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fuck you. Dan’s heard enough.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary
concern. Bottom line. And we’re searching just as hard as we would be
for a four-star general, so don’t literally waste your breath suggesting
otherwise. Paul does not respond at first. Dan’s retort clearly has an
effect on him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who are they? The people who put me here?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They’re just that – people. No different from
you and me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m no terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Neither are they.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: If you were homeless, starving…actually, I take
that back. If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do
for them?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I wouldn’t kill someone.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How can you be sure?</p>
<p>****: What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They’re criminals, desperate ones at that. They
don’t care about anything other than getting the money.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So pay them, then.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Trust me, if it was an option, I would do that
in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How many others have there been?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Since I got here? Hundreds. Journalists,
contractors, soldiers…hundreds have been taken. It’s one of the only
functioning businesses out here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How many have you rescued? Dan is reluctant to
answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How many?</p>
<p>****: Not many.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tell me their names.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Any of them. Make me know they really do
matter to you.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Mark White.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who was Mark White?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty- six years
old. Med student. Came over here to help out local doctors.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Insurgents grabbed him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: About three weeks ago. Paul writes “MARK WHITE”
on the top of the coffin, below the list of phone numbers. He circles
the name.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You remember his name.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I remember all their names.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did he…? Is he…? The glow stick begins to
fade.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he’s alive. Hearing this
affords Paul some semblance of relief. Paul shakes the glow stick,
returning it to its full strength.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Home. Probably happy to be back at school.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We found him; we’ll find you, too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We already have a solid lead on the number you
gave us.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: A unit’s on it’s way over there now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s…that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What should I do in the meantime?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know it’s hard, but try to relax. The more
worked up you are, the more air you’re going to use.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t help it. I’m always anxious. I take
pills for it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Do you have them with you? Paul checks his
pants pockets. He removes a small, orange pill bottle.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Take them. You need to preserve your oxygen
level any way you can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Is your Zippo still lit.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I feel nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You have to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: And you need to save that battery. We’re
expecting some intel in about ten minutes. Call me back then.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Just hang in there, Paul. The glow stick begins
to slowly fade. Paul shakes it, causing it to brighten only momentarily
before dimming again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. I’m trying. Dan ends the call. Paul lets
out a deep breath, finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement.
He looks at his watch. It’s now 7:18pm. The ticking sound of the second
hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the extreme silence of the
coffin. Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the
display, Paul sees that it is Jabir. Paul answers.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Did you make video?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Jabir yells something in Arabic to the
other Iraqi men we hear in the background. Collectively, they do not
sound pleased. Slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to
tell for sure.</p>
<p>****: You make video!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let me out and I’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No! You make video now. In box.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t. I can’t read the paper.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Make video now!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t. I don’t know what you want me to say.
I can’t read the paper. Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear
arguing in the background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear
from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile.
Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You make video now. Jabir ends the call. Paul
closes the phone to help conserve battery life. He then reopens the
phone and scrolls through the menu options. Everything is written in
Arabic. He eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera – the
video function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the viewfinder.
After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and growing more
panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid, utilizing a great deal of
oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m never getting out of here. Paul begins to
freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against
the sides and top. The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering
very little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness.
Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the flashlight. Click-click.
Click-click. Nothing. He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white
light turns on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which
causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits momentarily.
Paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good
whacks.</p>
<p><strong>nursing home nurse</strong>: Mountain View Nursing Home.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne
Conroy, please.</p>
<p><strong>nursing home nurse</strong>: Um…okay. Ah…let me bring the
cordless phone to her room. Hold on a moment, please. We hear the Nurse
walk down the tiled corridor floor. She soon reaches Paul’s mother’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>nursing home nurse</strong>: Misses Conroy, you have a
telephone call, dear. Here, you can use this phone. Paul’s mother,
MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but confused. It’s clear that
she suffers from advanced stages of Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mom…it’s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s Paul, Mom. Your son.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: My son?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s okay, Mom. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s your son, Mom. It’s Paulie.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Paulie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax
Street, in the duplex. Remember?</p>
<p>****: Paulie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Is this Paulie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It is, Mom. It’s Paulie. How’s everything at
the home?</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Very nice. Your father and I have been
playing gin rummy every night. It’s almost too much for Paul to take. He
cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah…I don’t think Pop’s there with you,
Mom.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: How are you doing, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not very good. This…uh, this may be the last
time I talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: That’s nice, honey.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you get the flowers I sent a few months
ago?</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Flowers?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, I sent…never mind. Listen, I…I’m going
to go now. I just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. I
love you, Mom. Maryanne doesn’t respond.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you hear me? Mom? I told you…do you want
to tell me you</p>
<p><strong>maryanne</strong>: Yes, dear. Your father and I have been
playing gin rummy every night.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi. Paul ends the
call and instantly begins crying his heart out. He lays there, sobbing
relentlessly. After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly
different than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems
hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening. He mindlessly presses
the shortcut button, resetting the ring to vibrate mode. He eventually
picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on the other end. It’s then
that he sees that it was not a call that came in, but instead was a
picture message. Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the
incoming picture begins to download. Several seconds later, the picture
downloads and an image appears on the display of Paul’s cell phone. It’s
of a woman – bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her
head.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh no. No, no, no! Paul frantically dials the
number to reach Jabir. As soon as the phone connects, Paul begins his
desperate plea.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Video make?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let her go. Please. Please don’t hurt her. The
Woman is heard in the background of Jabir’s phone, crying muffled words
through her muzzled mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: We shoot her if you no make video.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No! No, please no shoot. No shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You get money. American million.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I will, I promise. Just don’t shoot her. She’s
a mother, she’s got two kids.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Two kids?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. She has two kids.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: I have five. Now only one. You make video.
Now!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No wait!! I give three seconds.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t read the paper.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Three…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Wait!</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Two…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know what you want me to say!</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay! Okay, I’ll make the video. Just, please,
don’t shoot. Jabir does not fire his gun. Paul attempts to catch his
breath.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need to hang up to make the video. Okay? Is
that okay?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You have three minute to send video.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fuck… He drops the paper to his side and opens
the phone, setting it to the video record function. He places the
flashlight close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the
small, phone display screen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My name is Paul Conroy. I’m an American
citizen from Hastings, Michigan. I’m a civilian truck driver for
Crestin, Roland and Thomas. I’ve been taken hostage somewhere in
Iraq…and I need one million dollars by nine o’clock tonight, Baghdad
time, or else I’ll be left to die in this coffin I’m buried in. I’ve
been told that if… The flashlight goes out. Paul continues speaking in
the darkness. After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns back
on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …the money is paid, I will be let go. If it’s
not, I will die in here. These threats are real and will be followed
through on. Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not
saying anything further. He saves the message and then sends it to
Jabir. We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video has
been sent. Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his
temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. He tries to control his
breathing and remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, no, no!! Desperately straining every
muscle in his body, he extends his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping
to move it away from the spilled alcohol. He still can’t reach it, yet
he tries with all his might. The phone stops ringing. He has missed the
call. He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away and
his breath is not strong enough to do much more than cause it to
flicker. With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul
reaches for his shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching his foot almost
impossible. He struggles to undo the laces and remove it from his foot.
With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul finally
removes his shoe. The mere inch of leg room this creates allows him to
slide his leg out from under him. The trail of alcohol is just about to
come into contact with the flame – – but Paul deftly maneuvers his body
just in time to awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the
lid. Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim light
of the damaged glow stick. He notices another hole in the coffin. As a
precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth that had previously been used to
gag him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There you are. We see, on the display of the
phone, that Paul has found a listing of languages. He scrolls past many
– “FRANCAIS, DETSCHE, ESPANOL” – stopping at “ENGLISH.” Presses the
button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable. He quickly
navigates to the Tools menu. Scrolls down. Locates the number of the
cell phone he is using. He scribbles the number onto the top of the
coffin. Then a second pass, making it bolder than the others. Paul then
dials his wife’s cell phone. After only a few rings, he is met by her
voice mail.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day. The beep sounds, and Paul frantically
proceeds right into his message.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Linda, here’s the number for the phone. I just
found it out. It’s 07902-42-884. You have to use the international
calling code first.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Please call me as soon as you get this. I love
you…I love you. Call me right away. Please. Paul hangs up. He looks at
the battery life left on the phone. One bar. He then checks his watch.
It’s 8:19pm. Both are not good signs, and he knows it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh shit. He begins to panic. Grabbing the
pocket knife that was left inside the metal box, he slides the blade in
the space between the sides of the coffin and the top. Paul grabs the
glow stick. But, because it was partially melted to the floor, the stick
snaps in two. Liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that
remains stuck the floor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Son of a… Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it
on. It works for a second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces
intermittent beams of light. He turns the top, switching to the red
bulb. It works. The coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too,
goes out. Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. It
works. He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use the
knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bending the blade well
past its design, it nearly breaks off its handle. The flashlight turns
off. After a good shaking, it turns back on, emitting white light. With
oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind are all too
much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try to catch his breath. As he
endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings. Not a call this
time, but instead a video message. It has been sent by Jabir. Paul’s
trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming video may show.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My name is Pamela Gorham. I’m a food service
worker at F.O.B. Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas. My
captors’ requests for ransom have gone unanswered, and – The Woman,
Pamela, looks off-screen to her right. Someone is fast approaching her.
She cowers, protectively holding her bound hands in front of her face as
she screams.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No…wait!! Please – no!! Another Iraqi man
steps into the camera’s line of site, a handgun already brandished.
Without as much as a moment’s hesitation, he fires two rounds directly
into Pamela’s head, killing her.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No! No, no, no!!! Still in the throes of
emotional torment, Paul vomits on himself. He doubles over, only to
vomit once again. His body, taxed almost to the point of complete
physical breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vomit-
smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the coffin, Paul
stares into nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Why the hell did you make that video?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s all a bunch of lies.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What is? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All of it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: All of what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nobody gives a shit about any of us. We’re
nothing to you people.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re going to find you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: By looking the other way?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You can’t start breaking on me now, Paul. You
have to stay strong.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You let her die.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They shot her…and you didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We didn’t even know she had been taken
hostage.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She sent three videos.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s what they told her to say.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That your ransom video already has 47,000 hits
on YouTube. And all the major networks are playing it, including Al
Jazeera. So, now your captors have no choice but to follow through.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I found out the number to this phone.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I found a way to change the display language.
I figured that out, and you didn’t. Why?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Because I didn’t. Just like you and every other
person on this planet, there are some things I know and some things I
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then how are you ever going to find me?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Their signal was cloned, like we figured. But,
we’re close. Real close.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about mine?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re working on that, too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m near a Mosque. I could hear the call to
prayer over the P.A.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Good. That means that we’re in the right
area.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re nearby?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I spoke with soldiers from the third ID who
were escorting your convoy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re alive? After a beat:</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not all of them. Both Bradley tanks were hit
with IEDs. The rest got caught in small arms fire.</p>
<p>****: What the hell happened out there, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul. After a beat:</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed
okay. We knew that a bunch of our CB radios had been stolen and that the
Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual
channels. Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander. She
wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from
base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the C.C. As we headed down
the road, all these kids came running into the street. Dozens of them.
It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster
than they thought we would. So they run on up in front of me, and I slam
on my brakes. The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so
they kept going. Next thing I know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an
IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman’s hit, Sandman’s
hit. He’s…he’s everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s when the Iraqis came out of their mud
huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. I
couldn’t believe what was happening. It seemed like slow- motion, like I
was watching it on TV. People – my friends – were getting killed, and
all I could do is watch. I didn’t even notice that the kids were
throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. Sort of
snapped me out of my trance. But then, I guess I got hit in the head
with a rock, `cause I blacked out.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Do you happen to remem…mo… nea… The cell phone
service begins to cut out. Suddenly, the coffin begins to vibrate
slightly, dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood
bottom, followed by the faint sound of an explosion. Within seconds, the
explosions grow louder and more proximate. The vibration becomes so
intense that it violently shakes Paul around the coffin. The sound of
jet plane engines are heard coming from above, flying by as the massive
explosions continue. Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and
sides of the coffin as it shakes. Paul does his best to brace himself,
but the bombardment is far too powerful.</p>
<p>****: Oh no…no… Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting.
White light shines, but then goes out. He shakes the flashlight and it
stays on, shining its normal white beam.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This can’t be happening. We see that Dan
Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that the display menu shows an
icon of a phone with a line through it – No Service Available. Once he
feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body away from the
crack. Although slightly caved, it does not show any more signs of
possible collapse. Sweat drenches his face. His eyes affixed, in utter
disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling in around
him inch-by-inch.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Come on. Please work. He shakes the cell
phone and moves it all around the coffin, hoping that it may somehow
help. His efforts are futile. The flashlight goes dead. He hits it,
shakes it. It turns back on. The brightness is diminished. Still the
sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of
granules. Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answers
right away.</p>
<p>****: Hello? Hello? Who’s there? Alan Davenport answers calmly from
the other end.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Is this Paul Conroy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Paul, my name’s Alan Davenport, I’m
the personnel director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I left you a message.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: You did. I also heard from Rebecca
Browning over at the State Department. Are you able to speak on the
status of your situation?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s worse. There was an explosion or
something. The coffin’s breaking, there’s sand pouring in from
everywhere. I only have a half an hour before –</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Okay, okay. Slow down. You should
try to stay calm. Tell me something, Paul, who have you spoken to?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The hostage takers, Dan Brenner from the
hostage working group –</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Okay, Paul. I’m with you. How about
the media. I know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly
to anyone about what’s going on? The flashlight goes out. Paul hits it a
few times and it turns back on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: That’s good. It needs to stay that
way. It’s important that we keep this situation as contained as
possible. Paul finds Alan’s obvious concern with doing damage control to
be infuriating.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: About three inches to my right, there’s a
wall. Three inches to my left, there’s another wall. And about four
inches above my head, there’s a roof that’s about to collapse and drown
me in sand. I think this situation is pretty contained.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I know you’re upset –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Help me! Help me! What are you going to do to
help me?!</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I know you’re upset. And, from what
I’ve been told, steps are being taken to get you out of there. So,
hopefully it won’t be much longer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Yes, thank God.</p>
<p>****: I’m going to switch on a recorder right now. Just a second…
Paul’s visage expresses his confusion. A click is heard in the b.g. of
Alan’s phone, followed by a low, steady hum. Alan’s speech becomes very
laconic. His questions are clearly being read from a Human Resources
handbook of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: This is Alan Davenport, Personnel
Director for Crestin, Roland and Thomas, Incorporated. The date is
October 23, 2006. I am speaking with Paul Conroy. Mister Conroy, are you
aware that I’m recording this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Please answer the question. The
flashlight goes out again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. Paul hits it, but it does not catch. He
sits in darkness.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Mister Conroy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Yes!</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: And do I have your permission to do
so?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why do you need my permission? What is all
this?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I need you to answer yes or no,
please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Alright? Yes! Paul hits the flashlight.
It turns back on.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy, when
were you hired by CRT?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: About nine months ago. Around January of 2005.
Why are you wasting time with this?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I have your official date of hire as
January 4th, 2005. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who cares? This is fucking crazy –</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: January 4th, 2005. Is that
correct?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were hired.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean when I came down there to Dallas and
you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have
bulletproof glass? The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it,
returning it to full strength.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean when you told us that things were
safer than ever over here? Is that when I was made aware?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I need you to answer yes or no,
please.</p>
<p>****: Yes. The flashlight begins to slowly dim.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: During that time, did you also
receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly
explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of
employment?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: It’s our understanding that you were
taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. That’s completely correct. What is the
point of all this?</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they
understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company. As
of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait, wait, wait – The flashlight dims even
more.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: It was brought to our attention that
you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee – Pamela
Gorham.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Wait –</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Stipulated in your contract was a
fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly that any
relationship, be it romantic or sexual in nature, deemed inappropriate
by CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We…we were just friends.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Our records indicate
differently.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: We’re also legally required to
inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ
of CRT at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for
any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of
termination. Therefore, in your case, that includes this incident or any
consequences that may result from it. Paul sees where Alan is going with
this. He’s thunderstruck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about my insurance money? My family will
need that money…</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Given that you were alive up until
the time of your termination –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You son of a bitch. You can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Do you understand everything –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t do this! Alan takes a second before
trying again.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Do you understand everything you’ve
been told, Mister Conroy? Paul does not answer.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: Mister Conroy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: That concludes our interview with
Paul Conroy. I am now turning off the recorder. A click is heard. The
humming ceases.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You people can’t just wash your hands of this.
You bastards put me here.</p>
<p><strong>alan davenport</strong>: I’m sorry. Alan ends the call. Paul
looks at the phone – it is still holding a steady signal. Battery life,
however, is running quite low. All that remains is one blinking bar,
indicating that Paul has very little battery life left. He shakes his
hand free of the pile of sand that now covers it and looks at his watch.
It’s 8:31pm. The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely. Only
the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Answer the phone!! Paul tries Jabir once
again, but still he does not answer the phone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why won’t you answer?!! It’s then that
something occurs to Paul. He stares at the crack in the top of the
coffin and the sand that pours in at an alarmingly fast rate. The crack
has split Jabir’s written phone number in half. The aerial bombing. He
wonders how it may have affected Jabir and, consequently, his own
chances of survival. He places his hand under the point from where the
sand pours in most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through
his fingers. The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount
of oxygen. Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well
that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take. He then
calls Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Brenner answers. Paul is
surprisingly serene.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just do.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Three F-16s levelled parts of the city a few
minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know. I felt it. Did they know I was here?
The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did they care? Dan does not answer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: These people that took me – if they’re dead,
they can’t tell you where I am.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We can still try to track down your signal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You tried that already.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We can try again. Paul appreciates Dan’s
effort, but he knows there is little hope left for him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s over, isn’t it? After a long beat:</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: No. Paul doesn’t say a word. He knows that Dan
is lying. After a beat, Dan comes clean.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right – just like everyone else on the
planet, there are some things you know and some things you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I wish this could have gone differently.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah…me too. After a long beat, Paul ends the
call. He forces a smile to his lachrymose face. Utterly hopeless, he
opens the phone and turns on the video feature. He turns the phone to
face himself, projecting his image on the display. He presses
Record.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social Security
number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68. This video will serve as my
last will and testament. To my wife, Linda Conroy, I leave the seven
hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever I have left in my
annuity. To my son, Shane Conroy, I…I don’t know. I don’t have anything
else. My stuff, like, my clothes. I wish I had more…I wish I had done
more. Your dad wasn’t really much of anything, Shane, I’m sorry. Maybe
if I was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, I
would have more to leave you. But, you can be one of those people if you
want. You can be whatever you want. Just promise me that when you get
older, you’ll take good care of your mom. And promise me that you’ll
always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I love you very much,
Shane. Maybe I never said that enough…maybe I did, I don’t even know.
That probably means I didn’t.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, Linda. I should have listened to you. Paul ends the
video and closes the phone. He carefully places the phone into his
pocket, where it may hopefully be found if he ever is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re not dead. Jabir is heard speaking
frantically in Arabic to the several other people in the room with
him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello? Hello?! Jabir turns his attention to
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Where is money?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: What don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Liar!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not lying! I swear.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Swear?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: From Embassy, you get money now!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You will!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need more time. Please. Paul shakes and hits
the flashlight. It still does not work.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No more time!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There’s sand pouring in here. I can’t…it’s
everywhere. Please, let me out of here and I will get you the money.
Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to him,
seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from the same
individual. Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the
positioning of the batteries. Screws the cap back on. Hits the switch.
Nothing. Jabir returns to the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You show blood.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What? Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight
again. Removes the batteries. Bites down on them a few times. Blows hard
inside the flashlight tube.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You show blood, they give money.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You cut off thumb finger, send video.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not doing that.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Yes! Paul puts the batteries back inside the
flashlight. Begins screwing on the cap.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right, no. You let me out of here, and
I’ll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want. Jabir again says
something to someone in the room with him, returning to Paul after a
brief moment. Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You have wife? Click. The flashlight turns
on!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, I do. And a son. A young son. I want to
go home…to see them. Please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. Sir. I say that out of respect…to
you.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: 243 East Walnut Street. Hastings, Michigan.
U.S.A.</p>
<p>****: That’s my…why did you say that?</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You show blood…or they show blood.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s…you’re lying. You’re nobody…all of you.
You can’t get to them.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. You’re peasants, criminals, that’s all.
You don’t even know where Michigan is.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: Detroit. Ann Arbor. Even this basic knowledge
is enough to make Jabir’s threats that much more real.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You looked at a map. That’s all you did.</p>
<p><strong>jabir</strong>: You show blood, or they show blood. Send
video by five minutes. Jabir ends the call. Realizing that Jabir is
gone, Paul quickly dials his wife’s cell phone. After several rings, her
voice mail picks up.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.</p>
<p>****: Linda, listen to me: you and Shane have to go somewhere…
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t stay at the house, whatever you do, do
not stay at the house. The guy…the kidnapper, he knows our address. He
stole my license and now he knows where we live. Go to the Sheriff’s
station if you have to, just don’t go home. Paul hangs up. He takes a
moment to look around, noticing that the coffin is almost halfway filled
with sand.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Holy God. Paul then dials Dan Brenner. After
only one ring, the call goes directly to voice mail.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This is Daniel Brenner. Please leave a message
at the tone. The beep sounds. Paul delivers a frenzied message.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Brenner, where are you?! He’s alive! He just
called me! Call me right away! The fucking guy is still alive! Paul
hangs up the phone. Unsure what to do next, Paul’s heartbeat races. He
fidgets, nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone. He
questions the validity of Jabir’s threats toward his family.</p>
<p>****: They can’t find them. They…can’t. There’s no way. Paul opens
the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela, bound and gagged. The image
causes Paul to second guess himself. The flashlight goes out. The cell
phone’s display illuminates Paul’s face.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God. He places his hands
against the side of the coffin, spreading his fingers. He stares
intently at his thumb. With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul
slowly lowers it just above his thumb. He inhales and exhales deep
breaths, almost hyperventilating.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Holy shit. Paul then reaches into the sand and
finds one of the expired glow sticks. He shakes the sand off of it and
places it across his mouth, biting into it hard. His heart races, his
breaths are the deepest he’s ever taken. After placing the flashlight on
the ground, to ensure that the camera picks up the image, he presses the
record button on the cell phone. Grinding his teeth into the glow stick
and letting out a primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down
with the knife. We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul
sever his thumb with a swift chop of the blade.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: He’s down here!</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Get him out! Keep digging!</p>
<p><strong>voice #3</strong>: Paul, we’re here! The cacophony of voices
form a mosaic of sound in Paul’s head, each overlapping the other in
distant echoes. Shovels, digging deep into the ground, are heard banging
against the top of the coffin. The top of the coffin is torn open,
sending a brilliant ray of white light onto Paul. He stares into the
light, crying, eking out a tortured smile.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul, it’s Brenner. Paul doesn’t have the
strength to answer.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul? Are you there? Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m…here.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re coming for you now. You hear me? We know
where you are.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re coming?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We are, Paul. We’re almost there now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Coalition forces picked up a Shiite insurgent
just outside of Baghdad.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Said he knew where an American was buried
alive. He agreed to show us where if we let him go.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re coming for me?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re practically there already. An impossible
smile fights its way to Paul’s lips. His momentary joy is just that,
however, for the sand has almost completely filled the coffin by this
point.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We are.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No…you have to hurry. The sand…it’s filling up
fast.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Just hang in there for three more minutes. This
will all be over soon, I promise. Paul is very hopeful that Dan is
correct in his assumption.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. A
beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He’s visibly elated upon
seeing who it is.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Three minutes. Try to –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have to go!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul, no –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Call me right back.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Call me right back. Paul switches to the other
call, despite the fact that he has a mere eight inches left before the
entire coffin is filled with sand from top-to-bottom. He holds the
flashlight just above the top of the sand pile, allowing it to
illuminate what little unoccupied area remains.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Linda. Linda is in hysterics, which is evident
in her speech.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Paul? Paul is that you? Tell me it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s me, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh my God, Paul! What are they doing to you?
Please tell me you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m…okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I just saw the news. What…oh my God, baby.
The flashlight dims. Paul shakes it, regaining a bit of its
strength.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s going to be okay now.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I missed all your calls. I left my cell phone
at home. I just found out what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s okay. It’s all okay. They’re getting me
out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The people. Americans. They found out where I
am and they’re on their way to get me.</p>
<p>****: They are? Oh thank God. Oh dear God, thank you. The flashlight
flickers. Paul hits it. It flickers some more.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s all going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How do you know for sure? Oh God, please tell
me you’re okay. The flashlight continues to flicker almost like a
stroboscopic light from this point forward.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I was so afraid I was going to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re not. Linda breaks down in joyous
tears.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I love you so much. I love you so, so
much.</p>
<p>****: I love you, too.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. I should have listened to you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I should have never come here. You were right.
I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sweetie, I don’t care. I just want you home.
Please come home to me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Swear it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I will. I swear I will. Paul then receives a
call on the other line. He checks to see who’s calling. It’s Dan
Brenner.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re here!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The people?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re calling me right now. I have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Call me right away.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I will. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I love you. Swear it again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I swear. I have to go. Paul clicks over to the
other line, where Dan Brenner waits to speak with him. We hear Dan
yelling to people who are with him. A great deal of commotion and action
is heard through the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Move! Move! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Brenner?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Paul? Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re here! Dan yells to one of the soldiers
who are with him.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Corporal, get your men over here! Dan gets back
on the phone with Paul</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: He brought us right to you.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Start digging! Let’s go, let’s go! The
flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full
strength. Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the
very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than
ever. Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a
few inches between his face and the top of the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You have to hurry. It’s almost full.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Just hang in there!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry! Please!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Dig! Dig! Dig! Paul fights to keep his head
above the sand. The flashlight dims.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t…are you close?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re almost there, Paul. We’re almost
there!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p>****: We’re almost there. We’re right above you. The level of sand
grows even higher. Paul spits away falling sand that threatens to
suffocate him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t hear you! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We’re almost there. A SOLDIER is heard
OFF-SCREEN in the b.g. of Dan’s phone.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Keep digging!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry! Please!!!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: We see the coffin! Just hang in there!! Paul
coughs out sand. He has a mere inch left above his head.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry! Where are you? I don’t hear you? Please
hurry!!!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It’s clear!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Open it! Nondescript noise is heard through the
phone, until it comes to an abrupt stop.</p>
<p>****: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m so sorry, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s Mark White. He brought us to Mark White.
I’m – We see the circled name of “MARK WHITE” written in capital letters
on the top of the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You said…!</p>
<p>****: …I know. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No!! No!! NO!!! The battery life on Paul’s
phone runs out, causing it to power down. The filament of the flashlight
bulb burns out. As it does, the sand finally consumes the coffin,
filling it completely.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m sorry, Paul. I’m so sorry.</p>
