<h1 id="misery">misery</h1>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Still got it.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: An old friend. I was rummaging through a
closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: It’s… it’s nice, Paul. It’s got…
character.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it
around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good
book, Marcia. I was a writer then.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: You’re still a writer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I haven’t been a writer since I got into the
Misery business–</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Not a bad business. This thing would still
be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery’s Child was the most
ever–over a million.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Marcia, please.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your
daughter’s teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two
houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get?
You go and kill her.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Marcia, you know I started “Misery” on a lark.
Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle
Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to
become my life. And if I hadn’t gotten rid of her now, I’d have ended up
writing her forever. For the first time in fifteen years, I think I’m
really onto something here.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I’m glad to hear that, Paul, I really am.
But you have to know–when your fans find out that you killed off their
favorite heroine, they’re not going to say, “Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can
finally write what we’ve always wanted: An esoteric, semi-
autobiographical character study.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don’t
you know I’m scared enough? Don’t you think I remember how nobody gave a
shit about my first books? You think I’m dying to go back to shouting in
the wilderness? I’m doing this because I have to. Now, I’m leaving for
Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts–because if
I can make it work … I might just have something that I want on my
tombstone.</p>
<p><strong>paul and annie</strong>: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her
mouth down close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside
him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You hear me–Breathe! I said breathe!!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …where… am I…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shhh… we’re just outside Silver Creek.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How long…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’ve been here two days. You’re gonna be
okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I’m–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –my number one fan.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s right. I’m also a nurse. Here. Take
these.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are they…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: They’re called Novril–they’re for your
pain.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shouldn’t I be in a hospital?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The blizzard was too strong. I couldn’t risk
trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are
down.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: go to his eyelids,</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most
remarkable compassion. It does now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Open wide.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Your legs just sing grand opera when you
move, don’t they? It’s not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will I be able to walk?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course you will. And your arm will be
fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally
popped it back in there. But what I’m most proud of is the work I did on
those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don’t think
there’s a doctor who could have done any better.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s not nearly as bad as it looks. You have
a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the
left leg is fractured too. I could hear the bones moving, so it’s best
for your legs to remain immobile. And as soon as the roads open, I’ll
take you to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: In the meantime, you’ve got a lot of
recovering to do, and I consider it an honor that you’ll do it in my
home.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: This is Marcia Sindell calling from New
York City. I’d like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or the
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Which one do you want?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Whichever one’s not busy.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m pretty sure they ’re both not busy,
Ms. Sindell, since they’re both me. I also happen to be President of the
Policeman’s Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman’s Retirement
Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse;
call me Buster, everybody does, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I’m a literary agent, and I feel like a
fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be
in some kind of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the
writer?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He’s your client, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: People sure like those Misery books.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I’m sure you know Paul’s been going to the
Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Yeah, I understand he’s been up here the
last six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Not quite. I just called, and they said he
checked out five days ago. Isn’t that a little strange?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I don’t know. Does he always phone you when
he checks out of hotels?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: No, no, of course not. It’s just that his
daughter hasn’t heard from him, and when he’s got a book coming out, he
usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him…</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: You think he might be missing?</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I hate that I made this call–tell me I’m
being silly.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Just a little over-protective, maybe. Tell
you what–nothing’s been reported out here– –but I’ll put his name
through our system. And if anything turns up, I’ll call you right
away.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: G’bye, Ms. Sindell.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: We actually got a phone call. Busy
morning.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that
blizzard?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Four or five days ago. Why?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: …no reason…</p>
<p><strong>paul’s voice</strong>: I guess it was kind of a miracle… you
finding me…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, it wasn’t a miracle at all… in a way, I
was following you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Following me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, it wasn’t any secret to me that you
were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I’m your number- one fan
and all. Some nights I’d just tool on down there, sit outside and look
up at the light in your cabin– and I’d try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the world’s greatest writer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Say that last part again, I didn’t quite
hear–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t move now–wouldn’t want to hurt this
neck– Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you
were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go
for a drive when there was a big storm coming.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t know it was going to be a big
storm.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lucky for you, I did. Lucky for me too.
Because now you’re alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I’ve
read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of
them. I love them so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re very kind…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And you’re very brilliant, and you must be a
good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving
creature as Misery Chastain. Like a baby. All done.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When do you think the phone lines’ll be back
up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my
agent know I’m breathing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It shouldn’t be too much longer. Once the
roads are open, the lines’ll be up in no time. If you give me their
numbers, I’ll keep trying them for you. Could I ask you a favor? I
noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and… and I
wondered if maybe…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You want to read it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: If you wouldn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have a hard and fast rule about who can read
my stuff at this early stage–only my editor, my agent, and anyone who
saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’ll never realize what a rare treat you’ve
given me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Boy, it’s like clockwork, the way your pain
comes–I’ll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and
making you feel all oogy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s your new book called?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t have a title yet.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s crazy, but I don’t really know, I mean I
haven’t written anything but “Misery” for so long that–you read it you
can tell me what you think it’s about. Maybe you can come up with a
title.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, like I could do that?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon’s leaving,
Buster–you can tell by the champagne.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Maybe you can, Libby.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom
Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he’d pay up and be out the
door.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: No long-distance phone calls, Federal
Express packages–anything at all out of the ordinary?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: I don’t think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to
be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all,
he doesn’t have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each
time–’65 Mustang–said it helps him think. He was always a good guest,
never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to
him.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: So do I…</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: I’ll bet that old Mustang’s pulling into New
York right now.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m sure you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know I’m only forty pages into your book,
but…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, it’s ridiculous, who am I to make a
criticism to someone like you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can take it, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, it’s brilliantly written, but then
everything you write is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Pretty rough so far.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The profanity bothers you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It has no nobility.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid,
everybody talks like that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: They do not. What do you think I say when I
go to the feed store in town? “Now, Wally, give me a bag of that effing
pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow-corn”–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: –and in the bank do I tell Mrs. Bollinger,
“Here’s one big bastard of a check, give me some of your Christing
money.”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: There! Look there! See what you made me
do!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Sometimes
I get so worked up. Can you ever forgive me? Here…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I love you, Paul. Your mind. Your
creativity–that’s all I meant.</p>
<p><strong>buster and his wife virginia</strong>: Virginia is driving
while Buster intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large
thermos, pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He
begins to sip it.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: This sure is fun.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Virginia, when you’re in this car, you’re
not my wife, you’re my deputy.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Well, this deputy would rather be home
under the covers with the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Stop–stop right here.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Look at that broken branch there…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Could be the weight of the snow.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Could be–or a rotten branch or a mountain
lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Anything down there?</p>
<p><strong>buster’s voice</strong>: Yeah. An enormous amount of
snow.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: You really think Sheldon’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Hope not–if he is, he’s dead. Let’s go to
the newspaper office.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: They had it at the store, Paul, there was a
whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down.
I got the first copy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then the roads are open…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The one to town is, but that’s about it. I
called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told
him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there’s no
infection, you’re not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the
hospital is open, they’ll send an ambulance for you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The phones are working?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, mine’s still out. But the ones in town
were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked
at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page–just to read the name
Misery Chastain…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My daughter must be going nuts.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: …it’s like a visit from my oldest, dearest
friend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I was supposed to be home for her birthday
three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Your agent said she would tell her you were
okay. But I’m afraid you’ll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to
speak to her yourself.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: with almost a look</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I made you my speciality–scrambled eggs a la
Wilkes. And I’m on page 75.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess that means it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. No, it isn’t, it’s– –oh pooh, I can’t
think of any words. Would “great” be insulting?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can live with “great.”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, it’s not just great, it’s perfect, a
perfect, perfect thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m up to page 185. I always get sad when I
pass the halfway point. Will you do me a favor? I’d love it if you would
autograph my copy. I already have your autograph on a picture, but it
would mean so much to me to get it in person. I know you’re right-
handed, so don’t worry if it’s not so legible. I’ll cherish it
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t mean to pry, but I’ve read in two
magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting
jeans commercials. And I said it can’t be true. Paul Sheldon would never
waste his time with a trampy woman like that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, you can’t believe everything you read in
magazines.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I knew it. I knew it wasn’t true. Boy, how do
they get away with printing stuff like that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’d be amazed at what some people will
believe.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I thought it was time you two should meet.
Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow,
Misery.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Misery?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. I told you I was your number- one
fan.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m getting to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This farm was getting kind of dreary, what
with just the few cows and chickens and me– But when I got Misery here,
everything Changed–she just makes me smile so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s a fine… uh… pig is what she is…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: holding it tight as</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Sistine Chapel?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, that and Misery’s Child–those are the
only two divine things ever in this world…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: When my husband left me… I wasn’t prepared,
it wasn’t an easy time…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: For a while I thought I might go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know how that can be.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know about you, but what I did to get
through it was I dove into work–days, nights–night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered
Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.
’Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I just kept reading them over and over. I
know when I finish this one– and I’ve only got two chapters to go– I’ll
just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Done?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t get me wrong. I’m not against marriage
per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go
down the aisle again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, it’s not something you should enter into
lightly.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It boils down to respect. People just don’t
respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real
commitment.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’d love to stay here and chat, but I’m right
at the end and I gotta find out what happens.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, I hope you like it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course I’ll like it. Misery’s about to
have her child. What’s it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don’t tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>annie. close up</strong>: her face is ashen pale.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You…you dirty bird. She can’t be dead. Misery
Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, in 1871, women often died in
childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery’s spirit
is still alive–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I DON’T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you
MURDERED her!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No one–she just died–she slipped away, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She slipped away? She slipped away? She
didn’t just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it.
You murdered my Misery.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I thought you were good, Paul, but you’re not
good, you’re just another lying old dirty birdie and I don’t think I
better be around you for awhile. And don’t even think about anybody
coming for you, not the doctors, not your agent, not your family–because
I never called them. Nobody knows you’re here. And you better hope
nothing happens to me because if I die, you die.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: No, Ms. Sindell, there’s no point in coming
up here now. Everything that can be done is… Yes, we’re working closely
with the state police, and the FBI has been informed. Right… Right… As
soon as we know anything we’ll let you know. No, it’s no bother. Call
anytime. Bye, Ms. Sindell.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Here’s the list of all Sheldon’s credit
charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Just from his agent.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What are you doing on the floor? It’s my
fault. If I’d had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened.
Here, let me help you back in. I know this hurts, but it’ll only take a
few seconds. There you go. Comfy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re such a kidder. I have a big surprise
for you. But first there’s something you must do.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t suppose I could have a little snack
while I wait for the surprise?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll get you everything you want, but you
must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept
that. It’s why I couldn’t remember all those things they were asking me
on the witness stand in Denver.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But this time I thought clearly. I asked God
about you and God said “I delivered him unto you so that you may show
him the way.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Show me the way?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking more
along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid
the world of this filth.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You want me to burn my book?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You want me to burn my book?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know this may be difficult for you, but
it’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This isn’t difficult, my agent’s made dozens
of copies. There’s gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing
house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine.
You’re not ridding the world of anything.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Then light the match, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So you’ve indicated. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you
were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn’t make a copy,
because you didn’t think anybody would take it seriously. But they did.
And ever since you’ve never made any copies because you’re
superstitious–it’s why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge.
You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know, Annie, this book never would have
survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big
auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you’re entitled
to it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul. This isn’t about money. It’s about
decency and purity. It’s about God’s values.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re right. You’re right. I don’t know what
I was thinking. I’ll tell you what. It doesn’t have to be published.
Nobody ever has to see it. I’ll just keep it for myself. No one will
ever have to know it exists.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: As long as it does exist, your mind won’t
ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Can’t you see it’s what God wants?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re so brilliant. I would think you’d
certainly be able to see that. We’re put on this earth to help people,
Paul. Like I’m trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Please let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re doing the right thing, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Goodness!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Goodness–Goodness–Oh, my gracious–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, isn’t that an oogy mess?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: That’s the Steadman place up there. The only
other place up here is the Wilkes farm.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: ANNIE’S JEEP parked in front of her
house.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: That’s no ’65 Mustang. There’s nothing else
out this way–circle on back.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I do believe the winters are getting shorter
and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone
layer. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, well, it’s a theory. Here’s your
Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: See, isn’t this nice?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great. I’ve always wanted to visit the other
side of the room.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And look what I’ve got for you. An electric
razor so you can shave yourself now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you
could’ve gotten me to burn all my books.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Now don’t josh. This is a very big day for
you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I’ll set everything up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Set what up?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s the big surprise. Your new
studio–after all, writers do need a place to work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Work? You mean write? What in the world do you
think I’d write?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, but Paul! I don’t think, I know! Now that
you’ve gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing
what you’re great at– –you’re going to write a new novel– your greatest
achievement ever– Misery’s Return.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Misery’s Return?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know you didn’t mean it when you killed
her, and now you’ll make it right.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: CLOSE UP. In an almost religious fervor.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For
saving your life and nursing you back to health. I’ll be the first one
to read it. Oh, Paul, you’re going to make me the envy of the whole
world…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You just expect me to whip something off, that
it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I expect nothing less than your
masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You do understand that this isn’t the ordinary
way books get written– I mean, some people might actually consider this
an oddball situation.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have total confidence in your
brilliance–besides, the view will inspire you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You just inhale that. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess you don’t get bothered by neighbors
much.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t worry about that. You’ll have total
solitude so you can concentrate on your work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I got you this expensive paper to type
on.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: the paper on the</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s two of the letters in my favorite nurse’s
name, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You–fooler…! Did I do good?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You did great, except there’s just one little
thing–I can’t work with this paper. It’s Corrasable Bond, it smudges.
Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained
mimeo.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But mine cost the most so I don’t see how it
could smudge.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: sheet of paper, making</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, it does smudge after all–isn’t that
fascinating?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I thought you’d be interested. I’d like you to
be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it’s
written.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I
can get while I’m in town? Any other crucial requirements that need
satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set
of writing slippers?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, just the paper will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you sure? ’Cause if you want, I’ll bring
back the whole store for you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s the matter? I’ll tell you what’s the
matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you
happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get?
“You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can’t write on this paper, Annie.”
Well, I’ll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a
little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve written how to do this–now do it!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you know, it actually works.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Operator…</p>
<p><strong>…operator…</strong>: …Shit!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You crazy bitch…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is
plain on his face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting
from his effort. Then–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: hallway, close and</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Just the kind you asked for.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, you’re dripping with perspiration, your
color is very hectic–what have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know goddamn well what I’ve been
doing–I’VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Poor dear… Let’s get you back in bed and I’ll
get them for you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want my pills NOW!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’ll only take a second.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want my pain to go ’way, Annie– make it go
’way, please Annie– –please…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It just breaks my heart to see you like
this…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ve done a lot of thinking on the drive…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: …and I’m absolutely convinced that the main
reason I’ve never been more popular is because of my temper. You must be
so mad at me. The truth now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, I don’t hold grudges. After all, who
doesn’t let off a little steam once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My genius needs his rest before he
writes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here, in case you think of any ideas.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, well I wouldn’t expect too much.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t be silly. You’ll be brilliant. Think of
me as your inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have faith in you… …my darling…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Catch this– –ummmm-wahhhh.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Walter, we could be skipping lunch
today.</p>
<p><strong>state police chief</strong>: The presumption must now be that
Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he somehow crawled out of his car. But we
have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash. We
also know if anyone had found him, they would have taken him to an area
hospital. His body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the
snow. We’ll find him after the first thaw–unless the animals have gotten
to him first. I’ll take questions.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: You don’t think he’s dead, do you?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He might well be. But not the way they say.
He didn’t crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the
door–someone pulled him out.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: It was an old car–those dents could have
been there forever.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: There’s two kinds of people that drive
around in old cars: the ones that can’t afford new ones, and the ones
who wouldn’t give ’em up for anything in the world. That second bunch
don’t drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t be nervous– –just remember, I’ll
treasure whatever you do.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you’ll
have to do it over again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What? What happened to “I’ll treasure whatever
you do?”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, it’s not worthy of you. Throw it all
out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can
leave that in.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I really value your criticism, but maybe
you’re being a little hasty here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, what you’ve written just isn’t
fair.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –not fair?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s right–when I was growing up in
Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies
on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –cliff-hangers–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know that, Mister Man–they also call them
serials. I’m not stupid, you know. Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man,
and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on
a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore
out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to
steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could
escape and it crashed and burned and–I was so upset and excited and the
next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start
with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get
out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped
free and all the kids cheered– –but I didn’t cheer, I stood right up and
started shouting, “This isn’t what happened last week–have you all got
amnesia?–THEY JUST CHEATED</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie.
Shouting:</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They always cheated like that in cliff–
–chapter plays.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember,
Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse
fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay
there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there
couldn’t have been any “experimental blood transfusion” that saved her
life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you’ll have
to start there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look at this, I’ve got Lizzie Borden for an
editor, here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s the matter, Paul? You haven’t written
a word.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t write this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t be silly. Of course you can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m telling you, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You can–you have the “gotta”–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The “gotta.” Remember, you talked about it in
Playboy magazine. You said there’s a million things you can’t do in this
world; you can’t hit a curve ball, you can’t fix a leaky faucet or make
a marriage work– but there’s one thing you always have, and that’s the
power of the “gotta.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I said that?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You said you can make it so they gotta turn
the page. You know, “I ‘gotta’ know will she live,” “I ‘gotta’ know will
he catch the killer.” “I gotta see how this chapter ends.” You said it.
I don’t usually buy that magazine. I only got it, ’cause they were
interviewing you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: CLOSE UP. Blinking.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about a bee…?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that
the reason they’d buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put
her in that temporary coma–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: –and when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how
thirty years earlier, the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde–
–and then old Dr. Cleary deduced that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde’s
long-lost daughter because of the rarity of deadly bee-stings–my heart
just leapt.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ve known from the very first book that
Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you
finish? I can fill in the “n”s. Will she be her old self, now that Ian
has dug her out, or will she have amnesia…?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Will she still love him with that special
perfect love?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Not even a hint?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Misery’s alive! Misery’s alive. Oh, it’s so
romantic–this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I’m going
to put on my Liberace records– –you do like Liberace, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Whenever he played Radio City, who do you
think was right there in the front row?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m going to play my records all day</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: –to inspire you–he’s my all-time favorite.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Would you have dinner with me tonight?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To celebrate Misery’s return. I couldn’t have
done it without you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No, he’s not here. I don’t know where he
went. He never tells me anything anymore. He’s probably out having an
affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I think I hear him coming.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: It’s Jim Taylor. He wants to know who
you’ve been having an affair with.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Hey, Jim, what’s doing? Uh-huh… uh- huh…
Jim, we’ve been over this. If you’re gonna have benches in front of your
store, people are gonna sit on them. I don’t like him either, but I’m
not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to
Denise. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: books; all paperback</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Virginia, I’m flattered you think I got that
much energy. I just figured if I can’t find Paul Sheldon, at least I can
find out what he wrote about.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What do you expect to find? A story about
a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Now, you see, it’s that kind of sarcasm
that’s given our marriage real spice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I hope you like it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It looks wonderful. And so do you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve never had meatloaf this good, what do you
do to it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never
canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with
the ground beef.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh. You can’t get this in a restaurant in New
York.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, I think we should have a toast.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: A toast?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more
wine.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: To Misery.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait, let’s do this right. Do you have any
candles?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I think so. I’ll go
look.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you study decorating, or do you just have
a flair?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, you. I just picked things up over the
years.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, it certainly says you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Absolutely. Listen, if you can’t find any,
it’s okay. I just thought it might be nice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that
one day I’d be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own
house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled.
Will this do?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who brought her
back to life.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul, every time I think about it, I get
goosebumps.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, God, what have I done? I’m so sorry,
Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let
me pour another one. Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To Misery.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, this is positively the best Misery
you’ve ever written.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think it’s so wonderful that Misery would
sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people. That’s true
nobility.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here’s your pills.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: turns back, gestures</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it’s as if she’s been
turned off, gone lifeless.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: When you first came here, I only loved the
writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too.
As much as Misery loves Ian. I know you don’t love me–don’t say you
do–you’re a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I’m…not a
movie star type. You’ll never know the fear of losing someone like you
if you’re someone like me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why would you lose me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The book is almost finished. Your legs are
getting better. Soon you’ll be able to walk. You’ll be wanting to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why would I want to leave? I like it here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s very kind of you, but I’ll bet it’s
not altogether true.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have this gun, and sometimes I think about
using it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I better go now. I might put bullets in
it.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: “There is a justice higher than that of man.
I will be judged by Him.”</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: They’re hauling Misery into court.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: “There is a justice higher than that of
man–I will be judged by Him.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: PAUL–eyes closed. There is another loud
THUNDERCLAP which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, I know you’ve been out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’ve been out of your room.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study
always faces due south.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Is this what you’re looking for? I know
you’ve been out twice, Paul. At first, I couldn’t figure out how you did
it, but last night I found your key. I know I left my scrapbook out, and
I can imagine what you might be thinking of me. But you see, Paul, it’s
all okay.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Last night it came so clear. I realize you
just need more time. Eventually, you’ll come to accept the idea of being
here. Paul, do you know about the early days at the Kimberly Diamond
Mine? Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole
diamonds? Don’t worry, they didn’t kill them. That would be like junking
a Mercedes just because it had a broken spring– no, if they caught them
they had to make sure they could go on working, but they also had to
make sure they could never run away. The operation was called
hobbling.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, whatever you’re thinking about, don’t
do it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Now don’t fuss, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why would I run away? I’m a writer, Annie–it’s
all I am–and I’ve never written this well–even you said that this is my
best, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Didn’t you? Why would I leave a place where
I’m doing my best work? It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shh, darling, trust me– It’s for the
best.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie, for God’s sake, please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: CLOSE UP, shrieking.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Almost done, just one more.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: God, I love you…</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Just leave it, all right?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Oh, I like that tone.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: How many times do I have to tell you– I have
a system here. Where the hell is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: That thing. Here it is. Right where it’s
supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m not sure. Maybe nothing.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: It’s good you found it.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: There’s that spice again.</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: “Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse
steps, ‘There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged by
Him.’”</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, Punkin.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Give us a smile? Such a kidder.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Hey, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Buster.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Answer me a couple things?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: If I can.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon
books?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We had a batch. Sold ’em all in three
days.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to remember if Miz
Wilkes bought one, would you?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes
a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Has she been buying any odd things
lately?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. –Lest you call
paper odd.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Newspapers?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No, the typing kind.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, don’t you think it’s time for you to
start writing again? It’s been over a week.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know, it’s weird, but a couple of
broken bones hasn’t done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t talk to me like that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take
your best shot.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why are you so mean, Mister you’d-be-
dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn’t-for- me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make
me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland
if you’re not nicer–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t think I’ll ever understand you. I
cook your meals, I tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day, and
you continue to fight me. When are we going to develop a sense of
trust?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, my!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you. You
didn’t give me a chance to knock.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Guess you can tell from my reaction, I’m not
all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I was just wondering if you happen to know
anything about Paul Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Anything you can tell me might help.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, the only child of Franklin and
Helene Sheldon, mediocre student, majored in history…</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Excuse me, that’s not exactly the kind of
information I was after. You see, he’s been missing for quite some time
now, and…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know. It’s so upsetting. I’m his number-one
fan…I’ve got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I’m so
proud of my Paul Sheldon collection… …here I am, prattling on and my
manners have just flown away. I haven’t invited you in. Please.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: ’Course you must know about that horrible
accident.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Almost killed me, too. I prayed when I heard
the news. I got down on my knees and begged for it not to be true.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re going to laugh at what I’m about to
say, but go ahead, I don’t care… …when I was praying, God told me to get
ready.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Get ready for what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: To try and be his replacement–he gave so much
pleasure to so many people and there’s a shortage of pleasure on this
planet these days, in case you hadn’t noticed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: God told me, since I was his number- one fan,
that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to
town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind
Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio.
Would you like to see it?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s right this way.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s right here. I knew how he wrote, the
kinds of words he used, the wonderful stories he told– –I’ve spent the
last four weeks trying to write like Paul Sheldon. But I can’t do it
right. I try and I try and I know all the words– –but it’s just not the
same.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Well… …maybe it takes time to get the hang
of it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I could give you a couple of hundred pages of
mine, and you could tell me what you think.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m not much of a critic.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I just thought–oh, look at me. You’d
think I’d never had a house guest before. Would you like something to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: There’s some already made.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Must get lonely, living out here all by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I always say if you can’t enjoy your own
company, you’re not fit company for anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: You got a point there…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don’t want to take
up any more of your time. I best be going.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But you didn’t even taste your cocoa.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m sure it’s wonderful, but really should
be getting back.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: If you don’t mind, perhaps I could pay you
another visit sometime.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’d be delighted. Now that you know the
way…</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Miz Wilkes, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Miz Wilkes?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here. I’m down here. Down here.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Mr. Sheldon?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t feel bad, Paul. It had to happen. I’ve
been waiting for this sign.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ve known for some time why I was chosen to
save you. You and I were meant to be together forever. But now our time
in this world must end. But don’t worry, Paul. I’ve already prepared for
what must be done. I put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for
me. Oh, darling, it will be so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Now don’t be afraid. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know you do. I love you too, Annie. And
you’re right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But
it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery
eternal life. We must finish the book.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But the time is now. Soon others will
come.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s almost done. By dawn we’ll be able to
give Misery back to the world.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here, Paul. I’ll fix you something to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul. It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Three more chapters to go.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The stranger staying at the Inn, is he
someone from Misery’s past?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This is so exciting. It’s Windthorne, her
first love, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh you!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It WAS Windthorne. I knew it–what does that
do to her love for Ian?– –of course, if she hadn’t thought Windthorne
was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first
place. Sorry, it’s just that this is so wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m glad you like it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, this will be our legacy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It will.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul. I’m dying. Does she wind up with
Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll know very soon. I’m starting the last
chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I’ll
require three things.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette,
because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book,
and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one
glass of champagne. Dome Pear-igg-non.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dome Pear-igg-non it is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Annie! Annie!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m almost done.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and
Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery’s hand. Does Ian win? Oh,
don’t me. It’s Windthorne, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll know everything in a minute. Get the
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ahh!!!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Did I do good?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You did perfect. Except for one thing. This
time we need two glasses.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s all right here, Annie. Remember how for
all those years no one ever knew who Misery’s real father was, or if
they’d ever be reunited? It’s all right here. Will Misery finally lead
her countrymen to freedom? Does she finally marry Ian or will it be
Windthorne? It’s all right here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why not? I learned it from you…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no, NOT MISERY–NOT MY MISERY…!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m going to kill you, you lying
cocksucker…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here. Here. You want it? You want it? You can
eat it–eat it–eat it till you fucking CHOKE–you sick, twisted fuck.</p>
<p><strong>younger cop</strong>: It’s the writer–the dead one–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –right! I’m the dead one–</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Where’s Sheriff McCain?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s in the cellar. She killed him.</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Annie Wilkes?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. She’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Mr. Sheldon? There’s no one in there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: CLOSE UP. In shock.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry I’m late. Jenny’s basketball game went
into overtime. If anybody ever told me I’d have a daughter who’d get a
triple double, I’d…</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Did they win?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. They’re in the semis.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Here it is. Very first copy.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: The word I’m getting is the Times review is
gonna be a love letter.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’d be a first.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell
me they’re both raves. And don’t laugh–for the first time, I think
you’ve got a shot at some prizes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I thought you’d be thrilled. You’re being
taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m delighted the critics are liking it, and I
hope the people like it, too. But it’s not why I wrote the book.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace
about him. He has been through the fire and survived.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I like it. Remember how you once said I live
my whole life as if I’m in danger of being found out? Well, I believe
I’ve managed to get that guy down on paper. Don’t think I’m completely
nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped
me.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Paul, since you brought her up, I have to
ask you this, or I’d be drummed out of the agents’ union– what about a
non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gee, Marcia, if I didn’t know you better, I’d
think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just
so we could make a few bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: Now you’ve hurt me, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>sindell</strong>: I thought you were over it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I am. Well, maybe not completely–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know if you can ever be totally over
something like that–I just don’t think about it as much anymore, and
when I do, it’s not so terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I mean, once they found her body, my
nightmares stopped.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Would you care for anything?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cut me something sinful…</p>
