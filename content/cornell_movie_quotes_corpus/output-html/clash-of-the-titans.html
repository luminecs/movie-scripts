<h1 id="clash-of-the-titans">clash-of-the-titans</h1>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: as the Dog traverses a landscape of
– BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was furious,
hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and nightmare CREATURES,
their corpses now in piles to the horizon. The Dog climbs a mound of
casualties. At the top, the Dog looks back across the battlefield. The
Dog’s eyes are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: Now we end the debate about tactics…
and begin to plan for victory.</p>
<p><strong>at the back of the hall</strong>: The Dog stares at the King.
Then slips away.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch
from the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of
QUEEN DANAE as a LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen’s
perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting leaves. The
Dog’s eyes. He moves forward.</p>
<p><strong>floor-level</strong>: TRACKING WITH the Dog’s legs as they
MORPH INTO HUMAN LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
who roughly pulls a curtain aside. In the bed, the Queen is startled,
then pleased.</p>
<p><strong>queen danae</strong>: My King! Has the strategy been set so
quickly?</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: The looming figure looks exactly like
King Acrisius, including the distinctive scar. He regards her
hungrily.</p>
<p><strong>queen danae</strong>: Come to your Queen, my King.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On the wall above is the huge shadow of
a four-legged creature – and now it appears: The Dog stops at the top of
the stairs and regards the men without fear – its eyes blaze with a
God’s power. Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
raise their weapons. The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and
passes close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the shadows
below.</p>
<p><strong>hardened countenance - day</strong>: staring at –</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and
weeping. Her arms are bound. A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women
weep, the men agonize. Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and
chain it closed. On the King’s signal, the Guards carry the chest to the
edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a SCREAM from within. Some
members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at their King, outraged
by this double murder. Acrisius registers their disapproving looks and
angrily turns to leave the promontory. WE SEE in his face what the
others do not – shame and doubt. IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights
itself and rides out on the tide.</p>
<p>****: My own subjects condemn me! They dare judge me? And what
emboldens this treachery?…</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: You are mistaken, my King. None would risk
your anger –</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: It is Zeus who warps my kinadom!…
Zeus the ungodly, Zeus the defiler… This talk sobers the Steward
instantly; he looks about fearlessly.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Please, speak not these things – Acrisius
spins on him, out of control –</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes my
precious Queen! This is a low, conniving God… But I have bested him on
this day and humbled the great Prime.</p>
<p>****: Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on Olympos? Who does the
Fearless One fear?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: I beg you, Your Highness – Acrisius pulls a
dagger and holds it to the Steward’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: Tell me what the Priests say!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Tiamat… Tiamat, Queen of the Deep.</p>
<p>****: Those who dare, whisper she covets Zeus’ throne and schemes to
achieve it, the ambitious Goddess of the Dark Oceans…</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: Yes, Tiamat! And today I have honored
her. The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: I’ve taken Zeus’ whore and the
bastard she grows in her belly and thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
sea!</p>
<p>****: I honor Zeus’ rival with all that was dear to me – – and commit
double murder in her honor… About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again
–</p>
<p><strong>king acrisius</strong>: so that Zeus will know I despise and
disdain him and spit on his foul name! The Steward shrinks from this
blasphemy, eyes darting in fear. ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in
the moonlight, arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly –
– his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking his being. A
HORRIBLE SOUND and THE KING’S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN</p>
<p><strong>misshapen disfigurement.</strong>: And thus, KING ACRISIUS
BECOMES… KALIBOS! The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR
and the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He SCREAMS, but
it’s too late – the huge CREATURE grabs him by the neck and LIFTS HIM
OUT OF FRAME. From the empty, moonlit dunes, we…</p>
<p><strong>form –</strong>: – in an instant, the apparition blows past
them – wind and dust whip at them. In awe and fear –</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Thoth the Quick…</p>
<p>****: Messenger of the Gods. Bound for Olympos. The rushing Black
Form crosses a field, leaving a violent wave in the long grass and
suddenly –</p>
<p><strong>we are in that rushing pov</strong>: the landscape is just a
blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP TO the summit – –
INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist – villas, classical
facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The polished stone of the grandest villa
reflects THOTH’S dark form touching down.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: My lord.</p>
<p>****: We have debated, we have voted, and it is decided. We offer the
Humans peace. Thoth, you will take them the terms of a treaty –</p>
<p>****: A treaty! Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God’s eyes
are familiar – the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog. In the shadowed
corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose
countenance is death made visible, and – – TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP,
the only God fearless enough to challenge Zeus’ rule –</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: We don’t negotiate with them! We dictate to
them. Their place is to beg. They have forgotten their role and have
denied us the sustenance of their prayers.</p>
<p><strong>aphrodite</strong>: Our mercy will give them reason to be
grateful. They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion
than before.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: They will bow down when we snap their backs!
Mercy? We are Gods! Some of us remember that and are not afraid – Zeus
has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to the walls, the eagle
beats its wings in rage.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Silence! Or learn what it is to be afraid! The
debate is over, the votes cast… Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears
TEN chips of alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: We guarantee an armistice, we shield the
bridegroom and the Joppan royal family.</p>
<p>****: And we do not interfere in their actions. We leave them
undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: And if they refuse our terms?</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: They have suffered terrible losses. They will
not pass up a chance for peace.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: This is your rightful place to take.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown weaker than
I knew. Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the
two black shards representing their votes. He hands one to Tiamat.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: So have they all. They no longer see
clearly.</p>
<p>****: They’re beginning to think like Men. But you and I shall not.
Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: We will manage these thick-witted Humans to
our own ends. Yes, we will be bound by great Zeus’ rules… until their
fragile membranes tear. We dare not interfere with these insects…</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: but we may be invited to intervene. Tiamat
flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool – the whole pool darkens
and choppy waves crash over the sides… a tiny tempest.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: joppa, capital of the dominion of
illyria</strong>: Suddenly the market falls SILENT. Fear grips the
crowd. An occurrence rare in the world of Men – AN OLYMPIAN</p>
<p><strong>approaches.</strong>: The clouds stop dead. The crowd stops.
TIME STOPS. A PRESENCE WE DO NOT SEE moves to the BASILICA, the royal
residence and assembly hall.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: The emissary approaches. Take your time in
your responses, debate nothing…</p>
<p>****: I’ve received ambassadors before.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: None like this.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: I’m not cowed. If these arrogant Gods are
so powerful, why are they the ones seeking a truce?</p>
<p>****: I only recommend you take care with the tone of the
conversation. A truce would benefit all…</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: In my palace, I decide how the discourse
proceeds, not some messenger sent on errands by Zeus.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: You are correct, Your Highness, I do the
bidding of Zeus… To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see – Thoth the Quick,
Messenger of the Gods, float forward.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: … as do all Gods… and all men. Thoth removes
his hood, revealing his crystal skull.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: King Kepheus, as humble messenger of Zeus,
I’ve come to talk of peace.</p>
<p>****: Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the King’s Magi Strategos. We
welcome you with humility, honored by your visit from the realm of the
Gods. The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by Thoth’s
sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover her composure.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: I am a reasonable man. Everyone wishes for
the conflict to cease.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: Zeus above all. He has so long desired the
tragedy end, he made a plan that began twenty-five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: Twenty-five years! How is that possible?
Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her way. Icy –</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: Beauteous Queen, let Thoth limn for you the
forethought and wisdom of Zeus, God of Gods.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: A treaty marriage?</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: You have a daughter of age.</p>
<p>****: Andromeda!</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal father to
give his daughter to a God.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: No. Such a union would be unclean. Years ago
Zeus created a scion of mixed blood. Half-man, half-God. Bred for just
this union. That is how important Zeus considers this truce.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: Is my only daughter to marry a demigod,
not of this earth?</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: A prince, of both Olympian and Human royalty.
A chosen one.</p>
<p><strong>thoth</strong>: Zeus has given his son to the cause of
peace.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: I have heard of no such demigod.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Majesty, if I may – the young man does exist.
He lives in a small fishing village on the isle of Seriphos. Kepheus
turns, surprised at Amoun’s foreknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: You knew about this and said nothing?</p>
<p>****: Just which king do you serve?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: My Queen, I serve only the great order of
things. I was the boy’s tutor years ago.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: How haughty this boy must be, who knows he
is half-God.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: He knows nothing and believes himself an
ordinary man. He has never left his village. He can be overconfident,
but it is from inexperience, not arrogance. Repheus and Cassiopeia
exchange wary looks. Sharply</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: What assurance do we have that our
daughter will be safe?</p>
<p>****: You have my word, as Ambassador of the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: With our daughter’s future at stake, we do
not bestow trust easily.</p>
<p>****: If any harm should come to her –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Amoun reacts, but it is too late – Thoth
has been</p>
<p><strong>irritated:</strong>: Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing
with an AWFUL SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for a
solid handhold, frightened. The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from
their pits and pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
Thoth.</p>
<p>****: The Princessa shall not be harmed.</p>
<p>****: Your Majesty…</p>
<p>****: Of course… of course your word is unquestioned here. Thoth’s
demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the table, rolling across the
floor to Kepheus’ feet. TILT UP TO his intimidated face:</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Where is the lucky young suitor?</p>
<p><strong>at –</strong>: PERSEUS, 25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a
stubbled jaw, a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace of
a porpoise – beyond the ability of any normal man.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his
knife to cut the net near the shark’s snout. The shark tries to swim
through the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus hangs on.
One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net, bumping the young
hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls Anteros toward the surface.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Your grieving does Anteros no good. It
comforts only you.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: It’s my fault he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: He was careless with the net. Perseus gives
him a hard look.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: So it’s his fault. Not mine, not fate, not
the Gods?</p>
<p>****: The Gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy
while we act. We make our own history.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Now my history is I let my friend die in my
arms. I made it back, why couldn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: What you do, no other man can do. Have you
not noticed?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: To what purpose? I failed him.</p>
<p>****: Purpose! Looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the
superstition of the Gods, as surely as your friend was caught in that
net. And all the searching leads down to the same place. The trawler is
approaching its home island, Seriphos. Perseus looks off at the rocky
coast. Collects himself,</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You always say that my abilities are
greater than other men’s. But they were not enough to save him.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: You are still a man, confined by man’s
limits. You are just as likely to fail as succeed.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: How is that greater than other men?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Ordinary men fail most of the time. The
trawler rounds a point on the island. Perseus spies a beautiful girl on
the cliff. A closer</p>
<p><strong>look –</strong>: A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her
lithe figure. Flowers in her golden hair – wilted dahlias. Young yet
ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She watches Perseus intently as the boat
passes. He turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but no
one has. When he looks back, she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>tekla</strong>: Mother wants you to come in for supper.</p>
<p>****: Perseus, why are you so sad? This breaks his spell. He looks at
Tekla warmly, gets up and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as
they head inside.</p>
<p><strong>tekla</strong>: I still don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Your mother can explain. She believes
everything has an explanation, even if we have to make it up.</p>
<p>****: It’s one of the reasons I love you, Marmara.</p>
<p><strong>tekla</strong>: Tell me! Why is there war between Man and the
Gods? Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.</p>
<p><strong>marmara</strong>: At the beginning of time, when Man was
young, he prayed to the Gods. His belief in the Gods gave his life
meaning. It was a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: If you consider superstition, fear and
darkness good things…</p>
<p>****: But Man grew, as children do, and he turned away from the Gods.
Be began to put his faith in other things. Perseus watches the debate
with fiery eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tekla</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Learning, science… love.</p>
<p>****: self-determination! Those things that give Man dignity and
independence.</p>
<p><strong>marmara</strong>: But what of the Gods, who had protected and
guided us so long? They must breathe our prayers to survive. They hunger
for</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: – as lions hunger for blood.</p>
<p><strong>marmara</strong>: Spyros!</p>
<p>****: Your father’s mind is closed on these matters.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: The Gods were desperate to claim our awe
again.</p>
<p><strong>tekla</strong>: Desperate… the Gods?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Yes, even the Gods. If they could not earn
our faith with love, they would demand it with fear. Whatever was
necessary to ensure L their continued existence.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>marmara</strong>: And that is how war broke out between Man
and Gods.</p>
<p>****: Now eat your dinner, which the Gods – and your father – have
provided.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You… I saw you watching our boat at the
cliff.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: It was not the boat I was
watching.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Can I be of service?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Yes, of service. I need you to come
with me on a journey. Perseus gives her a look.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Right now? It wouldn’t take much persuading
to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible. My family
can’t wake and find me gone. Where do you want me to go?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: It’s not what I want. I am in the
service of others.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus can’t get over her beauty, the
dulcet sound of her voice. Even so –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Come back in the morning and we can talk
about it.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: For what? Perseus doesn’t notice the black
widow spider scurry between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then
a swarm, racing toward him. He feels the first spider and looks down.
The creatures climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and falls.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ woozy pov</strong>: The Wilting Girl standing
placidly in the doorway watching him.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He blacks out.</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: We SEE that she is also watching Perseus,
who is sleeping in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are bite marks on
his legs and arms, but they seem to be healing as we look at them.
Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting Girl.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: How long have I been out?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: This time? Only a few hours. The time
before, almost a day. How was your rest?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I had a dream. I fell into a dark pit. I
thought I would never stop falling. But a beam of light formed a soft
net, caught me and tossed me back. TheWilting Girl watches him.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: When I came back up to the world, a
beautiful woman appeared and spoke to me. But as she spoke she would
sometimes disappear into the whiteness with a strange sound.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ pov</strong>: The Wilting Girl listens to his
story.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: When I could hear her, she spoke nonsense.
She said that my father was a God and my mother a – At that moment the
blinding-white sail swings between them as she tacks, obscuring his view
of her for a moment. The wind makes a LOUD SNAPPING SOUND in the cloth.
Then she reappears, the sail on her other side.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ face</strong>: as he realizes she is his vision.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: You are special, Perseus. Your birth
was ordained for this very purpose.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I am an ordinary man.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Do you ever lie awake during a storm
and listen to the thunder?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: And it sounds as though it matches the
beating of your heart? He doesn’t have to answer; it’s written on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: How long can you hold your breath?
Longer than the others? Are there times when you know you should feel
pain, but you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: None of that means anything.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Look at your arms, Perseus. Perseus
watches the bites on his arm heal visibly.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: A good trick. You must be the demigod, not
me.</p>
<p>****: I’m a Chthonian.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: A Chthonian?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: An Earth Goddess.</p>
<p>****: The Gods have a caste system just as men do. The Olympians are
our nobility – few but cosmic. The Chthonians are the peasants. Our
abode is this earth, and we exist as long as men worship us.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: And when none worship you? Sadness flickers
through her extraordinary eyes.</p>
<p>****: We fade away. This touches Perseus deeply. His tone
changes.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: And demigods, where do they stand in your
hierarchy?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Nowhere. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: If demigods rank so low, why do you need
me?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: For a marriage.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a
treaty to end the war. At the center is the marriage of a mortal with a
demigod.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Who, me?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Zeus himself has chosen you. A demigod
may be less than a God, but he’s more than a Man. One foot in Humanity,
the other in Divinity. Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between
our races.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Such a union could save millions of
souls. Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: And just who exactly am I supposed to
marry?</p>
<p><strong>closeup</strong>: A hot embrace. In the blur of movement our
first good look is at the GIRL, a beauty – PRINCESSA</p>
<p><strong>andromeda, 18.</strong>: The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper
– ripped and sexy. It’s hard to tell who’s the aggressor here. Gasping,
Andromeda holds him at bay –</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Do you think you can manhandle a Princess
this way? As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant?
Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: very mistaken… a woman of my station…
never be attracted… They go at it again.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Princess… Princess!</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: The Princess is not here.</p>
<p>****: Find another… Princess.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: The Queen approaches!</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Andromeda! You’ll care enough if you’re
caught! Remember last time… From inside we HEAR complaining, more
kissing and moaning.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: Peshet! Startled, Peshet spins to see
the Queen approach.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: Where is the Princess?</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Is she not in her chambers, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: She is not. You are expected to know her
– A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia. She throws a
perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks guilty.</p>
<p>****: Tell the Princess – should you find her – her father and I want
to see her at once. She stalks away. Urgently, through the door –</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Princess, it’s the King as well!</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: To please you, I would submit to such a
marriage… except I would rather die; Please let me know you’re serious
about this perverse plan so I can make arrangements to kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She stomps out. Their gaze follows until
she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: It will take more than half-a-God to handle
her.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: She’ll be a great ruler one day.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: You’re looking in the wrong
direction.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Perhaps you should give some thought
to your immediate future.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: That’s what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Maybe you should take another look…
She indicates the view behind him. Perseus turns, jaw dropping.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: A breathtaking view of Joppa – a city in
two parts. At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
working-class area – the LOWER WHARF. Above, twisting stone stairs climb
the cliffs to the ACROPOLIS with its gleaming villas, temples, statues,
and colonnaded towers, hugging the precipice.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through
the city. He’s never seen anything like it. He rubbernecks, awestruck as
he passes a BLACKSMITH who takes a dragon skin from the coals and
fashions armor by pounding the white-hot scales over a mold.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: All the goods, armies, and culture of
Man’s dominion flow through this port. He who reigns in Joppa, rules the
world. Amidst the exotic chaos, Perseus is struck by the homeless
refugees on the street and the ruins of once- proud buildings.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: The war has badly scarred this place.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: It is the war you have the power to
end. He throws her an angry look, grim.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Don’t joke about such things. I’d be
useless before such a huge responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Perhaps you would be…</p>
<p>****: … as you are now. They pass an evangelist haranguing a
crowd.</p>
<p>****: – one true God is not Zeus but she called the Deep –
Tiamat!</p>
<p>****: ‘Before the first dawn, the eyes of the Deep watched the
earth.’ Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos or know despair, for Tiamat
will rule the heavens and the earth. Perseus is mystified by this talk.
He turns to Vidalia for explanation, but she seems disturbed by the
preacher L and does not return Perseus’ gaze.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and
see the regal Basilica. WORKMEN hang banners and decorations, preparing
for a big event.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What are they celebrating?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: . before I am a king or a peacemaker, I am
a father. Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m not sure, Your Highness. I did not know
my father.</p>
<p>****: Yes, well… it means I had no desire for my little girl’s
carefree springtime to be cut</p>
<p>****: What is she?</p>
<p>****: I’m sure she’s preparing herself to make the best possible
impression. Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple.
Kepheus paces with mounting impatience.</p>
<p>****: – and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict… of
which she knows nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: She’s not the only one, sir. I don’t know
much about the events for which I’ve been drafted.</p>
<p>****: I take no comfort in that, young man. In fact, I find little to
take comfort in here. You are a stranger from a distant place, and I am
asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you.</p>
<p>****: If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any
kind should come her way, I will have your head on a stake. Kepheus
thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus’ face. He puts his hand on the hilt of
his sword.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Is this amusing to you?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Not even a little, my lord. It’s just that
I myself was waylaid – snatched also, as you say, from my happy
springtime… Kepheus studies him to see if he’s making jest of him.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’ve been told I’m to play a part in events
which serve a higher purpose… of which I’m not at all convinced.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Does a truce in the war between Men and
Gods not strike you as a higher purpose?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: With all respect, I have never seen a God.
On my island, they’re no more than a story.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: You will learn there is more to this
universe than is found on your island.</p>
<p>****: This is supposed to be the son of a God, yet he doubts their
existence!</p>
<p>****: They exist, young man. But if you doubt their power, I join you
–</p>
<p>****: Cassiopeia! We have agreed such talk has no place in this
palace.</p>
<p>****: Have we?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I can only proceed based on what I have
experienced, not on a faith I do not possess.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Where does a young person get such
ideas?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Perhaps from my adopted father, sir. I
admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Is he a scholar?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: No, Your Highness, a fisherman.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: I know this mentor who so influences young
Perseus. Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts in
amazement.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Master Amoun! He hurries over to the older
man, who embraces him warmly.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Porpoise… You’ve grown tall and strong since
my departure. Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at
arm’s length.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: I am honored to serve the King as an advisor.
His Magi Strategos.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: From my village tutor to Magi Strategos…
What a path! The King’s patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Where is Andromeda? At the least, the two
should meet before tomorrow’s ceremony…</p>
<p>****: Tomorrow? Is the wedding so soon?</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: The wedding comes later. Tomorrow we
will have the public announcement.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: And a celebration of the treaty. A Page
enters and whispers in Kepheus’ ear. Kepheus is irritated.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: It seems our Andromeda has wandered away.
Cassiopeia reacts, upset.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Perhaps the thought of her new life has made
her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Perseus, if you’re to take the wild girl
for a wife, this is a good time to start your training. Go into the city
and retrieve her.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: How will I know her?</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: She is unmistakable.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m a stranger here. Any hints?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Follow the lights and the sound of profane
music.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: Zeus? Zeus’ rumbling voice is held
low, talking to her in an intimate way – a beautiful sound.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Why do we have to play these games, my lovely
girl? You know you cannot leave. The vines retract, freeing her. She
rubs where they gripped her.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: My part is finished.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: It has just begun. Have you forgotten your
place in this?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: As I’ve lost my believers, the future
has become dimmer to me.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: I still believe in you. Close your eyes and
see your tomorrow. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: It’s too painful. I can’t involve
myself.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: You you already involved. Such is fate. We
cannot hide from the .trials of our future… no matter how dark the
alleyway. She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Andromeda is dancing at the center of
attention, her sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane. A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN
embraces her. She gives him a deep kiss, causing a sensation, then
breaks away into the crush.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Very beautiful. Andromeda spins,
petulant.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Will you please give me some</p>
<p><strong>peace –</strong>: The sight of the handsome stranger gives
her pause.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I said, ‘Very beautiful.’</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Do you think just anyone can make
intimate judgements on the royal family?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I meant the sunset. She regards Perseus
over her glistening bare shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Do you always start a seduction with an
insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I know nothing of seduction. I’m a simple
fisherman. My home is across that water.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: To Joppa? I was kidnapped.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I mean here, tonight. He looks over at
her a long moment.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’ve come to see my future wife. Startled,
Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad mix of emotions crosses her
face.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: It’s not personal. You’re not a
bad-looking boy. I’m too young. I don’t want to be married.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Then why are you doing it?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: No one asked me. And now that I’ve met you,
I don’t know if I can go through with it. It’s not personal. Seeing you
makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won’t be
the pawn of a King or a God. She looks at him with new interest.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Since we agree, it’s settled. No
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I don’t think it’s going to be that simple.
Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: That doesn’t mean we can’t be friends.
Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into
a tall, hedged garden maze.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m already lost.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I’ll take care of you. They take two more
jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been
stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: This is my special place. No one can see
or hear or even find us now.</p>
<p>****: I don’t suppose I could escape without your aid.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Do you want to? When he turns back to
her, she melts into his arms and gives him a long deep kiss. He’s
surprised, but handles it well. When she tries to continue, he slows
things down, holding her at bay.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Do you not find me attractive?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: One of the most beautiful women I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Of course, you haven’t been much in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: True. Maybe a lot of girls look like
you.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Don’t you want to make love to your
almost-wife? Maybe we’ll find we’re not compatible.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What if we find we’re very compat– She
stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender to his desire, but
again, he stops. Her voice is a low</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Is it true you’re a demigod?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: It seems what everyone wants to believe.
Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I don’t see it. But let’s find out for
sure… She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of foliage.
He can no longer resist. Together they fall into the softness. He kisses
her passionately as their bodies begin to move together. She breaks the
kiss for only a moment, her voice husky –</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I think I’m becoming a believer… They
start to make love.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: Tiamat, I know this place, but I know not
why.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: In this chamber Zeus defiled the Queen Danae
and begat the anointed demigod, who would facilitate this foul
truce.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: Ah, the former palace of the cursed
Acrisius.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: The King who stood against Zeus and was
crushed for it, though he was not the offender. But this is not his
former home…</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: still he dwells in rancid hate, having
killed his generals and sucked their bones. We cannot break the rules of
Zeus and interfere with the humans. But this poor creature can do our
work and visit the would-be groom.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: What form of monster do you visit upon Perseus?
There is an awful SOUND from the darkness of an archway.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: What form, dear Set? Why this… In the
half-light appears the huge, deformed changeling:</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: My Servant, your lonely solitude now ends…
It’s time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I didn’t know how to get this outfit
on.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I want to thank you for seeing me home. I
was so flushed with wine I can’t recall much of the evening. Perseus
half smiles and turns to the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ pov - the wilting girl</strong>: watches from the
back of the hall. When they make eye contact, she quickly looks
away.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Perseus is surprised by his feelings.
Andromeda has seen her, too. He has a guilty moment and averts his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: At what point do you plan to tell them
we’re not getting married?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell who?</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Them…</p>
<p><strong>from behind them</strong>: We see the ecstatic crowd of
thousands, all celebrating the union. MUSIC STOPS and the crowd begins
to settle.</p>
<p><strong>royal herald</strong>: The Queen will speak! The room QUIETS
as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of the dais with a cup of wine, not
her first.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: I won’t be long-winded. You all know I
am a modest person, no matter my rank. Some of the crowd react silently.
Andromeda watches her mother with trepidation, but not as much as
Kepheus, watching from his throne.</p>
<p>****: This is not a celebration of a betrothal…</p>
<p>****: not the celebration of the happiness of two parents, or of our
good people. Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal
Entourage.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: This union represents new hope for a
lasting peace! That is the only cause for celebration. The crowd reacts
with exclamations and applause. Amoun wills her to stop. Cassiopeia
takes another drink, looks over at the Princess.</p>
<p>****: My sweet Andromeda… grown into a fine young woman, confident
and sure. Look at her! Isn’t she beautiful? Her subjects agree loudly.
Andromeda wishes this would end. Cassiopeia raises her glass.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: To my beautiful daughter… more beautiful
than all the women of Joppa. More beautiful than the Gardens of Nineveh…
Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a spiteful glance.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: More beautiful than the turquoise ocean
and its sublime Goddess of the Deep… Tiamat herself! My daughter is a
beauty even a Goddess must envy. Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed
MURMUR roils the crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother.</p>
<p><strong>cassiopeia</strong>: I’ve gone on too long – She stops with a
look of sudden dread. The Great Hall DARKENS. The torch flames TURN
BLACK. The temperature drops. The statues lining the hall shut their
eyes and the doors burst open. TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats
forward, parting the terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first
Olympian. Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her knees.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: You have blasphemed powers beyond
understanding… You, a stupid braying goat before the unfathomable
galaxies. You dare put this frivolous, scrawny slut…</p>
<p>****: above the infinite Goddess of the Deep!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS
NAKED. Her body, made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent –
sexy and terrifying. Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in
the streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of religious
ecstasy and outright lust. The celebrants shield their eyes, but
Cassiopeia can’t. She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
her frame –</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Look upon the sublime and know your error.
You’ll not blink. Tell me now, mortal, how bright your preening urchin
shines? No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but Perseus. Tiamat
notices Perseus… and his boldness.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: People of Joppa, hear me. For the sacrilege
of this arrogant creature, I will loose Leviathan upon you. The people
react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint, but Tiamat snaps her back
to consciousness –</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: I’m not finished. Hold your gaze. For thirty
days, Joppa shall suffer the scorn of Leviathan. And on the final day,
you will be wiped from the earth. Unless… Instant silence.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: unless you sacrifice that body so
impertinently compared to this</p>
<p>****: – your beloved, worthless Princessa. Andromeda GASPS. Shock
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: This is my will, Joppa. Desolation or
sacrifice. Choose your penance. You can thank your… . sickly, aged
Queen. Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then implode.
Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and withered, collapses. Kepheus and
Royal Aides rush to her.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Leviathan awakes…</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . Leviathan – First dweller of the deep. Hewn
by Tiamat from the dark blood of the earth…</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS
gathered before Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus
stands off to the side.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . All monsters of the sea are but shadows of
Leviathan the Kraken – colossal, rapacious, and nigh indestructible. The
men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he looks exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: My Queen lies near death. Am I now to
choose between the survival of our state… and the life of Andromeda, my
only child? Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an observer.</p>
<p><strong>minister of defense</strong>: I beg you, do not even consider
such a sacrifice –</p>
<p>****: Do you tell me only what you think I wish to hear!</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: The citizens of Joppa are fighting for
their lives. Would you have me gamble the city to save one girl? Again,
Amoun looks to Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>minister of defense</strong>: You need make no such choice,
Your Highness. Andromeda must.be saved, and the city too.</p>
<p><strong>repheus</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p>****: No… We need only the will to do it.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: You spoke the words – the monster is
indestructible!</p>
<p>****: How can that be? Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward
Perseus, with relief.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Perseus! You had something you wanted to say
to the King? All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self-
conscious.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What? No, Master Amoun. I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: You’re ‘listening’? We’re talking about the
precious life of your betrothed. Perseus meets his gaze, confused.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m a newcomer here. I would not presume to
tell these men –</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh perspective.
Share your thoughts with the King, your future father- in-law. The
ministers are puzzled by Amoun’s persistence. Perseus, uncertainly –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I know that I am young and have not seen
much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible.
The Ministers react to the young man’s arrogance.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: I am far from young and have seen much of
the world… and I agree with my son. Everyone turns to the new arrival:
Perseus’ adoptive father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Father, how did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: I thought this boy’s father was a God. How
does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: I sent for him, Lord. This good man raised
Perseus from infancy. He will help him now.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Help him with what?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: With whatever is needed… Perseus approaches
the King. Surprising himself –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: He will help me destroy Leviathan. Spyros
does a double-take, then swallows: “Yeah, okay, sure.”</p>
<p><strong>up on the balcony</strong>: Andromeda reacts, falling in love
with Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: But how? Perseus has no idea.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Majesty, we can seek the counsel of the Norn
Sisters of Skolothia. They know the hidden ways of the Gods. If
Leviathan can be slain, they’ll know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: We have thirty days to find its
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>minister of the interior</strong>: Twenty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: We’ll leave tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: With what army? I dare not weaken our
forces when the city is about to be besieged.</p>
<p>****: We’ll go alone.</p>
<p>****: Yes. Give us a map. Amoun laughs. When some of the others join
in, the King gives them a look that stops them dead.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: My King, with your permission… The King
assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: I’ll give you a map and much more. I’ll go
with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission.
We can leave at first light. Diokles, the map. The men move to the work
area, where the Aide selects a map from dozens. Something catches
Perseus’ eye.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ pov</strong>: Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made
herself visible only to him. She silently mouths these words – “Thank…
you.”</p>
<p><strong>at the map</strong>: which has been hung for all to see,
Amoun uses a pointer.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: We head north on the Via Dahlia. If we can
make it to the Disputed Territories… MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun’s
pointer on the</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . we’ll join the Cleon desert legion, the
most formidable unit in all the army… With their escort, we can safely
reach our destination in Skolothia, which lies to the east… We DISSOLVE
THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the
following:</p>
<p><strong>identifies them:</strong>: First, two fearsome Mongols,
MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Our guides will be Mongke and Tamburlane,
father and son monster hunters from the Kingdom of the Iron Horde. Next,
THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed old soldier, DRACO.
His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO, Draco’s lieutenant, and the soldiers
ABAS, ICOS, THAD, BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Our escort will be a detachment of the
Praetorian Guard, led by Commander Draco – the staunchest security force
in Joppa. Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider – the Wilting
Girl.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Why do we bring the Earth Goddess into this
danger?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: I thank the stars we have her. Besides, she
takes her orders from an authority much greater than I. Next, Spyros;
horseback riding is not one of his many skills. Behind him, Perseus and
Amoun ride talking –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence you came
into my life as tutor, so long ago, and now, once again you instruct
me.</p>
<p>****: No matter what you believe, Porpoise, some things are fated.
I’ve been looking forward to this journey for a long, long time. He
spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back beside Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Who would have thought we’d be on a journey
like this? Two simple fishermen.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m afraid I’ve dragged you into real
danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Living at the mercy of the sea so long has
convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers
unavoidable. It’s all in your attitude.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What’s our attitude about destroying
Leviathan?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: The Kraken is just another big fish. Perseus
smiles, but is not as sanguine.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: The demigod and his retinue are joined. They
march for the counsel of the Norn Sisters, to seek the frailty of my
Leviathan.</p>
<p>****: The Sisters…</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Yes. I beseech you, track the
expedition.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: To plainly thwart them would betray our
intentions and draw the wrath of Zeus and the others.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: That, we cannot have. I merely suggest that
the road to Skolothia is hazardous.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: I take your meaning. And your loyal brute, he
is fixed upon the hunt?</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Fear not, he is about and he will do his
share of damage. Set leaves. Tiamat resumes stirring the storm
clouds.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: You must sleep. Princessat You must take
care of yourself. A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: My father was ready to sacrifice me to
the monster.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: I’m sure that is not so.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I saw it. I heard the words. My loving
father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision.</p>
<p>****: And do you know the worst part, Peshet? He was right. Peshet’s
feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: The city is besieged, the people
suffer.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Because of me, because he did not offer
me up. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Go to sleep, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for
me, faithful one. In one month… at the latest. The palace shakes with
the ROLLING THUNDER.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess.</p>
<p>****: It will not stop. Tiamat knows no mercy.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: By what name may mortals call you?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: I have no name.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Who do your worshippers pray to?</p>
<p><strong>wilting girl</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Perhaps that is why they are falling in
number?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Wilting Girl flinches, and Perseus
feels guilty about his jest.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I have to call you something…</p>
<p>****: Since we’re naming you on this road, what about ‘Via Dahlia’?
She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He’s defensive.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: That’s a pretty name. Wait, better yet –
‘Vidalia’? How’s that… ‘Vidalia’? That’s more than pretty, beautiful
really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating
on the road ahead.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You don’t like it? What’s that? I missed it
–</p>
<p>****: I do not object. She picks up the pace, moving her horse a
little ahead. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: More. The Mongols stare – either not
comprehending or ready to fight.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: It must last all night. Get some more.</p>
<p>****: I’ll find some more.</p>
<p><strong>abas</strong>: Commander, I’ll get some, too. Perseus and
Abas head off into the woods in different directions.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The leaves offer tantalizing cover to her
naked body. She dives in with a quiet SPLASH.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Now is when an honorable man would turn
around and walk away…</p>
<p>****: . but they say I am not really a man. Vidalia surfaces and
drifts on her back, looking sadly into the sky. Perseus fixates on the
sadness in her eyes. His expression changes, and the tenor of this
stolen vigil is altered. RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a
CLOUDBURST pelts the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and
smiles. LIGHTNING.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus’ HEART POUNDS in his ears as he
watches. KRA- KOOM! The ROLLING THUNDER hits exactly on his heartbeat –
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! Vidalia instantly knows he is nearby. She looks around
quickly and huddles in the water. Perseus retreats. After a few yards,
he stops, face flushed with the awareness of a whole new dilemma.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Vidalia…</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: Hear me, my pet. Let my instructions be seared
to your primal mind as natural law.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: The monster’s eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink
to pinpoints.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: You are starving. Your gut says you’ll soon
perish. No earthly meat will still that hunger. What you need, what you
ache for, is the flesh of… a demigod!</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>icos</strong>: Perseus. How long do you think you could stay
on one of those? Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.</p>
<p><strong>boreas</strong>: Don’t goad the boy, Icos. No Man can ride a
Pegasus.</p>
<p><strong>icos</strong>: Did not Bellerophon tame the Great White
Pegasus?</p>
<p><strong>boreas</strong>: You’re right. But he was a demigod…</p>
<p>****: Then this will be a good way to find out just what I am.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Stop it, rogues. One of our own has
disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief.
What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up?</p>
<p><strong>boreas</strong>: Don’t worry, Commander, the boy won’t even
get on its back. With a “watch this” grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls
him back down.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Don’t do this. If we go back to camp right
now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight. A true leader will
not be distracted.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I’m
too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a
roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,
buffeting Perseus with gusts. The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over
Perseus’ head. It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks
Perseus face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when
Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into
the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>boreas</strong>: I’ll collect him right now, Commander.
Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL. The Pegassi take
flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and swallows it whole. Humbaba turns
and SNIFFS the air, homing in on Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Perseus, get out of there! Icos, fetch the
others. Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with swords
drawn to draw the monster’s attention. Perseus does the same.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: I told you to run, boy. You’ll make things
worse.</p>
<p><strong>icos</strong>: A Humbaba! Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the
woods; the others follow.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Boreas! Draco hacks at the monster’s leg, to
no avail. it rips off Boreas’ head and swallows his body. Perseus CRIES
OUT and leaps at the creature, sword swinging.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: No, Perseus!</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Get back! Vidalia spins her shepherd’s
sling to pitch lead sling- bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the
monster and thrusts his weapon – a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT</p>
<p><strong>hook.</strong>: Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke
lights the fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire and
metal. The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and swallows
Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one leg, but has it ripped
from his hands.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: A delusion is planted in its mind. It
thinks it’s starving and it wants to feed on –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Humbaba’s eyes bulge with surprise
as a saber pierces its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast’s
mouth with his saber.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: I can’t reverse the powerful curse. But if
the monster’s hungry, I can feed it. Vidalia raises her arms and shuts
her eyes. A cyclone of CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives
straight into the monster’s mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake them
away, Mongke is thrown clear.</p>
<p>****: Now! The belly! Slash the belly! Draco moves to do that when
Perseus leaps forward, lunges and sweeps his blade up Humbaba’s belly at
the same moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss each
other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others are shocked and
impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple entrails spill over Perseus and
Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES</p>
<p><strong>to the ground.</strong>: The flock of ravens, liberated from
Humbaba’s gut, shake the viscera from their feathers and take
flight.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: I should cast a spell upon you and leave
you forever a stone upon this stream.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I didn’t beckon the Humbaba.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You did, with your childish recklessness,
and Boreas has paid the price! Perseus, already rife with guilt, is
stung by the truth.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Your safety is entrusted to me by the
mightiest power on Olympos.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: But without a thought, you risk life and
limb, your own and your fellows’.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: The monster killed my friend. I could not
contain my rage. But you, Goddess, are aloof from the emotions of Men.
Vidalia’s eyes narrow, enraged.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who dares
question your mad rush to annihilation.</p>
<p>****: The hopes of multitudes reside with you. You’re late in
learning you cannot act upon every impulse. She whirls and walks away.
Perseus is left with the weight of his culpability… and the beginning of
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Where have you brought me?</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: It’s okay… Peshet tries to leave, but Agenor
stops her.</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: Just listen to this good man. He needs your
help. Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic gaze.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: Do you know who I am, child?</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: You are the Priest of the Streets.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: That’s right. You know that the good
common people of Joppa trust that I will look after their welfare.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Some do…</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: Do you love the people of Joppa,
Peshet?</p>
<p>****: Do you want them to be destroyed by this awful curse?</p>
<p>****: No, of course not. You want what’s best for the people.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: I have always served the royal family.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: Yes, you have, good Peshet. And now you
may be in a better position than anyone to help the Princessa save the
city.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Master Amoun… You knew about me, didn’t
you? When you came to our village?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Your birth was written in the stars. I sought
you out and took it as my cause to teach you.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You chose a poor student. I have learned
little and my mistakes cost dearly.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Understanding that is the first step toward
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>perseus r</strong>: It won’t do Boreas any good.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: You can honor Boreas by the way you act from
this moment forward.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m no demigod, Tutor. I’m not even much of
a human.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: It is not your choice. You are what you are.
Amor fati, Perseus. ‘Love thy fate.’</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I do not believe my fate is to be half a
God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Concentrate on the task before you. All
answers will come with that.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: A fierce group. Trained to fight… Amoun’s
DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we –</p>
<p><strong>territories</strong>: The desert camp of the Legion is lit by
torches. The LEGION SOLDIERS are handsome, powerful career warriors,
going about their evening business – eating, cleaning weapons,
washing.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . behind enemy lines. A LOOKOUT peers into
the dark desert, listening. Now he HEARS something, turns and shouts to
another SENTRY:</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: The Night Patrol returns on the Gorge Road!
That message is shouted along from Sentries to Guards in the camp. OUT
IN THE DARKNESS on the dusty Gorge Road, a dozen Soldiers gallop in
GROUND-SHAKING FORMATION toward the firelit encampment.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . They’ve been chasing Djinn Raiders in the
mountains for years.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Djinn Raiders?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They
fight like Hades himself is keeping score… From the dark SURROUNDING
DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol ride into camp and dismount.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: .. That’s how the Desert Legion came to be
called ‘God-slayers.’ I’m not ashamed to say I’ll be relieved to have
their protection the rest of the way… Amoun’s Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO
the barren, desert flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit</p>
<p><strong>scrub –</strong>: Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout
magically where there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS
surround the camp.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne
of rock. Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on Kalibos,
like a benevolent mother.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: My loyal friend. it is beneath you to stalk
this band of infidels one by one. Events demand more decisive action.
Kalibos’ SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body –</p>
<p><strong>kalibos</strong>: Grorashnrd… I to be… ruler… rhodirs… made
whole… sovfrenty… kingdom mine…</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when I
restore you to your rightful form – proud Acrisius. With me, your
protector, on the throne of Olympos… the violator Zeus deposed. Kalibos
reacts, with what must be satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Go down into this valley. See what I am
building for you – an army dangerous and fearless as you, their
leader.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: How much are we meant to suffer? Where is
your mighty King? Safely cloistered above the flood… on the high ground,
with the high- born – the privileged gentry!… The angry crowd responds,
fists shaking. Peshet moves through the throng, desperately looking for
Andromeda. She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers her
presence.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: . Does Kepheus worry about you? No! Only
the Princessa… And still, the Kraken comes! Does the King build his
defenses at the water’s edge? “NO!” cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked
to find herself replying with them – “NO1” Fantasos motions for Agenor
to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the stage.</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: No! He makes his stand at his daughter’s
chamber door!… We will show Kepheus we’re not sacrificial fodder. We
will tremble the walls of his Basilica! RABID SUPPORT from the mob.
Peshet stops suddenly, peering ahead.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda
herself watches from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants! We die so
she may live… As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.
Peshet fights through the crush to follow her.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: Peshet, you’ve come at the right time.
Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods, trance-like.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: One night soon, a gong will sound three
times. When you hear it, unlock the back gate of the Basilica. Then go
to Andromeda’s chambers… . and bring the Princess out. My men will take
her to Leviathan. Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: Do you understand me?</p>
<p>****: Peshet, do you understand how important your part is? She nods,
horrified by her predicament.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: You wanted to know about Djinn Raiders. Here
they are.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Look sharp. Watch your surround.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: The Alkali Lotus… She stops, spotting
something in the distance. Kosmo pulls up.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: shimmering through the desert heat –
tents and flags.</p>
<p>****: An army bivouac… flying the flag of Joppa. Its the Cleon
Legion.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Where is everyone? Spyros HEARS something and
follows the SOUND to a tent, weapon ready.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: Spyros comes out.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Draco, tell me what this – Everyone is
standing perfectly still. DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed
Cleon Legion lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers
they were is their armor.. Now they’re monstrous creatures:
LOTOPHAGI.</p>
<p><strong>close on a deformed foot</strong>: as it plants in the dust.
The companion foot lands beside it – completely different. TILT UP TO:
Kalibos. Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters. Kalibos
immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs the air around
Perseus.</p>
<p>****: Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We should leave… now.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I won’t do anything rash. I’ve learned my
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: This time you must do something rash. We
all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>kalibos</strong>: Tosharicana… demigod… expulsotat… Zeusl</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: No… Perseus. PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD.
The whole Expedition comes to life as – THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and
brutal. Long arms thrash and rip at the Praetorians. Mongke and
Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES. Spyros lobotomizes one with
his harpoon. Amoun opens a leather sack of sand.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Muster to me!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first
there. Amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The ring
of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of insects. Amoun shouts
to the others, still fighting.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts
for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides
inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes
zombies and runs toward the swarm. He’s almost there when one of the
Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his
sword into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and Spyros fight
their way to the swarm and jump inside. Mongke and Tamburlane kill a
Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle. The tide
of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no
avail.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus
takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Only humans… He looks over the Lotophagi
and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights
her way toward the barrier.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Drop the barrier! r</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: No! It’s too late for her!</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos
grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he
turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: “If you
want to save her, come and get her.” He hungrily rips her leather
bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Take the barrier down or I’ll go through
it!</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Have you learned nothing? If you break out
now, we’re all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia’s white
flesh. Perseus is anguished; he knows he’s in love.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’ve learned one thing for certain! Perseus
shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Get down! Perseus backs away three steps.
To the others –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus
runs, plants a foot on Thad’s back and leaps out through the swarm,
which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment
to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Let’s kill these freks! Perseus runs over the
backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks
Kalibos off Vidalia. Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives
Perseus a look: “You’re the one that I want.” They face off, looking for
an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges,
springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an
ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos’
head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!
Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He
opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus’ shoulder. Vidalia cracks
a rock into Kalibos’ head. The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens
toward her, head bloody. Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in
the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Kalibos slams down on the jagged
boulders and ricochets off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque
figure hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES. He slams
into the dust, dead. Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When
he tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him as he falls
forward and lowers him gently, looking at the bloody puncture
wounds.</p>
<p>****: Okay… sshh… I’ve got you. A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the
distance. Vidalia scans the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>down below</strong>: Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack
away, fending off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won’t last long. The
earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted, looking around nervously.
Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions. Riding them,
DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes. They
lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the beasts with HUGE
PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing SCIMITARS to cut them down.</p>
<p><strong>atop the rocks</strong>: in Vidalia’s arms, the fading
Perseus watches as the Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members,
closing in.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Vidalia… we need to help them… He blacks
out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos
fell. She is mystified by what</p>
<p><strong>she sees:</strong>: The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In
his place, neck broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace –
King Acrisius.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: To save me, you risked everything – your
mission, your friends… the fate of multitudes. Men need better judgment
in the one who is meant to lead them… No longer able to lecture, she
regards him with love.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You shouldn’t have risked your life for me.
It is a waste to save me when I’ll be gone so soon. She strokes his hair
and kisses his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Thank you for your reckless disregard.
Thank you, Perseus… Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT PODS. Vidalia
squeezes the salve from a pod and covers Perseus’ wound. The wound
bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus. Perseus shoots up, clutching
his chest. Vidalia gently lays him down. Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES
from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: The poison is gone now.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Where… Where are we? The</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: In the Djinn caravan. They’re escorting us
to the Skolothian border.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: But I thought the Djinn…</p>
<p><strong>vidalia .</strong>: We all did. But their leader, Shaikh
Suleiman, has some special interest in you. Just sleep. She waves her
palm over his face, and he does sleep.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: The Skolothians have suffered more than their
share in this war. The Legions of the Gods have battered them.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: It’s no wonder they shy away from all
strangers. Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting company
with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is staying – SHAIKH
SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.</p>
<p><strong>perseus l</strong>: Why does this Djinn priest stay with
us?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Because of you. You’re the reason they saved
us.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Me? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Why don’t you ask him?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I thought they didn’t speak.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: They have no mouths. That doesn’t mean they
do not speak.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: The Pillar of Moirai. Lair of the Norn
Sisters.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell me of them.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: They’re witches in the form of Strix. Not a
pleasant sight, a Strix. They have powerful magic and dreadful habits.
Baby-eaters, among other things. But they owe me a favor. When the war
broke out, they lent their power to men against the Gods in exchange for
infant sacrifice. Tiamat struck them blind for their treachery. When
they came for help, I fashioned them an artificial eye, for their Second
Sight.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You made only one eye?</p>
<p>****: Yes. They have to take turns. If they all could see at once,
they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so
grotesque.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Stay away from my boy! Without touching him,
the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with
an “UMPH!” Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has none.
Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge. Suleiman raises
his hand and freezes Spyros in his position. The Shaikh’s veil has
fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred
wood; eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh
lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil
over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I hear you and I understand you. But I
don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>shaikh suleiman</strong>: Moi ne epos ae’prositi, mene
daeva.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You are praying to me? There must be a
mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a
zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring
Zeus.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: An offering’? I thank you and take it
humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and
bows his head, surprising the Shaikh.</p>
<p><strong>shaikh suleiman</strong>: Tuj patir esti ho theos
kosmosr.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You honor my father? You honor Spyros?</p>
<p><strong>shaikh suleiman</strong>: Ho Zeus Patir… Zeus… Perseus
reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger.</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: Amoun… So sorry to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Likewise, Urd. I seek your counsel.</p>
<p>****: You want us to tell you about Leviathan.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: You know already… of course.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: We know this – the Kraken cannot be
defeated.</p>
<p>****: You’ve wasted a journey. I trust it was not a taxing one. The
Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos and Krikor,
terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the Eye back to Urd. Perseus
watches with growing irritation.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Surely the beast from the sea has some
weakness. You owe me this answer at least.</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man! She
tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention on Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: There’s something wrong with that one. I
don’t like having him here.</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: Let me take a look. Verdandi tosses the Eye
to Skuld. Perseus leaps and snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix
SCREECH. Perseus goes to the precipice.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell us what we want to know or your Eye
has seen its last.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Norns flap their wings and puff up
their feathers.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: You’ve brought a thief into our nest!</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: A villain!</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: Scum!</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: No, good Sisters… the son of Zeus. The Strix
react in horror and all land on the same monolith.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Since you cannot see, let me tell you
what’s about to happen. I’m about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks
far below. I fear its journey will be a taxing one. The members of the
Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, too: the young demigod shows growing
leadership. The Strix are panicked –</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: We can’t tell you. We don’t dare betray Tiamat
again.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: She sees all! Her touch is felt in every
evil thing!</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: A second offense and she will</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You don’t have to tell us the secret. But
you will have to live as blind as she made you.</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: No! Give us the Eye and we’ll tell.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell me first. If I like the answer, you
get your Eye.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: We need the Eye to see the answer!</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: You know the answer sure as you already knew
the question. The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of
wings.</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: Leviathan can be destroyed…</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: The beast has one weakness.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Tell us now! The Strix are torn, frightened.
Finally –</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: The stare of Medusa. No creature can look
directly in her eyes and still survive. The answer hangs in the silence
of the stunned Expedition.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: They’re lying, Perseus. Perseus studies the
Sisters, weighing his response.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I believe them. Here’s your second sight.
Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in her socket.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: And Medusa! Where does she abide?</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: In Tartaros, beyond the frozen Tethys Sea.
Only Charon’s ferry dare challenge the ice.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: How can she be slain?</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: With extraordinary cunning and
unimaginable luck. Skuld flaps to the pitch-black portal to an
UNDERGROUND</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: And the proper tools. Explore our cache of
spoils. You may find such a tool. Perseus stares into the black
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Don’t go in there, Perseus. It’s a trap.</p>
<p><strong>verdandi</strong>: No. We have guaranteed the rage of Tiamat
with this revelation…</p>
<p><strong>skuld</strong>: . we ask only that the young God mention our
aid…</p>
<p><strong>urd</strong>: … to his Father.</p>
<p>****: If ever I should meet him.</p>
<p>****: I need a light. The Shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until
the end bursts into flame and hands it to Perseus, who disappears into
the blackness.</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: Captain, the storm is too great!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Joppa is under siege! King Kepheus needs
these supplies! Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints
through the rain… and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of Leviathan. IT
GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving the fleet untouched. But then
– they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon. The dark sky gets darker as
an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them
at impossible speed – TIAMAT’S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that
it PLOWS THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating them in
seconds, sending all hands to the depths.</p>
<p><strong>frightening visage - night</strong>: Lit by FLASHES OF
LIGHTNING. The Goddess smiles in satisfaction at the devastation.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tell of the Gorgoneion.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: The Rape of Medusa? Everyone falls silent.
The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous.</p>
<p><strong>thad</strong>: With respect, Magi, do not recite that black
tale. You’ll bring the sky down upon us.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Does a fairy tale frighten you, soldier?
Thad looks at him, sharply.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Tell the story, sir. My men fear only one
thing – to let fear in their hearts. Mongke says something that means,
“Go ahead already.”</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Medusa was a tender young woman once – a
mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the Gods. One
night, on the road home, she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and
Entropy – Set the Void.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: She hastened to hallowed ground, thinking the
Goddess Tiamat would protect her in her temple. But the God Set
followed. A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in
pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH
THE SPECTRAL FOLDS – the girl’s reaching fingers, her screaming
face.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: He ravished her on the cold floor. She felt
the heartless passion of a God.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later</strong>: Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody
fingernails toward the altar.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Despoiled and broken in the shadow of
Tiamat’s altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage… But the
Goddess of the Deep regarded Medusa with disdain. The prayers of such a
frail and filthy mortal angered Tiamat. A bust of Tiamat chiseled from
black crystal opens her BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA
onto the wall.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: The Goddess twisted young Medusa into a
loathsome new thing… The contorting shadow shows the transformation.
Legs twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads wriggle
from her skull.</p>
<p>****: The Expedition all hang on Amoun’s every word.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: .. and cursed her with a hateful stare that
petrifies to stone all that look upon her. Grave silence. Draco realizes
he’s burned his dinner on the fire. Spyros shakes his head. Perseus just
stares, a believer. NOISES come from the fog: SPLINTERING ICE; SLOSHING
OARS. A SHAPE emerges – an ice-cutting THREE-TIERED GALLEY, oars moving
with precision.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Charon’s ferry.</p>
<p><strong>charon</strong>: Better stoke those fires, boys, it’s going
to get cold soon.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: She’s got a tail and she’ll use it just
like that. Perseus opens his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Keep your eyes shut! Open them with Medusa
and it will be your last look.</p>
<p>****: You’re enjoying this too much.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He can’t see her smile. Or that she
regards him with something hotter than amusement. She tries to punch
him, but he blocks it.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Good! Pleased, he doesn’t sense her right
cross, which knocks him down.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Do you think the Gorgon will hit once and
then surrender her head? He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the
defensive position, turning as she moves around him.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Listen… you will hear her muscles coil.
Feel her hunger in your gut. Ask, how will she feed it?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I wish it, but I can’t perceive the world
that way.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You can. You’re the son of a God.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Nothing I have done has convinced me of
that.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You do not see yourself clearly yet. In
time, your actions in crisis will sharpen your view. Her faith touches
him deeply. She resumes the lesson:</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You can do those things, Perseus, and much
more. He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: We think a room is silent until someone
points out the wind. Then the wind is all we hear. She strikes. He
dodges and locks her neck. Pleased, she flips him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Surprisingly, he lands on his feet, and
immediately sweeps her legs. She starts to fall backwards, but – SLOW
MOTION as Perseus dives forward and cradles her gently as they both fall
to the floor. A move beyond human. She looks up at his closed eyes,
worried. Their lips are inches apart. REGULAR SPEED –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m beginning to hear the wind.</p>
<p>****: Vidalia… why are you afraid? She kisses him, deeply. He returns
it. Suddenly, she rolls free and stands up, turning away from him.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Wait… She is already climbing the ladder.
She stops for only a</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: You’ve learned enough for now.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: A look I know well.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: From me?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Never before.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge,
calloused hand on Perseus’ shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: In my own mirror, son.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: When does it go away?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: If we’re lucky… never.</p>
<p><strong>shaikh suleiman</strong>: Jaggous temploi Tartaros de
Gorgoneion maitress.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: The Temple of Tartaros… Medusa’s lair. Mongke
and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They all</p>
<p><strong>look –</strong>: TWO STONE STATUES flank the entrance: a pair
of enormous CENTAURS – NESSUS and IXION, their eyelids sewn shut. Icos
and Krikor exchange distressed looks.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Medusa must have turned them to stone.
Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and adjusts his
shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m going into the Temple.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: I am with you.</p>
<p>****: I go with my boy. Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward
the temple. Suddenly, the two “statues,” Nessus and Ixion, shake off
their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the ridge, hooves
shaking the ground. They raise fearsome spiky maces of jagged iron.
Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his scimitar. Mongke and
Tamburlane load their handgonnes, the others draw swords.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Yes. You?</p>
<p>****: Stay close and I’ll steer us through. They tie on blindfolds
and feel their way into the Temple.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nessus charges Amoun. Amoun throws a
handful of sand, which becomes a hail of STEEL-BARBED DARTS in midair, C
which lash the Centaur’s flesh. Tamburlane rolls under the beast and
fires his weapon. Nessus hurls the monster-hunter against a boulder and
goes for him when – – Shaikh Suleiman jumps between them. His scimitar
slashes but is ripped from his hands. The Shaikh BOWS</p>
<p><strong>his head.</strong>: Nessus’ mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman’s
head of charred wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE
CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead. Ixion SLAMS his mace down,
just missing Amoun. Suddenly, Vidalia’s sling-bullets slice his flesh.
Ixion turns and leaps at Vidalia.</p>
<p><strong>draco</strong>: I hear her, Perseus. She’s near! Her torso
behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front. Draco spins and slices the
air. The RATTLE stops. Draco waits, confused.</p>
<p>****: Draco, be wary – ! Medusa gingerly tugs Draco’s blindfold free.
Draco sees the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins and
looks. Medusa’s face is inches from Draco’s. His muscles lock and his
flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY GAS. Medusa breathes in
the vapors ecstatically. AT THAT MOMENT a hole blasts through the roof
of the cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt – dead, a gaping
wound in his head. Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing
a</p>
<p><strong>mournful sigh.</strong>: Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls
his harpoon toward the sound. WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly
through slanted pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
through a tiny opening and – THUDS into Medusa’s body! The Monster
SCREAMS, whipping about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Perseus, I think she’s hit!</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Near to the left! Medusa’s enraged attention
shifts back and forth between the VOICES of the two men, deciding which
to attack. Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every sound,
head swiveling blindly. From a distance –</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Perseus… I don’t hear her near me! Perseus
steps back and BUMPS into a column.</p>
<p><strong>above him f-</strong>: Medusa is coiled around the column,
harpoon stuck in her bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.
Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME, Medusa’s fingers
reach for his blindfold. She pulls the knot and the blindfold falls.
Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle about until it
SMASHES into the column – BRINNNGI The SOUND ECHOES, then FADES. Perseus
waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of Medusa’s blood lands on his
shield. Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the
reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes. Searing eyes…
Medusa! Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa’s talons
DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his grip. Perseus scrambles
for it on his hands and knees. Behind him, Medusa SLITHERS down the
column and heads for Perseus. Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his
shield up in front of him and sees Medusa’s reflection growing closer
behind him. He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A soft
F-THMMP as the blade slices through something… SILENCE. Perseus turns
away and opens his eyes, looking into the shield. Still, Medusa looms
behind him! But suddenly, Medusa’s head THUDS and rolls on the ground.
The headless reflection topples over, dead. r-</p>
<p><strong>the aftermath</strong>: the survivors – Vidalia, Amoun,
Mongke, and Tamburlane – take mournful stock of their losses. Mongke
sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language. They all turn to see:
Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top of the Temple
steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack. Now it holds Medusa’s head, which
bloodies the whole bag and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is
still movement in there – squirming serpents.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: The relief fleet is lost. Monsters gather
outside our walls. Soon I won’t be able to keep my own people at bay.
And still, no word from the Expedition. Kepheus raises a spyglass to
survey the view beyond the city walls.</p>
<p><strong>spyglass pov - tiamat’s army</strong>: on the plain outside
the city. BONFIRES RAGE, monster regiments assemble. Siege towers roll
toward the city.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Tiamat commands a massive horde. How many
days remain?</p>
<p><strong>minister of defense</strong>: Four, Majesty… Kepheus lowers
the glass, looking grim.</p>
<p><strong>general andor</strong>: Our forces prepare. We have cards yet
to play. We’ll buy the time we need until…</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Until the Expedition perhaps returns?…
Until we’re saved by the fisherman’s son?</p>
<p><strong>minister of defense</strong>: My king, remember and take
hope… he is not truly the son of a fisherman.</p>
<p>****: From your lips, I pray, to his true father’s ear. Andromeda has
appeared. All are shocked to see her. She addresses the others with an
authority we’ve never seen.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I would speak with the King in
private.</p>
<p><strong>minister of defense</strong>: Princess, let us find a
protected</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: We can speak here, in the elements our
subjects endure. The King’s men exchange looks, then bow discreetly
away, leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down at the
tent city.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: They take refuge from the Lower Wharf. A
sight I wish you’d never seen.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: You’ve sheltered me too long from the
hard things in this world.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: I would have it no other way.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: And I thank you for the gift of my
cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so… It’s time I shared this burden
you’ve carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around
her.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: You make me proud, but you are only a
child… my little one.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: No, no longer. Your protection of me has
brought hardship to our people…</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I
must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks
down at the city.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: If you could end this siege with just one
unselfish act, would you do it?</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: To save my people, yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Such an act is within my power. He
studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>keph eus</strong>: Stop itl I forbid you to entertain such
thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Perseus and the others were willing to
give everything.</p>
<p><strong>kepheus</strong>: Listen to me. By the time this is over,
your mother and I may well be gone. But I guarantee the day is coming
when Joppa will know glory under Queen Andromeda. She embraces him, head
upon his shoulder, where he can’t see her resolve.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you
any more sadness than I already have.</p>
<p><strong>remaining</strong>: The exhausted Expedition is now six:
Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane. They’ve stopped
at a well beside a MILESTONE.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Spyros studies the ancient words carved
into the milestone: “Polis of JOVE PATER : XI stadia S.”</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Eleven stadia to the South… What is ‘Polis
of Jove Pater’? I’m ignorant of this.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus
was known. This milestone dates from when city states were named for
their patron deities. Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker
as Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters “-VE” and the other the
letters “-TER.”</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: ‘The Polis of Jove Pater’ is the ancient name
of –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: – Joppa.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Yes, Joppa… once the most sacred site in the
worship of Jove.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take
hostage.</p>
<p>****: She compels the people to make human sacrifice of the Princess
Andromeda…</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: . and transforms Joppa into the new church of
Tiamat. The ancient abode of Zeus…</p>
<p>****: becomes the new home of Tiamat, granting her sway to supplant
him as the God of Gods. You can’t allow Tiamat to rule Olympos.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus holds her look. “No,” he won’t
let that happen. But in his eyes are fear and doubt.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Father, we’ve seen much on this journey we
cannot hold in our hands. Yet these things are real enough. At each
turn, we find monsters and Gods.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Yes, the evidence is everywhere once we
leave our island. That’s why I so rarely leave. These Gods, what do you
make of them?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: As you always said, they’re petty,
vengeful… and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: Yes, as bad as men. And would you have that
sort guide your life?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: No. Men must be accountable to themselves.
Otherwise we serve poor masters.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: That’s my boy. Amoun rides up.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: We should stop for the night.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: We must keep moving. Time is running
out.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: If we don’t rest the horses, they won’t make
it to Joppa.</p>
<p>****: We all need rest. If you don’t save yourself, you’ll have
nothing left when you face the Kraken. Riding behind them, Vidalia is
suddenly alert. She peers into the woods, agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS
SOFTLY, dismounts and runs into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Vidalia! Perseus slides from his horse and
follows her. Mongke says something to Tamburlane; they LAUGH. Amoun
to</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Why don’t we stop here tonight? Spyros
smiles, looking off after Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: I know this place… Suddenly, she hurries to
the trunk of an ancient tree. She probes the foliage, steps forward… and
descends into the ground, out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: This is my church. Where I was born to the
world. Where my people prayed to me.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Who were they?</p>
<p>****: I know they were humans. They seemed so fragile. I sheltered
them because I thought the harsh world would break them. Now I know I
underestimated them. Her eyes pierce Perseus.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: When I saw you come out with Medusa’s head,
I saw that a Man had done an impossible thing. Beautiful, yes, but not
fragile. Resilient. Fearless.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I was mad with fear. I was no hero. I just
didn’t want to die. Perseus turns toward the altar.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What is this? A marble tablet sits on the
altar, its surface defaced. Vidalia runs her fingers along the
scoring.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: When the war began, Men ranged through the
hills, stamping out any trace of God-worship they found. My true name
was carved here. When it was obliterated, my worshippers lost faith and
my last season began.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: How long do you have?</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Only days.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What will happen?</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: I will vanish, quick as dew evaporating at
dawn.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: No one will notice the moment because all
thought of me will be gone.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Nothing can save me.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I don’t believe that. Will love not buy
another day, Vidalia?</p>
<p>****: I was cut free of earthly longing. Why did you have to give me
a name? The light is almost gone now. They kiss. The wilted blossoms in
her crown slowly open with color. They begin to make love.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: When you vanish, I’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Close your eyes. 1</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’d rather look at you.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Do what I tell you. I’m going to give you a
spell.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Don’t give away your secrets. You still
have need of them.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Let me give you this sliver of magic. I’ll
write it on your instinct. When the time comes, you’ll know how to use
it. She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to his.
Gently, her fingers slip into his mind. A TEAR runs down her cheek.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ pov</strong>: In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to
a black eye. Reflected in the eye – clouds roll over a stormy sky.</p>
<p><strong>then:</strong>: Feathered WHITE WINGS beat the air. Then:
Racing over the surface of a blue SEA, and then down, down, to SMASH
THROUGH the surface, into the depths.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: How did he do this? They were not even to
reach Medusa.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: Fate has begun to shift. The future ripples
with uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Spare me your pitiful maundering! There is
no Fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will.</p>
<p>****: I meant only that the demigod bends the path without knowing
it. He is ignorant of the rules, or unconcerned with them. She turns on
him with such a violent look, he flinches.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Then there shall be no rules! Prove to me
you have not lost that which makes you most valuable. Set absorbs her
tirade, stung.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: And Zeus… the others?</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: I am your ally. That is all you need to
know. Bloody your hands and rid me of this pestilence.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong>: You have liberated me, my Queen. Watch as your
desires are quickly satisfied. Set disappears.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: This is my fault. I’ve permitted .this
infatuation to progress too far.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: It is not yours to permit, Master… with
respect. Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of
berries.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: Look what I’ve found for us – She startles
when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.</p>
<p>****: Have you forgotten Perseus is engaged to the Princessa?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I won’t marry Andromeda.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Both Amoun and Vidalia are
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: If by some miracle you survive this encounter
with Leviathan, the hand of the Princessa is your reward.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I want no reward.</p>
<p><strong>amoun</strong>: Are you so selfish? Would you risk everything
for the foolish love of – A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the
Shrine. The berries turn brown and shrivel. Amoun grabs his chest.
Perseus and Vidalia crumple in agony. SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE
SHRINE. Amoun tries to invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and
Amoun splits open. Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen
wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her. Perseus staggers
up and swings his sickle, but Set points, ripping the weapon from
Perseus’ hand. It flies across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into
the tablet that once held Vidalia’s true name. Still choking Vidalia,
Set grabs Perseus’ arm. Perseus doubles over, paralyzed by the God’s
touch. Suffocating, Vidalia FADES MORE. Immobilized, Perseus watches her
struggle and searches</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I am half God… and now is the time… Perseus
rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an ear-splitting CRACK OF
THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and
lurches back, aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth. Perseus, his
face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The God’s body SPASMS and deforms in
DEATH THROES.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly
heap, which liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the sandy
floor, leaving an ugly stain. Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is
more evanescent than ever. They look with pain at the remains of
Amoun.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: I’m so sorry, Perseus. A look of brutal,
determined resolve grows in Perseus’ face.</p>
<p>****: You faced a God in lethal combat… and vanquished him. Never
have I heard of such a thing. He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts
her as he stands.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: We must go quickly now. He pulls the sickle
from the marble with a BRINNG! The light flashes off Zeus’ LIGHTNING
BOLT PATTERN on the blade.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: The combat has just begun.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: We invoke thee, Queen of the Deep. We
attend thee only to listen and obey. Fantasos moves through smoke to an
altar, on which is a fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation
we’ve seen.</p>
<p><strong>fantasos</strong>: We serve your will so that we may be
absorbed into your perfection… Holy of holies… Tiamat! The Sanctuary is
suddenly filled with the VOICE of –</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: Loyal servants… it may be an illusion, but
the Idol seems to have taken on the most subtle of life. It does not
move, but it breathes.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: You have sown the seeds of revolt. Now comes
the harvest. My legions stand ready at the gates. Only one rite of
consecration remains before the Ascension. Fantasos, closest to the
Idol, flinches, buffeted by an unseen draft.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: The hour of sacrifice is upon us. Offer up
the Princess Andromeda to Leviathan.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign
of Andromeda.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: My lady? Princess Andromeda? She goes deeper
into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,</p>
<p><strong>alarmed –</strong>: Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her
balcony, preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,
teetering. Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a knife
of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Peshet, stop! I know what I am meant to
do.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: My lady, please –</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to
understand that the fate of so many could rest with me.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Princessa, give me your hand. Andromeda,
please. Please.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I’m not afraid anymore. I will do what I
must. I will die so that they may live.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her,
pulling her to safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING
on the marble.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: I won’t allow it, my lady. Today, you are
only a Princess. One day your people may need a Queen ready to die for
them. Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it.</p>
<p><strong>peshet c</strong>: Come, we have to hide you… right now.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She stops, picks up Andromeda’s knife
and hands it to s her. Andromeda accepts it with resolve.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: We must get to my mother and father. A
VOICE from the darkness:</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: Your father is dead and your mother has been
relieved of her suffering. The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light.
Agenor wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: The Princessa is coming with us. She has a
rendezvous to keep. Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS
into the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet. Before he can
fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her knife. She plants herself in
front of Andromeda.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Come and get her. Agenor and the other two
circle Peshet. She moves with feline agility, but is separated from the
Princess. To the Second Rebel –</p>
<p><strong>agenor</strong>: Take the Princess – alive! The Second Rebel
circles around Peshet toward Andromeda.</p>
<p><strong>peshet</strong>: Run, Princess! Save yourself. Peshet leaps
on the Third Rebel. Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who
easily closes the gap.</p>
<p><strong>second rebel</strong>: You’re not going anywhere, Your
Highness. He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny within
his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He JOLTS in surprise,
Andromeda’s knife in his belly. He falls on her, dead. Peshet wins her
struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking her dagger in him. She GASPS.
Agenor has thrust his blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS – deep
and bloody. Peshet falls against the wall. Andromeda WAILS at the sight.
She is pinned beneath the dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to
move. Agenor finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.</p>
<p><strong>from behind the group</strong>: They’re on a shelf above the
wide, flat basin that lies outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY –
Centaurs, Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe – fills the plain, right
up to the city walls.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: If it should come to pass, tell your mother
and sister I loved them much. Perseus reaches out and touches his foster
father warmly.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You’ll have to tell them yourself.
Vidalia’s voice has become weaker.</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: The people are frightened. But they can
triumph.. They need only one thing. Perseus turns to her, a question on
his face – “Tell me… 11</p>
<p><strong>vidalia</strong>: A hero. They’re waiting for you, Perseus.
Perseus looks back toward the city. At last, there is no uncertainty in
Perseus –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I will not fail them. He turns toward the
Goddess, but Vidalia is gone.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Vidalia?</p>
<p>****: No. It’s too late. She’s disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>gong.</strong>: Agenor brings Andromeda barefoot through the
mud. The onlookers jostle for a better view, some spiteful, some sad,
all curious.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Agenor removes Andromeda’s cloak,
revealing her tattered nightgown. Fantasos inspects the MYSTERIOUS
SYMBOLS inked on her naked back, streaked by rain. Agenor’s thugs chain
her to the winch at the precipice, hundreds of feet above the raging
sea. As the winch is cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from
the ground. Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin. She
spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of the chain.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda’s pov</strong>: As she RISES: The cliff drops
straight down the jagged wall to the churning waves.</p>
<p>****: O Leviathan, firstborn of the Deep, accept this offering of
mortal flesh… for the exaltation of your Cosmic Mother.</p>
<p><strong>the faces of the onlookers</strong>: Then… GONG! Fantasos
continuing his incantations, then… GONG! Andromeda’s face, her
frightened eyes searching the ocean. Everyone looks out to sea,
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: The sacrifice has begun.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I must get to the cliffs!</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: How? They all look at what separates them
from the city –</p>
<p><strong>battle cries.</strong>: The GATES OF THE CITY swing open. Out
march the giant mechanical AUTOMATA, followed by streaming legions of
JOPPAN INFANTRY. The two armies slam together – The battle is joined.
THEY FIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda’s pov</strong>: The Kraken slips underwater and its
vast shadow immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt.</p>
<p><strong>flashes of what perseus sees</strong>: A white lid opens to a
black eye… Feathered WINGS beat the air… The rippled flanks of a WHITE
CREATURE.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Perseus HEARS the BEATING OF THE
WINGS and looks toward the forest. PEGASUS WHOOSHES over the treetops,
BANKS and LANDS in front of Perseus. It bows, inviting Perseus aboard.
Perseus climbs on and rides up to the others, who are flabbergasted.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: May we all have a good ride today! He spurs
Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the ridge with astounding
power.</p>
<p><strong>mongke and tamburlane</strong>: Qi chin yang hung xian!</p>
<p><strong>spyros</strong>: No shit. They raise their weapons and spur
their horses down the slope to war.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Andromeda manages to get herself
swinging back and forth until she builds enough momentum to reach up and
grasp the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very chain she
dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath. Leviathan’s eyes break the
surface below, watching Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES
UPWARDS, jaws wide.</p>
<p><strong>from above - andromeda</strong>: Leviathan grows huge as it
leaps for her. UP, UP, UP. The JAWS SNAP CLOSED… just below her climbing
feet. So close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN! The monster
slides back down, clutching the chain in its jaws. The Princessa
plummets with it.</p>
<p><strong>up on the platform</strong>: The chain unreels wildly, pulls
tight… and rips the platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge,
taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their screaming death. A
SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one, they tear their
gaze from the sea and look up, GASPING</p>
<p><strong>at –</strong>: PERSEUS AND PEGASUS descending. Perseus sees
Andromeda splash down and get pulled under. The winch platform SLAMS
into the cliff face, pulled by Leviathan.</p>
<p><strong>perseus’ diving pov</strong>: Exactly the image he saw when
Vidalia first planted the spell in his mind – down, down toward the dark
sea.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Perseus and Pegasus arrive a moment
before the crashing winch. Perseus dives off with the bloody Medusa bag
in hand. With his free hand, he catches the chain just ahead of the
winch and goes under.</p>
<p><strong>far above</strong>: Perseus grips both the chain and the bag
in his hand. Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and
the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the monster, sinks,
weighted by her shackles. Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a
porpoise, dives after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he
looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack – both sinking. Perseus goes
after the sack. Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her. Andromeda,
drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from her nose. Leviathan swims
down to her, eye as big as her entire body. The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER
rests on the ocean floor. The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on
a harpoon wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and is
about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the harpoon. Leviathan opens
its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked toward the maw. Perseus swims upward
toward Leviathan’s tail. Perseus concentrates – a sparking BURST OF
WHITE ENERGY shoots through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the harpoon in the
Kraken’s tail – – at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
Andromeda. Contact – an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge races
up Leviathan’s spine. Jolted, the monster spits Andromeda out. The
Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus. Perseus shuts his
eyes and yanks Medusa’s head from the sack. Medusa’s hellish eyes ignite
channels of boiling energy into Leviathan’s enormous eyeballs –
hardening them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The monster thrashes, tries to turn –
but unbending stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves –
the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent hook. Dead in
the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a mountain range, picking up
speed as it plunges into the</p>
<p><strong>abyss –</strong>: Perseus must swim like a God to snatch
Andromeda from the downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as
it</p>
<p><strong>drops –</strong>: – and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING
THE OCEAN FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed and
sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks away across the
seabed, swallowing all the water above it, creating a giant opening to
the sky.</p>
<p><strong>tiamat</strong>: I damn you, Zeus! You will hear my curses
forever in the crash of</p>
<p><strong>surf –</strong>: Walls of water collapse, burying the
Goddess, her ship, and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a
world- rocking ROAR, which booms off toward –</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>****: Are you all right? She takes a moment, doing an inventory.
Finally, she nods.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: I think I am. He smiles. She’ll never
know how close they came to oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Are you ready to become a king? His
expression is kind, but unmistakable. “No.” She accepts that,
rueful.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Are you ready to become a queen?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She thinks about it, her face beginning
to light with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>andromeda</strong>: Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Then you’re ready to go home. Perseus
raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD BEATING OF WINGS.
Andromeda looks up in wonder. Pegasus appears out of the sun’s glare,
gracefully alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and then
climbs on behind her. Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they
are lost from sight.</p>
<p><strong>a distant pov of the queen</strong>: The ceremony and the
heavenly setting.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill.
Behind him, Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS
UP. Just as quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus looks in
that direction, to find – ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched
on his arm. He couldn’t look more imposing.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Am I to understand you do not intend to make
this union with the Queen Andromeda?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Despite my will and intention that you do
so?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Would you choose to condemn Men, your own
people, to suffer more of this devastating War?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I have no people. You have stranded me
between realms, neither man nor God.</p>
<p>****: Do you reproach Zeus?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: No. I thank you… Father. Zeus, mighty God,
reacts to the word. His expression softens and he looks on Perseus with
growing pride.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You have freed me. I will not be a pawn for
Men or Gods.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: Does that absolve you suddenly of your
responsibilities?</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: You’ve made me understand that my
responsibility is to myself. So it is with us all.</p>
<p>****: You’ve put me to a great test. In the midst of it, I found the
courage in my heart to defy Gods. I do not know how much of that comes
from you, Father… and how much from my Mother, who I never knew. Zeus
starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: It matters not. Whatever the source, I are
only grateful. He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
throng.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: This war will end the moment you choose for
it to end… and Men agree. I think, perhaps, that is the free will that
all realms share. Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful – what an
offspring, what a creation!</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: What will you do, Man of free will? Perseus
motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his back.</p>
<p><strong>perseus</strong>: I’m going to find Vidalia.</p>
<p><strong>zeus</strong>: So… my Son, you will be a pawn for love?</p>
<p>****: Yes, Father, gladly. Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into
the sky. And soars away.</p>
