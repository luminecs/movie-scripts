<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You can’t smoke in here.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: A Mercury is a good car and that’s what I
was driving that day. I’ve owned a lot of cars. Different kinds. Lots of
different kinds of cars. She was standing, this girl, on the side of the
street where there was a chicken stand; not the Colonel, mind you, but
nevertheless a chicken stand, and I pulled the Mercury over and rolled
down the window by electric power. She was wearing a leather skirt and
she had a lot of hair on her arms. I like that. I like it a lot. It
means a big bush. I like a big bush. She said, “Are you dating?” I said,
“yes,” and she got in the car. We pulled to a remote location, one that
she and I both felt comfortable with and she said, “How much can you
spend?” I said, “What it takes to see your bush. I know it’s a big one.”
She said “twenty five dollars,” which to a working man is not chicken
feed. I produced the money and she put it in her shoe and pulled up her
skirt. There before me lay a thin, crooked, uncircumcised penis. You can
imagine how badly I wanted my twenty-five dollars back.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: I don’t know why you’re so weirded out,
this is not San Quentin, it’s just a nuthouse. Most of these people
don’t even know where they are, they’re not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: In a few minutes we’re gonna be in a room
with a killer. That doesn’t bother you?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Hey, you’re the one that wanted to major in
journalism. Anyhow, wasn’t the guy something like twelve or thirteen
when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn’t even
remember it.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Do you smell shit?</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: These are the people from that newspaper
deal.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Oh yeah, from the college?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: My name’s Jerry Woolridge.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Nice to meet you. I’m Marsha Dwiggins and
this is Theresa Evans. She’s here to take the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Y’all have a seat. Is this all of
you?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I think there must have been a little mix
up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn’t be
any pictures. It’s s’posed to be just a little story or article or
something, isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well, yeah, it’s for the school newspaper.
But it has pictures. I mean it’s a regular paper, you know.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Karl’s real sensitive about having his
picture made. He wouldn’t even be on the bulletin board for the Easter
Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar
substitutes? You girls want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: The other thing is I told your boss on
the phone to send a man. Karl won’t talk to women.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: There was a young man named John Liggit
Hunter who was in the filling station business and a good filling
station business. He was one of those young men that we run across so
often in life. I’m sure you’ve run across them, that didn’t deserve the
things he had. One of those things was his beautiful bride, Sarah. She
was a Georgia Peach. As a matter of fact she looked more like the
picture I’ve had in my head than any woman I’ve ever seen. I took it
upon myself to take her away from John Liggit Hunter, who didn’t deserve
her. I’m not sure if I mentioned that he was a Frenchman who claimed to
be an Englishman. It took some very strong nylon cord to take her away
from him. She was a fighter as well as a Georgia Peach.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I don’t know what to tell you. I’m sorry.
I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn’t
thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade
science.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well, what do we do? We drove all the way
out here.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Let’s just go, Marsha.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: No, we have to get this story.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: I thought you’d be happy to leave.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Why won’t he talk to women?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: He has problems. You know. With all that.
He won’t hardly talk to anybody really. Just certain people. He’s very
troubled.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: A shovel just makes too goddamn much
racket.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I don’t think he’s talked to a woman in
twenty-five or so years. That I know of anyway. That’s why I said to
send a man. At least maybe he’d answer a question or two for a man. I’m
all for helping the college out, believe me. It might be a real good
article or story.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Can’t you talk to him? Maybe talk him into
it. I’m a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to
the old classroom.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I’ll talk to him and see what we can
do.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that
sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He
couldn’t really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his
father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made
sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a
toolshed, right?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I knew he slept in a toolshed.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: His mother told him that he was their
punishment. Hers and his father’s; from God, for having sex–</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Before they were married?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I don’t think so. Just period, I think.
She told him… God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl
has an entire book – a notebook. On every page it says “Franklin Chapter
1 Verse number 1.” He wrote that a few years ago after he’d learned to
write. His father’s name was Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: That’s really strange. What does it
mean?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: One of his Daddy’s Bible lessons I
imagine. Y’all pull up a chair. I’ll go out and talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: You have to make something explode to truly
understand it. You have to examine the tiny particles while they’re on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Karl, I gotta take you down to the old
classroom. Mr. Woolridge has some people for you to see down there. Come
on. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Karl, you know, do you remember when I
told you about those people from that newspaper? They want to ask you
some questions about your release. They think it would make an
interesting story. Will you talk to ‘em? Get interviewed. Now, they’re
women. I think it might be good for you to. You’re gonna be seein’ all
kinds of people when you go on the outside. This’ll help you I
believe.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, it surprised the dickens out of me.
He said he’ll talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: But, here’s the thing. He’ll only talk to
you. He doesn’t want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn’t stare at
him.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: How am I going to conduct an interview if I
can’t ask him any questions?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: It’s the best you’re gonna get. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Can I ask you a question? If he’s so
troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It
happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: He’s free. His time’s up. That’s the
rules. He’s been treated and reevaluated. He doesn’t show any signs any
more.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Signs?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Homicidal signs. Oh, we’re gonna change
the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: You’ll have to step outside.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Can I just sneak in there? I won’t take any
pictures, I promise. I just want to listen.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: No ma’am. I’m sorry you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You can’t smoke in here. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Well, I reckon what you’re a wanting to know
is what I’m doing in here. I reckon the reason I’m in here is ‘cause I
killed somebody. But I reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come
me to kill somebody. Well, I reckon I’ll start at the front and tell
you. I lived most of my life out behind my mother and father’s house in
a little old shed and my daddy’d built for me. They didn’t too much want
me up there in the house with the rest of ’em. I mostly just set around
out there in the shed all the time a lookin’ at the ground. It didn’t
have no floor but I had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or
tow that I put down there. My daddy was a hard workin’ man most of his
life, not that I can say the same fer myself. I most just set around the
shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off
and on from time to time but the children there made quite a bit of
sport of me, made fun of me quite a bit. Some of ‘em roughed me up
sometimes so mostly I stayed out back there in the shed. My daddy worked
down at the sawmill there, down there at the planer mill for an old man
named Dixon. Old man Dixon was a very cruel feller, he didn’t treat his
employees very well, didn’t pay ’em much of a wage, didn’t pay my daddy
much of a wage, just barely enough to get by on. But I reckon he got by
all right, they come out one or the other of ’em, usually my mother, and
fed me pretty regular. At least I know he made enough for me to have
mustard and biscuits three or four times a week. Old man Dixon had a boy
named Jesse Dixon. Jesse was really more cruel than his daddy. He made
quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls
around the neighborhood quite a bit. He used to say my mother was a very
pretty woman. He said it quite a bit from time to time, when I was at
the school house. Well, I reckon you want me to get on and tell you what
happened so I reckon I’ll tell you. I was settin’ out in the shed one
evenin’ not doin’ too much, just kindly starin’ at the wall and a
waitin’ fer my mother to come out and give me my Bible lesson and I
heared a commotion up in the house there so I got up and run up on the
screened-in porch there to see what was a goin’ on, and I looked in the
kitchen window and I seen my mother a layin’ there on the floor without
any clothes on. And seen Jesse Dixon a layin’ on top of her having his
way with her. Well, I just seen red. I picked up a kaiser blade that was
a layin’ there by the screen door, some folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade. It’s just a long handle like a axe handle with a
long blade on it that’s shaped kind of like a banana. Sharp on one edge
and dull on the other. It’s what the highway boys use to cut down weeds
and whatnot. I went in the kitchen there and I hit Jesse Dixon up side
the head with it and knocked him off my mother. I reckon that didn’t
quite satisfy me so I hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut his head off. Killed him. Well, my mother, she
jumped up from there and started yellin’, “What did you kill Jesse fer?
What did you kill Jesse fer?” Well, come to find out my mother didn’t
really mind what Jesse was a doin’ to her. I reckon that made me madder
than what Jesse had made me. I takened the kaiser blade, some folks
calls it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up
side the head with it an’ killed her. Some folks has asked me if I had
it to do over again would I do the same thing. I don’t know, I reckon I
would. Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here and here I’ve been for a
great long while. I’ve learned to read some; took me four years to read
the Bible. I reckon I understand a good deal of it. It wasn’t what I
expected in a lot of places. I’ve slept in a good bed for a great long
while. They’ve seen fit to put me out now. They tell me they’re a
settin’ me free today. Anyhow, I reckon that’s all you need to know. If
you want any more details I reckon I can tell ’em to you. I don’t know
if that’s enough for your newspaper or not.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Will you ever kill anybody again, Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon I got no reason to kill
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Is he leaving right this minute?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: We’ve got some paperwork to take care of.
Pretty soon. Don’t worry, you won’t run into him in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I didn’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins,
with your school and your paper and all.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Where will he go?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Wherever he wants to. I think he’s going
back to Millsburg where he’s from. It’s just about twenty miles from
here.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Will he be supervised?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: As much as anybody else is, I guess.
Y’all have a good rest of the day now.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I’m gonna have to get used to looking
at pretty people.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Yes, I guess you are.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I’m gonna have to get used to them
lookin’ at me, too.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: You better go get your things.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t got nothing but them books.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: You better go get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I was kindly wantin’ somethin’ or ’nother
d’eat.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Well, what did you want?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You have any biscuits for sale?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Naw, we don’t have biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Did you decide, sir?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What you got that’s good to eat?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Well, I guess it’s all good.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What do you like to eat here?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: French fries. I like to eat them pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: French-fried potaters.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: How much you want fer ’em? I’ll get some of
them I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Give me the big’uns.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry,
too.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What you got in there, warshing?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Ain’t you got no mama and daddy to tend to
it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I got a mama, but she’s at work over at Ben’s
Dollar Store. My daddy’s dead. He got hit by a train.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: How fer you going with them sacks full of
warsh?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: About a half a mile I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’ll help you tote ’em if I don’t give out
first.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Okay. You don’t have to though.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: My name is Frank Wheatley. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Karl’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s you last name?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Childers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are all them books?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Different ones. One’s the Bible. One of ’ems a
book on Christmas. One of ’ems how to be a carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How come you’re carryin’ them around with
you.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Ain’t got nowhere to set ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you live somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I did live there in the state hospital.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why’d you live there?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I killed some folks quite awhile back. They
said I wadn’t right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous
hospital instead of puttin’ me in jail.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They let you out?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They told me I was well. They had to turn me
loose.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you well?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I feel all right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t seem like you’d kill nobody.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is my house. You can just set those bags
on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you like to play football?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I never was much count at it. I never did get
picked out fer it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays
down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to
come by and play. We ain’t no good either. Well, I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: How does a feller go about gettin’ up to the
state hospital?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You buy a ticket for fourteen dollars and then
set and wait for the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Karl, what in the world are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I want to come back and stay here.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, you can’t do that. You’re a free
man. You’ve been let out to do as you please.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I don’t care nothin’ about bein’ a
free man. I don’t know how to go about it.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, you have to learn. It’ll take some
time. Don’t you know anybody down there to help you out?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Your daddy’s still livin’ down there from
what you told me. I guess he wouldn’t help you any, would he? I wasn’t
thinking. You don’t know anybody?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to
he’p me out anyway.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Listen, Karl, the truth is I don’t know
where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up
to me, I’d let you stay here if that’s what you wanted. I’m just doin’
my job. You follow me? Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop
deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You’re good
workin’ on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with
him, will you work at it if he’ll hire you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and
whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I know, I’ve seen it myself. Would you
give that a try?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I can’t promise he’ll hire you. I’ll have
to tell him about your history.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I never was no good with history.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: No, I mean your past. About why you were
in here. I’ll take you first thing in the mornin’. You have anyplace you
can stay tonight at all? I just can’t let you stay here. It’s the rules.
If something happened well, I’d be liable.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I can just walk around till the
mornin’. Or set and read me a book somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. woolridge</strong>: Karl, would you like a muffin?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. woolridge</strong>: I understand Jerry is going to take
you somewhere else tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon I know nobody name Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: She’s talkin’ about me, Karl. That’s my
first name.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He’s a-carryin’ me to look fer work in
Millsburg where I was borned.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. woolridge</strong>: Would you like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Coffee makes me a might nervous when I drink
it.</p>
<p><strong>daughter</strong>: Daddy, can I be excused to go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama tonight.
I’ll sleep with your brother and Karl can take your room.</p>
<p><strong>daughter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: We have company. Now you go on.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, Karl, there’s plenty of blankets
and things there. Bathroom’s right there in the hall. We’ll leave first
thing tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. woolridge</strong>: Jerry, why didn’t you give him
Bubba’s room? Sister’s is kind of girly, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Yeah, I thought about that. No sense in
moving him now I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Daddy, don’t you think one of us ought to
stay up all night and kind of - guard or somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Why, hell no, son. What’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Well, he’s crazy. He’s a nut ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. woolridge</strong>: ‘Isn’t’ he, Bubba. Don’t say
ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Karl, you up?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Didn’t you go to sleep at all, Karl? You
been sittin’ there like that all night?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, I guess we better hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey Jerry, how it’s goin’. Good to see you.
Been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Good to see you, Bill. How’s everybody
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin’ me crazy and
Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can’t complain other than
that. Wouldn’t do any good if I did. Do you know Scooter, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: No, don’t guess I do. Scooter who sort of
Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on
the phone. Now like I said, I’ll understand if you get nervous about it.
I’m not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was
real young.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I remember it real well. Cut them folks to
pieces. His mama one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: And that ol’ Dixon boy. Hell, I always
wanted to kill him myself. Asshole’s what he was. I remember that ol’
boy too. Kind of retarded or somethin’ back in school.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted these
days. I don’t think he’d ever hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t look much like he could. You say he can
fix a small engine like nobody’s bidness.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: He’s a regular whiz at it. That’s all he
did when he was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I ain’t scared of him workin’ here. You
know me. I’m a church goin’ man. Forgivin’ man. When your time’s up the
Lord’s gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: I don’t guess. Can he talk?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate it.
He needs the job. I don’t know what to do with him. He don’t have
anybody really.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That old man of his still livin’ over there on
Clark Street I believe.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: He won’t have anything to do with him.
Now you say it’s all right for him to stay out here in the back?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fine with me. If he steals anything, I’ll take
it out of your pocket anyway.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: He won’t steal. I’m tellin’ you he’s a
pretty good ol’ boy. Keeps to himself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I’ve got a roomful of work for him to
do. Can’t get Scooter to do any of it.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Karl, come over here. I want you to meet
your new boss. This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here
and stay in the back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good to know you, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now it’s minimal wage and there ain’t nothin’
but a army cot and a toilet back there.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: That’ll be fine. Karl, I’ll go to the car
and get your books.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They say you’re a whiz on fixin’ lawn mowers
and things.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’ve tinkered around on ’em a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually.
We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I like them french-fried potaters.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: They make a good double meat burger.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right then, I’ll see y’all later. Karl you
done a good day’s work. They right about you. Scooter, he’s gonna knock
you out of a job if you’re not careful. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: Wait up, I’ll leave with you and lock
up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Karl, they’s a blanket up in under that cot
and soap in the bathroom to clean up with. Now there’s one more thing.
The way we lock these doors at night, you can’t get out. You didn’t want
to go anywhere, did you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If it works out and all, maybe we’ll get you a
key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys
pissin’ off the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There was these two old boys hung their
peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old
boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, “Boy this water’s
cold.” Old boy from Arkansas says “Yeah, and it’s deep too.” Get it?
That’s a goodun.</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: Yeah, that’s a goodun. I believe you did
tell me that one before. I’ve heard that a bunch. Long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, yeah it’s a classic. You know, Karl, I
got to thinkin’ about it last night and it’s just not Christian of me to
not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don’t
need me keepin’ you locked up. You need to come and go as you please.
Here, take this key, it’ll get you in and out that back door. keeps
eating french Them french fries good?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah, they’s good all right.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They give me fifty dollars when they turned me
loose. I spent up some of it on ridin’ the bus and eatin’ french-fried
potaters.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I’m gonna pay you today for this comin’
week, so you’ll have some walkin’ around money. When you get off this
evenin’ you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin’ up supplies to
have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin’ to keep
you busy at night.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll let you off while it’s still
daylight.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the
porch. Wasn’t your name Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah it is. Your name’s Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. What you doin’ by here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You told me to come by.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did you want to play ball with us?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t no good at it. I just come by.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, anyhow, I was just fixin’ to go see my
mama down at Ben’s Dollar Store. She’s workin’ two till eight.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You
can meet my mama.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t want to worry your mama with
company.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Aw, come on. You’ll like her. She’s real
nice. She’ll give us somethin’ if we ask her to. Candy or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I was kindly needin’ to do some tradin’.
Reckon they sell toothpaste?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They sell some of everything. Come on let’s
go. I won’t tell her about you bein’ in the state hospital for
killin’.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Let me guess. You want a bunch of candy and
a pop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: You’re gonna rot your teeth that way. But I
bet I know what you would like even better. I put potted meat on
special, four cans for a dollar and they’re not moving very well. I’d
sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t like potted meat. Daddy used to say
it was made out of lips and peckers and intestints.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank, don’t talk that way. Who’s that
strange lookin’ man behind you? Did he follow you in here?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, that’s Karl. I met him at the laundrymat.
Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan’s the manager. He lets mama
off any time she feels like it ’cause they’re best friends.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nice to meet you, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Pleased to know y’all.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank come back here with me for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever seen you
before.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw, I don’t believe you have. I don’t reckon
I never been in here. This store didn’t used to be here.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s been here seventeen years. Did you
live here before or something?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’s horned and raised here up till I’s twelve
year old.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: What brings you back?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What’s that you say?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Why are you here now?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They turned me loose from the state
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Is that right? Are you going to be staying
here long?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work
for Bill Cox’s outfit.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Do you have family here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Not really to speak of.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay
with us. Out in the garage. Our car won’t fit in there anyway. It’s real
neat.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank told me about your situation. And Frank
loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all.
There ain’t no sense in you stayin’ in that old greasy shop. He’s
mentally retarded, poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: He just got out of the state hospital.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can we get some candy and pops?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Are you sure it’s safe to let him around
that guy?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank’s just crazy about him. He likes the
way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: He’s been in the state hospital a long
time, something must be wrong with him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s retarded’s all. You know he’s always
after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain’t a good one with his
mean ass.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t think he sees you as a guy guy.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Karl is a guy guy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is what I call my secret place ‘cause I
come out here when I feel like bein’ by myself. I used to come here with
Karen Cross. She’s kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says
she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I’m gonna get her back ‘cause I love
her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each
other with a flashlight. She didn’t want to have anything to do with me
in front of other people ’cause I don’t have any money. Well, mama and
me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here
though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin’ right on that
stump you’re on. See, her daddy’s a dentist so they’re rich. So’s Jerry
Maroney’s daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw. Didn’t have too much. Enough to scrape by
on, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They still around, your folks?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: My mother’s dead. My daddy’s s’posed to be
around still. He don’t want to have nothin’ to do with me though.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He never did want to. I figure he ain’t
changed his mind much.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How did your mama die?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You don’t need to know all of that. You’re
just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you’re still a
boy. They’ll be plenty of time for the other.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy
died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My
mama’s real good, but I wish I had both of ‘em. When we went to Memphis
one time in the car, it was rainin’ so hard we couldn’t see the road.
But I wadn’t scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin’
nothin’ could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now. Mama has a
boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he
makes a pretty good livin’. He still don’t help mama out with any money
though. He ain’t no good. He’s mean to her. He don’t like me at all.
Mama says it’s because he’s jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him.
He stays with us all night sometimes, but he’s got his own house.
Somebody told me it’s so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it
on the nights when he ain’t at our house. I’m not so nervous then.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: How come her to keep bein’ girlfriends and all
with him if he’s mean to her?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She says it’s for the times when he’s good to
her. She’s lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don’t know
why. He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill
him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he’s real
good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he’s not able to do anything to
Doyle, he’s funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to
go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too
good. He sure is nice though. He’s from St. Louis. People who are queer
can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But
mama said the real reason he left is ‘cause his daddy hated him. For
bein’ the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I’d rather him be
mama’s boyfriend than Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a
train.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah, I remember you a-tellin’ me that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It ain’t the truth. He shot hisself with a
shotgun on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Why did he do that, reckon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: ’Cause he didn’t have enough money to take
care of us the way he wanted to. That’s what the letter said. He got
laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care
of us fine. Karl, did you really kill somebody?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who did you kill?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Two people.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Were they bad people?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I thought they was.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe they needed it.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I growed up and got taught it ain’t right to
kill nobody.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s okay if you’re lookin’ out for yourself.
If it’s self-defense. Was it self-defense?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My daddy was good. I think too many good
people die. It ain’t right. That’s what I think.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with
these folks? You’re welcome to keep on stayin here. It’s workin’ out
real good.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That boy wants me to.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right then. I’ll see you bright and early.
How you comin’ along on that garden tiller?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I fixed it. Hit’s a workin’ pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You done fixed it? I’ll be damned. Scooter
told me it couldn’t be fixed. ’Course Scooter’s about as shitless as one
poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I’ll just be damned. See
you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, honey, I don’t guess I give a shit. I
ain’t here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin’ in the
garage, I don’t guess I care. I’ve got a good tool box and socket set
out there I don’t want stol’d. I guess I could take it home with me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s real honest. He wouldn’t steal
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Now son, I wadn’t talkin’ to you, was I? Was
I?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: No sir’s right. I’m talkin’ to your mama.
This is your mama’s decision, not yours. I’m lettin’ it go on because
she asked me, not you. Now is this the kind of retard that drools and
rubs shit in his hair and all that, ‘cause I have trouble eatin’ around
that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets.
I can’t so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of
antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin’ retard.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Doyle, you’re awful. You shouldn’t be that
way.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I ain’t sayin’ it’s right. I’m just tellin’
the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s just mentally retarded, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: He had of went nuts and did somethin’. They
don’t put you in there for just bein’ a retard. They’s retards all over
the place that ain’t in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I ain’t sure.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You might want to find out. He might of
hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, Frank, you better ask
him. I mean, don’t hurt his feelin’s or anything, but it would be good
to know. I’m sure it’s nothin’. He seems real sweet.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You sure are hung up on people bein’ sweet.
Speakin’ of which, where’s your girlfriend? I thought he was comin’ by
here for something.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’ll be here in a little while, he’s takin’
me to get an ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ain’t that the sweetest thing. What am I
supposed to do about supper with you traipsin’ around with that fag?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re not crippled. Get in there and make
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Boy, ain’t you somethin’ else. Talkin’ back
and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank, why don’t you go off and play in your
room if Doyle’s gonna talk nasty.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I want to watch T.V.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell,
let’s all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your
homosexual friend gets here.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: So, you’re really going to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That boy wants me to.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Did you knock on the door yet?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw, I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: How long have you been standing here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Quite a spell, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Listen, before you get very used to staying
here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you
to lunch?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I done et just a little bit ago.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I mean tomorrow or the next day.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin’
or ‘nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of
french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin’ it
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Okay, I’ll come by Mr. Cox’s and get you at
noon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey. Y’all come on in.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Tolerable, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why
don’t you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a
game or somethin’. Vaughan, you ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Sure, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t rush ever’body, honey.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Naw, I don’t want to. Me and Karl got things
we need to do.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard
you been puttin’ it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral
home.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I know Albert. We’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I heard you was more than friends. I heard
Dick Rivers caught y’all all bowed up and goin’ at it in the same room
with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed
out on a gurney.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: That’s ridiculous. That’s just a total
lie.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let’s go, Vaughan. Frank, we’ll be back in a
little while. I’ll bring you back somethin’. You’re food’s in the oven
warmin’ over.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: See, you made him somethin’. Hey Vaughan, I
was just goin’ on with you, jokin’ around, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Yeah, I knew that. You’re a card all
right.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, Karl, let’s go out to the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Goddamnit, I’m talkin’ to the man. You set
right there, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What’s in your bag?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What’s all them books?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Different ones. The Bible’s one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You believe in the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: A good deal of it, I reckon. Can’t understand
all of it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, I can’t understand none of it. This one
begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat
and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are
you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stop it, Doyle!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You be quiet, Frank, we’re talkin’. The
adults are talkin’. Were you in the lockup for cuttin’ somebody up with
a hatchet?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t never used no hatchet that I
remember.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You’re just crazy in a retarded kind of way
then. It wouldn’t matter to me if you did do violence on somebody ‘cause
I ain’t afraid of shit. You think I’m afraid for you to stay here.
You’re just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I’m
just jokin’ with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all
the friends he can get. Frank’s a real weak little kid. His daddy taught
him how to be a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stop it, Doyle! Don’t talk about daddy, you
hear me!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t talk about daddy. Y’all go on to the
garage and let me be.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t tell your mama we had a little spat.
She don’t need to be worried with your ass.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate
him.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You ort not to talk that way. You’re just a
boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He ort not to talk that away to you neither.
He ain’t no count. He’s mean to you and your mama. Yore mama and that
feller that’s carryin’ me to get somethin’ d’eat’s gonna be back here
directly.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Will you stay here with us for a long
time?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that
potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t see how you can eat that stuff with
all those insides it’s made out of.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I like the way you talk.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I like the way you talk.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here
was to talk to you about something that is on my mind. instead Karl eats
french fries and stares at the I guess I’ll put it right out on the
table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me.
They’re like family. My own family was never like family. They’re
horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that
my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I
was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don’t care. You see, you
and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically
or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the
hand we’ve been dealt in life. We’re different. People see us as being
different anyway. You’re – well you have your affliction or whatever and
I, well mine’s not as easy to see. I’m just going to say it. I’m gay.
Does that surprise you? That I’m gay. You know what being gay is, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon not.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Well that’s a very offensive way to put it.
You shouldn’t say that. You were taught that, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’ve heard it said that way.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Anyway, it’s hard to live gay, that’s the
right way to say it, in a small town like this. I’ve wanted to leave
many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person
that we won’t go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I’m rambling. If
you’re going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it
won’t be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but
a monster. A dangerous person. I’ve told Linda that one day that man is
going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see
it in his eyes. I’m very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make
your life hell. You’re a perfect target. When I first saw you I was
afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I
felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has
adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like
that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you’re in for.
I have a good feeling about you. You’re good for Frank. Maybe it’s that
he can have an adult friend on a child’s level. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean
it in a bad way. There’s one more thing. It’s none of my business why
you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past,
maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something – terrible. But what I
see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is
that you’re capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would
never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I wouldn’t never hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: That’s what I thought. I hope I haven’t
offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be
in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I was thinkin’ I could use me another helpin’
of these potaters.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Oh. How about before that?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Before that I was thinkin’ it’d be good if I
could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any
extry.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How come Karl won’t eat here with us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know. He just said he’d eat out
there.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t let it get to you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I just feel sorry for the poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who could eat with him settin’ there makin’
that goddamn racket with his throat.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He does make some funny noises.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like
a race car motor idlin’. It makes me not be nervous.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m glad of it, honey.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What have you got to be nervous about? You’re
a damn kid. You ain’t got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady
to stay on your ass all the time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I get nervous, that’s all I know.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You know what, by God?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You know what we ought to do tonight?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Please Doyle, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and
get the band together and just party our asses off. I’d like to show
that fuckin’ Karl to the guys. They’d get a kick out of that. Don’t you
know they would.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Please don’t. Not tonight. I’m not up for it.
They always stay till mornin’. I’m just give out, Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You don’t have to do anything but pour some
potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Last time you got mad and run Morris and them
off and said to stay away from here.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That ain’t none of your damn bidness. Besides
that’s the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I’m gonna go call ’em.
Honey, find my guitar, I think it’s out there in the garage with that
loony tune.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Karl, now listen, there’s gonna be a party
tonight here at the house. Doyle’s invited his music-playin’ buddies
over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They ain’t even no good. The only one can
play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he’s an Indian. His real name’s
Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play
guitar.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s no more an Indian than I am though.
Anyhow, Doyle’s gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off
to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just
ignore it. Or stay out here away from ’em if he’ll let you. He’s an okay
guy till he gets drunk but tonight he’ll get drunk. I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He ain’t ever okay to me.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, it’s on! We’re gonna rock. Linda, call
Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I’d like him to be here. I owe him a
good time.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No Doyle. Vaughan don’t want to come to a
party with you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him.
He’ll be here. Or I’ll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me
ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Okay ladies and gentlemen or both. It’s come
to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on
lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.
Well, come on, y’all are supposed to clap now. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Karl, you better clap your hands or he’ll
just keep on.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: On the bass, give it up for Terence “One
Ball” Atkins. On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin’
genius of the group. On drums “The Johnson.” And last and most
importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and
the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the
next world fuckin’ tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They’re
workin’ their asses off here. Okay I’d like to dedicate this next one to
some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female
companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what’s
your last name Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Childers.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Karl Childers just in from the state
facility. Make one of them gruntin’ sounds Karl or whatever it is you
do. Oh well, Karl’s a little retarded, he don’t know what the hell I’m
talkin’ about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance
right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune
for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You like that Vaughan?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all
right.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You enjoying yourself, Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I wished you all would lay off for tonight. I
can’t hear myself think for that racket. It’s nighttime, now let folks
be! I’ll call the law!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I told you already three times, the laws on
my side. I play cards with J.D. Shelnutt, chief’ of police. Get fucked
you old bastard! Okay now, Linda, you and the kid clean up and get a
tarpaulin over this instruments. Me and the boys are goin’ to the county
line. We’re out of liquor and beer. Come on Karl, you and Vaughan are
goin’ with us.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I’d better go on home now, it’s late. I
have to work tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Come on, don’t be a pussy. Everybody has to
work.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He don’t want to Doyle. Don’t go Vaughan if
you don’t want to. You’ll wreck Doyle, you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: But honey, I’ll be good. I promise. I love
you sweetie. I’m just tryin’ to help these two be part of things.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Are you sure you can drive? You’ve really
had a lot of alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Shhhh! This is the national anthem.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Not that you afflicted sons of bitches would
know anything about it, but this is art.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey Freddy, what’s goin’ on boy. I seen your
pitcher in the paper for catchin’ that big-ass bass.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Yeah She was a big ‘un. You ain’t drunk
drivin’ are you Doyle?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I figured that. Well you better be careful
with that cripple in the back. You’ll throw him out. Looks like you got
a wagonful.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We run outta somethin’ to drink. Goin’ to the
county line. You want to race?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You know better than that. We’re on duty.
Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Catch you later Freddy!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I bet you like sittin’ between two men in a
dual wheel truck don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Oh, yeah, I’m thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the
band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We’d be glad to have you.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Anyhow I’m not sure if you follow me on
those particular points, but it’s not really important in the smaller
picture, which is where most people dwell anyway. Not that being manager
of Ben’s Dollar Store is insignificant. Or that making it through years
of incarceration in a state supported facility is any small feat.</p>
<p><strong>the johnson</strong>: Morris, he’s the only one in the band
that went to college.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I’m in junior college right now over in
Westfield.</p>
<p><strong>the johnson</strong>: That ain’t no college, that’s trade
school. Auto repair ain’t ever made a genius out of nobody.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Holidays are for campers.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: What do you know about bein’ a genius,
Johnson. You can’t even hardly keep a steady beat on that high-price
drum set.</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: I think y’all play really tight together,
Randy. Y’all shouldn’t throw off on one another.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Anything that has to be discussed can’t mean
anything.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You got that shit right.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: What exactly do you mean by that? I don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Exactly the point, my young levelheaded
friend.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I rest my case.</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: Morris is real smart with philosophies and
things. That’s why him and me are the songwriting team of our group. I
make up good tunes or melodies as we call them and Morris is the
lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Not unlike Gary Brooker of the Protocol
Harum.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: We don’t ever play any songs that y’all
wrote. I never even heard one of ’em. Y’all just talk.</p>
<p><strong>the johnson</strong>: We don’t even play any songs with words
at all that I remember. We ain’t got no fuckin’ microphone. Or speaker
set up.</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: We wrote one last night standin’ outside
Mini-Mart. Morris called it “Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car.” Then, you
know, like on country songs in parenthesis it says “There is usually
someone in the trunk.” I came up with a tune just humming.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: See Vaughan, you shouldn’t question a genius.
Morris is a modern day poet like in the old days.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Our latest composition is as follows:
entitled: “The Thrill” – “I stand on the hill Not for a thrill but for a
breath of a fresh kill Never mind the man who contemplates doing away
with license plates He stands alone anyway Baking the cookies of
discontent By the heat of a laundrymat vent Leaving his soul” dot then
drop down to the next line “Leaving his soul parting waters Under the
medulla oblongata of mankind.”</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: I don’t think that’s right. I believe dot
dot dot come between medulla and oblongata or something like that. Well
it did. It wadn’t before mankind, I know that much.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The dots are where I say they are. Melody
and tune. That’s your trade. You’re a tunesmith Terence.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I don’t really understand the meaning of
the words.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If y’all don’t shut up I’m gonna go out of my
mind. And plus you’re liable to bust a spring in Karl’s head. He’s
already off balance.</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: That wadn’t the way you made it up before,
Morris. That’s all I know.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: We don’t need fancy words, we need to
practice. We don’t ever rehearse.</p>
<p><strong>the johnson</strong>: We need some payin’ gigs instead of
just messin’ around on first one patio and then another’n.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Morris, you should just be the manager, you
can’t play nothin’ anyway.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We don’t have a goddamn band! Y’all just shut
the fuck up! We don’t need no practicin’ or managers cause we ain’t no
fuckin’ band! Morris ain’t no genius and the rest of you are just
losers. Am I the only one sane human bein’ around here? Just get the
hell out of my house and don’t come back!</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s not your house, Doyle, it’s
Linda’s.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’ll kill you, you fuckin’ faggot! You mind
your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn
back.</p>
<p><strong>terence</strong>: What about our instruments?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>the johnson</strong>: You ain’t right Doyle. Somethin’s wrong
with you. Nobody needs your shit.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The dots just look good on paper. You don’t
sing ’em anyway. You’re showing your true Aries colors now.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Get out of my goddamn face, you fuckin’
buzzard!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I thought I told everybody to get out of my
house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and
go.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is not your house, Doyle. This is my
house and I’ll say who stays and goes. You’ve got a house, why don’t you
go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You know better than to talk like that when
I’m hurtin’. Don’t make me knock the piss out of you.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Doyle, don’t you lay one hand on her.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’s funny. You go to bed and take snot
nose with you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re not stayin’ here tonight. Go get sober
before you come back. I’m tired of my child seein’ this. Now you get
yourself straight or I’ll lock your ass out of my life for good.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You know what I told you, you even think of
leavin’ me, I’ll kill you dead as a doornail.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That might be better than this.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I’m a witness. I heard you threaten her
life.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I thought I told you to keep out!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Okay, I’ll leave and sober up. Everything’s
botherin’ me, that’s all. I’m hurtin’ Linda. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, I hate you, too. No I don’t. I love
your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I’ll leave. You bunch
of freaks have fun. I’ll call you tomorrow honey. I’m sorry. You can
kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I’ll
make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You all right, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m fine, honey. Let’s just try and forget
about tonight.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We don’t need to think bad thoughts, do we
Mama?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, honey, we don’t. I’ll make some coffee
and start cleanin’ up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No, ma’am. Coffee kindly makes me nervous when
I drink it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What are you doin’ up again, Frank? You need
to get a little sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did Vaughan go home?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while.
I do too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did Karl go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing,
he’s probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back
and live in Mr. Cox’s shop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I bet he don’t. Karl likes me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know he does.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mama?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is everything gonna be all right someday? I
just stay nervous all the time just about.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, honey, someday everything’s gonna be
all right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Doyle wouldn’t really kill you, would he?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I promise we’re gonna get away from him. The
time has to be right, that’s all. I’d rather him get tired of me and
leave me. Then he wouldn’t want to hurt me. He wouldn’t care then. We’ll
be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I love you, too, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I didn’t aim to.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Want to sit down? Did you need somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Two fellers was on a bridge a takin’ a leak
and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep
water. One of ’em came from Arkansas, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll be dog.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Do you reckon you can make me some
biscuits?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Just whenever you take a notion to. I don’t
aim to put you out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I
can’t go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it
is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn’t
slept at all?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, set down and I’ll make some biscuits
and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Mustard’s good on ’em to me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s all right. You know I was thinkin’
there’s this girl that works with me. She’s real heavy, but she’s cute
in the face. Well, you know, she’s slow. She’s a little bit, I think.
She’s not retarded, just – it don’t matter, listen to me. I thought you
might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at
his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I wouldn’t mind a havin’ supper.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vaughan’s “friend” will be there, too. He
works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He
says you make him feel calm.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I like Frank. He’s a good boy. Me and him’s
made friends.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hit ain’t right for me to keep from tellin’
you how come me to be put in the state hospital.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s okay. It’s not really my business. I
have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse
Dixon. I thought they was a-doin’ wrong. I was about your boy’s age.
They say I’m well now from it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Was that you? I remember that. I was only
three or four, but I always heard about it growin’ up. They say you’re
well?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes ma’am. I like your garage. I wouldn’t
never hurt you or your boy. I’d lay my hand on the Bible and say the
same thing.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I believe you. I really do.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How ’bout you, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: How are you, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Doin’ pretty good. Got a sick tiller here.
What’s got you down this way?</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Just thought I’d check on Karl and see if
everything’s working out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, he’s pretty quiet. Except for them
rackets and breathin’ things he does. Ain’t threatened me with a killin’
or anything. But boy you couldn’t of been more right about him fixin’
things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower.
Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don’t even so much as belch.
I’m proud to have him.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Is him stayin’ here workin’ out?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s gone to stayin’ over with that Wheatley
boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him
damn near like a mascot. But he’s got a key here to come and go as he
pleases. Everything’s worked out good.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Scooter! Run get Karl for me.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay staying with
that woman and boy?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Do they know about you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: My history.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I told ’em about it. They know I’m well. That
Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That boy, he’s my friend. He likes the way I
talk and I like the way he talks.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I knew you’d do all right. Well, I just
wanted to check on you. I’ll say bye to Bill and get on back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Karl, see if you can figure out what’s wrong
with this thing. It won’t crank up and ever’thing seems to be put
together right.</p>
<p><strong>woolridge</strong>: I’ll see you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay, stop back by. Don’t worry about your boy
here, he’s doin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hit ain’t got no gas in it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: See there. Thinks of the simplest thing
first.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: So Karl, do you intend to stay in the
lawnmower business for a while or do you have other plans?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I think Karl is going to be a writer or a
librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read
constantly.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t read ‘em yet except two or three of
’em. I can’t understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit
wonders off to somethin’ else when I try to read.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I’m the same way. Of course, in my line of
work, I stay too busy to read. But at least I have job security. People
may stop doing a lot of things, but one thing is for sure, they won’t
stop dying.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why don’t we talk about something a little
more festive.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Does everyone like the food?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Good. I haven’t decided yet if I’m a good
cook.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted
employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn’t that
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes ma’am, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Well, when you like pricing items as much
as I do, I guess it’s just bound to happen sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to
take a walk or something after dinner. It’s a nice night.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vaughan, don’t get pushy.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I like walkin’ quite a bit from time to
time.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: I stay on my feet all the time at work. I
just can’t find shoes that’s comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Hospital shoes might be the answer. Nurses’
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Or the kind old ladies who work in the
school cafeteria wear.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Same difference.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: I get real mean when my feet hurt. It’s the
only time I don’t like checkin’ out the customers, when my feet
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank, you and Karl aren’t talkin’ much, you
boys must really like that food.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I just don’t have anything to say about
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Listen everybody, I know this may sound
corny, I’ve had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little
emotional, but I’m going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a
rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you
at this table.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s very sweet of you Vaughan. We care
about you, too. Don’t we y’all?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Also, Melinda, please don’t tell anybody at
the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Well, a lot of people in town talk and
spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my
life private.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: You mean about y’all bein’ together in
“that” way?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: I think everybody at the store knows that
already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story
about why you ain’t allowed over at the First Baptist Church no
more.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Karl, why don’t you and Melinda go take a
walk. It’s nice out.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: You walk fast, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: These is the worst shoes I own for walkin’.
How far did you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t really thought about it too much I
don’t reckon.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey Karl, they’s somebody out here to see you.
Some gal holding a nice bouquet. Come on now, she wants to talk to you.
Don’t just set there.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Hi, Karl, I’m on lunch break. These was on
sale ’cause they’re not fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus my ten
percent employee discount. Since I didn’t bring you anything to our date
last night, I thought you’d like to have ’em.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Scooter, let’s me and you go over to Dairy
Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.</p>
<p><strong>scooter</strong>: I can go. You don’t have to. You don’t
never go.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my
language, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Well, I just thought I’d give you them. I
liked walkin’ with you. I got a blister the size of a quarter on one
heel. Well, I’ll see you sometime, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: A blister shore can hurt.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Flowers is pretty. I’ve always thought
that.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey Karl, you off work?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’d you get them flowers?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That gal that made employee of the month give
‘em to me for awalkin’ with her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was goin’ to the secret place. I borried
one of your books to take down there. You ain’t mad, are you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw. You can look at all my books you want
to.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s name’s A Christmas Carol.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That’s than un on Christmas I was tellin’ you
about.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You want to go with me?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m gettin’ tired of readin’ for a while.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time
ago, didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me
up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, me too. That was nice of that woman to
give you them flowers.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hit was right thoughty of her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was wantin’ to ask you somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know that girl I told you about. The one
I love.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah, I recollect it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Would you go see her with me? I kind of
thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: If you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I ain’t got no money to get ’em with but I
bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I bet he will. I got a little money if he
don’t. I’ll get ’em for ye.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if
they’re home. Reckon why they don’t like me?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They ort to. You’re a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just ’cause I’m not rich don’t mean I don’t
love her.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And I don’t try to touch her. You know, in a
bad way. Foolin’ around, sex and all.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That’s real good. You ort not to if ye ain’t
married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things
that don’t seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it
close as he can, though. You don’t touch yourself, do you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Pull on your works. Your privates.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, jackin’ off?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir. You ort not know that language.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I didn’t know till here while back a year or
two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just
tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt
funny thinkin’ about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin’ about his
mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles,
don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You ort not to pull on yourself that away.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I kind of like you tellin’ me what to do and
not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn’t mind him tellin’ me. I hate
Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away
from him is for him to get away from us. That we can’t leave him or
he’ll try and hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He ain’t no count.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t seem like a daddy. You seem like a
brother. Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don’t
even know ’em like what happened with me and you.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon I know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And then some people you don’t like right
off. It’s funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: ‘Cause it’s fun. It don’t matter if you ain’t
no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you’re doin’
it. When you run real fast tryin’ to make a touchdown you don’t think
about anything else. I ain’t no good, but my daddy always said he was
proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any
brothers and sisters growin’ up to play with?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I had one there for little bit. Hit didn’t get
old enough to play with.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why not? It died?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hit was borned a little too early on. My
mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon
they changed their mind about havin’ another’n. I was about six or eight
year old then and they didn’t care too much for me so I reckon they
didn’t need somethin’ else to worry ’em with.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So it died when it come out?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: My daddy come to the shed out back and got me
and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin’ in
it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see
‘cause they was a noise and somethin’ movin’ in it. Hit was bloody-like
around that towel. Hit was a little ol’ bitty baby, no bigger than a
squirrel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It was alive?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir. Right then it was.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A boy or girl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: A little ol’ boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You threw it in a trash barrel?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I didn’t feel right about doin’ that. I
takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some
screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in
that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more
proper to me, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It was still alive when you buried it?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I heared it cryin’ a little through that
box.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That don’t seem right. It seems like you
should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I wadn’t but six or eight. I reckon I didn’t
know what to do. I didn’t know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy
didn’t want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days
I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord
right off the bat anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That makes me feel real sad. Couldn’t you
have done somethin’, Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He’d
be here right now. Livin’.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hits been hard thinkin’ about it. They ain’t a
day goes by I don’t think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in
my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I
wished they was somethin’ I could of did, too. Shouldn’t no bad things
happen to childern. All the ol’ bad things ort to be saved up for folks
that’s growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn’t of told you about that.
A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I didn’t mean to say anything bad about you.
I know you’re good. You didn’t mean no harm. Did you ever think about
killin’ yourself on purpose like my daddy did?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’ve studied about it. The Bible says not to
or you end up goin’ to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it
Hades.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bible says the same thing about killin’
others, too.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir, I reckon it does.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I always get nervous when I hear that
doorbell. I’m okay just walkin’ over, but somethin’ about that dang
doorbell. They have one room where you can’t walk on the carpet or sit
on the furniture. I don’t see much sense in havin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Son, I don’t know why you keep comin’
over here. You know these folks don’t want you here. They run you off
ever’ time. Don’t keep doin’ this to yourself. You a sweet boy. Now go
give them flowers to somebody that’ll enjoy ’em.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ma’am, I really want to give them to
Karen.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: You his daddy?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Well, whoever you are, you ought to
talk some sense into him. That little old girl is way too fast for him
and don’t wanna see him no way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Will you get her for me. Please. I really
want to see her. She’ll want to see me, too, ’cause we’re not in public.
Just don’t tell her folks I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hey Frank. You shouldn’t be coming over here.
My parents really don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wanted to bring you some flowers. They’re
pretty good ones.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They’re from the Dollar Store. I’m not an
idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He’s my
new friend. But I feel like I’ve always known him. I thought you should
meet him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why? Hi, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s gonna be around a lot and I hope you are
too, so…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Here give me the flowers, I’ll do something
with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I’ll see you down at the
secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend
now you know. And we’re pretty serious. He gave me a ring.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We
could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at
the secret place. Okay? I can’t go there now. I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But maybe just for awhile –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m closing the door now. I told you, I’ll
see you later.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She said she’d see me later. That’s kinda
good, right?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned, there’s the boys. I’m
glad y’all came in. I wanted to talk to y’all, too. I was just tellin’
Linda here – Oh hell, I’ll just start over, set down you boys.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, what it is is, I just, well I took off
work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we
could talk. I guess you’d say I’m really here to apologize, which ain’t
easy for me to do, about the way I acted the other night. I was just
drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another.
I care about y’all a lot, I do. I don’t mean to be so damned, assholish
I guess the word would be. Now Karl, I don’t believe I hit you, did I?
So no apology needed there I guess, but Frank, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I
hit your mama. I’m just jealous of her. I don’t like her life or the way
she runs it. I don’t like homosexuals and she buddies with one. I don’t
like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin’ mental retards and she’s got one
of each livin’ with her. I was just kiddin’. But really I guess people
need to get along even if they have differences. You see, I work
construction. I build things. Do you realize how important that is to
the world. I have a lot of pressure on me. The upshot is, I’m gonna
spend a lot more time over here and we’re gonna get along. Like a family
should. I may even surprise you one day and pop the question. Well, I’m
goin’ back to work. I just wanted to give y’all some little piece of
happiness today. See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a good boy, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, at least he’s tryin’. But who knows for
how long.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s lyin’ Mama. He ain’t gonna do
better.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know honey. Just remember what I said,
we’ll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can.
Doyle’s had a real hard life. It’s just about run him crazy I think.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ve had a real hard life, too, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you’re
gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here’s gonna get
some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I could shore use some. Thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey there Karl, can you come unload a
generator for me?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Karl, lift this thing down and carry it to the
back. It’s on the blink. We’ll have it for you in a day or two,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Y’ont us to he’p you there liftin’ that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a bulldozier.
Fix anything, too. He’s mentally retarded, but he’s a whiz on small
engines. Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hell, he didn’t just make the team, Coach
says he’s probably gonna start at end on defense. He’s a chip off the
old block. Ain’t you, Steve?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What you readin’?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Readin’ on this book on how to work carpentry.
I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I’ve
always been partial to wood buildin’s and cabinets and whatnot. These
drawin’s they got here don’t make no sense to me so far. Frank, which he
seldom You seem like yore tails a’draggin’ a might. You got somethin’
wrong with ye?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Seems like Doyle’s wormed his way back in.
Mama said he’s stayin’ over tonight and he’s talkin’ about movin’ in for
good. We ain’t ever gonna be happy. We’ll always be nervous, won’t we
Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon I know. I ain’t found no way
yet and I’m three or four times as old as you. Might be that’s just the
way folks is.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just
make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels
good to me when I imagine it.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Make believin’ always made me feel good too
from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Bill Cox is goin’ to a funeral for a Mister
Turner tomorrow and a closin’ up shop early.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’ll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither
one of us is no count it won’t make no difference.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You will? For sure?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ll be on teams, me and you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was
a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys
got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen
you over there follerin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re liable to win if we keep this up. For
somebody like you, you sure run fast.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, let’s kick off to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know you could of scored them three
touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing ’em over to me.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Them boys was tryin’ to pull me down pretty
hard.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re strong though. You let me make them
touchdowns so I’d feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It don’t matter to me about us losin’ does it
to you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It was fun, anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I wadn’t thinkin’ about nothin’ else just like
you told me I’d do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can we play ever’ Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: If I ain’t too stove up. I ain’t like you. I’m
old and give out. I’m proud of ye.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m ye boy.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I ain’t got no boy.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m ye oldest boy name Karl.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I ain’t got no boy.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They turned me aloose from the nervous
hospital. Said I was well.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox fixin’
lawnmowers and whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That grass out in the yard’s all growed up. I
figured I might cut it fer ye.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I told you, I ain’t got no boy, now get on
out from here and let me be.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I learned to read some. I’ve read on the Bible
quite a bit. I don’t understand all of it, but I believe I understand a
good deal of it. Them stories Mama and you told me ain’t in there. You
ort not to of done that to ye boy. I’ve studied on killin’ you. But I
don’t reckon they’s no reason fer it if all you’re gonna do is set there
in that chair. You’ll be dead soon enough I reckon and the world’ll be
shut of ye. kitchen and turns back to You ort not to of killed my
brother. He ort to have had a chance to grow up. Sometimes he would of
had fun.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Little feller.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What in the goddamn hell are you doin’? It’s
the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you want, hun?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I want to be baptized.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don’t
give a shit. Call a fuckin’ preacher, goddamnit! I can’t baptize
you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We’ll go to church and get you baptized,
tomorrow’s Sunday. You go on back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What are you doin’ with that damn hammer?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t rightly know. I just kindly woke up
a-holdin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How’d your baptizin’ go?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It went real good.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Well, that’s good. It’s about time to eat and
you know what I’m cravin’? Some of that take out chicken. Why don’t you
run get some of it, honey, for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Would y’all like that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes ma’am. I like a fried chicken leg.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All right, y’all gonna go with me?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do
men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You
go on.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll be back in a little bit then.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I really just wanted to git your mama out of
the house for a minute so we can have a talk. Y’all set down.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Now here’s the deal. Now that I’m gonna throw
my entire life away doin’ what I want to come live here with y’all, we
have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn’t
have any problems if it wadn’t for you. We’d never have a bad word
between us. But since you do exist, if I’m gonna be here as the head of
the household, we’ll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you
don’t speak unless you’re spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a
regular kid does. You’re a weird little shit. I don’t get you. So wake
up. Face what they call reality. We’re gonna be a family now. And it’s
my family. I’ll be payin’ the bills so you got me. But I ain’t your
daddy. You just treat me like I am. I’m the boss, okay. And the other
thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can’t have a normal family with
him livin’ in the garage and comin’ in the bedroom at four in the
mornin’ with hammers and shit. See?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said –</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Don’t hit that boy no more.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You shut up you, fuckin’ retard. Get your
shit and get out of here. That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember.
Reality, like I said. Don’t forget any bit of what I said to you and
we’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where are you goin’, Karl? Didn’t you want
some chicken and things?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: No ma’am. I’m a’goin’ off sommers.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, okay. I got you some.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Frank, he went off, too. He ain’t gonna be in
there when you get indoors.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where’d he go? What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go
in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don’t have to worry
yourself none.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All right then. Well, I’ll see you later. If
you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don’t get to see him all
day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’re a good mama to that boy. You care for
him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his
eyes, I’ve seen it. He wouldn’t know what to do without ye.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well thank you, hun. That’s real good of you
to say. I wouldn’t know what to do without him either.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’ve been real good to me, too. It ain’t
ever’body that’d make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that
boy has give me a good feelin’.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We sure like havin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Thank ye. I’m just getting around to tellin’
you, but I fixed your warshin’ machine.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, Karl. How’d you know to come out
here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I knowed you’d be here. What are you a-doin’
digging with that stob?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just diggin’. I ain’t ever gonna be happy
now. Not with that son of a bitch movin’ in for good. I wish me and you
and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we
went. He’s crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn’t
ever born.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m glad of it you was borned. I reckon I
ain’t gonna be there in the garage no more.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You have to Karl. You have to look out for
me. You don’t let that son of a bitch run you off.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’re just a boy. You ort not to use that
sort of language.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Karl, I ain’t tryin’ to say nothin’ bad about
you, but why don’t you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You’re older
than him. You’re strong, too. My daddy wouldn’t let him do that to me
and Mama.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That feller’s a whole sight meaner than me.
He’d just whup the tar out of me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, I guess so. I’m real tired, you know
that. A kid my age shouldn’t be tired of things.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I’m tired, too, Frank. If I ain’t around no
more, it don’t mean I don’t care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I
care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the
bat.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I care for you, too. But you’ll be around,
don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Hit don’t make no difference where I was to
be. We’ll always be friends. There ain’t no way to stop that. I aim for
you to have these books.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Maybe you can make more sense out of them than
I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t want to give away all your
books.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I aim fer you to have ’em.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin’
and you don’t know why?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve got a feelin’ today.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Reckon what kind of a feelin’?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Like something different. I don’t know.
You’re leavin’ ain’t you, Karl?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Will ye do somethin’ for me if I ast you
to?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know I would. Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Don’t go home tonight and stay with that
Doyle. He’s got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin’, too. Feels
like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and
mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to
that feller’s house. Your mama’s friend. I want you to give me your word
on it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. I give you my word. Is ever’thing gonna
be okay? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Ever’thing’s okay, boy. I kindly want to put
my arm around ye for a minute and then I’m gonna go on and leave
here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Karl!</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I ain’t a-stayin’. I need to ast you fer a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: This evenin’ I want you to go get Mizz
Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: What’s wrong? Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with
that drinkin’ and bein’ mean to folks. Will you give me your word you’ll
do it?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Well, sure, okay. He hasn’t hurt them, has
he?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Naw, not yet. I want ye to give this to Mizz
Wheatley. Hit ain’t much, but maybe there’s a little somethin’ to hep
out. Hits what I’ve earned fixin’ lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill
Cox.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay
here?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t reckon you have to go with women to be
a daddy to a boy. You’ve been real square dealin’ with me. The Bible
says two men ort not lay together. But I’ll bet you the Good Lord
wouldn’t send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call
it Hades. That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big
place. You take care of that boy.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where’s ever’body else? You seen ’em? I
thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: How does a feller go about gettin’ ahold of
the police?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Pick up the fuckin’ phone and call ’em, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What numbers do you punch?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I told you to get away from here, didn’t I?
I’m tryin’ to relax and look at TV. What are you doin’ with that piece
of iron? I swear to God you’re the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard
of.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I aim to kill you with it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police you push
911. You’ll need to tell ‘em to send an ambulance, too. Or a hearse. You
fuckin’ idiot. You’re gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Oh God! Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yes ma’am. I need the police over here at the
Wheatley house. I’ve killed somebody with a mower blade. Yes ma’am, I’m
right sure of it. I hit him two good whacks. That second time just plumb
near cut his head in two. Hits a little old yeller house right on the
corner of Marigold Street and some other street. They’s a red pickup
truck out front says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION on it. I’ll be a
settin’ here waitin’ on ye. Beside sendin’ the police, Doyle said you
might want to send a ambulance or a hearse. Thank ye.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: … on the third day I washed her. She wasn’t
very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept
for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short
attention span. I can’t say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth
in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a
minimum. I don’t really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the
talking. I guess that’s why I’m so fond of you. You’re so easygoing,
although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how
was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell
me what it was like.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: They was a boy. We made friends.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I bet you did. I was never bent that way.
I’m bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: It’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Well, it’s not too big in here, is it? I
feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I’m sure you have
plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details. Come on Karl,
who did you kill? Was it the boy?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Don’t say nothin’ about that boy.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Fact the bidness, don’t you say another word
to me. I ain’t listenin’ to you no more.</p>
