<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Here, lads, East Proctor and all about
are the moors. I go east here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, well thank you very much for the ride,
sir. You have lovely sheep.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the
road. Good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks again!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not having a good time are you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I mean look around. Isn’t
this a fun place?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, I like it here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry. Northern England first, Italy
later.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you think she’ll meet me in Rome?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person
with a good body.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the
great bodies of all time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She’s a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re talking about the woman I love.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m talking about a girl you want to fuck, so
give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, anyway, do you think she’ll be
there?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and
Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking
at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the
sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If you don’t stop, I’m going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have to make love to her. It’s very simple.
She has no choice really.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It just fascinates me that you can spend so
much energy on someone so dull.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It is impossible for a body like that to be
dull.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ve known Debbie what, since the eighth
grade? How many years of foreplay is that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She says she `likes me too much’.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Slaughtered Lamb?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else
would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s a wolf’s head.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else
would they have a severed wolf’s head on a spear as their symbol?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s not a spear. It’s a pike.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A severed wolf’s head on a pike as their
symbol.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, before we go in there I want you to
know that - no matter what happens to us - it’s your fault.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I assume full responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s very cold outside. May we come in?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you have any hot soup?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, do you have any coffee?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hot chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We’ve got spirits and beer. If it’s something
hot you want, you can have tea.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then you have some hot tea?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But I can heat some up for you if you’d
like.</p>
<p><strong>david &amp; jack</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice looking group.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen, at least it’s warm in here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s a five-pointed star.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe the owners are from Texas.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remember the Alamo?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He was joking. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Joking? I remember The Alamo. I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: She means in the cinema, that film
with John Wayne. Checkmate.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died
in it. It was very bloody.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Bloody awful if you ask me!</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the
one about the crashing plane?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, but we’re about to.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: You be quiet, woman, and let me
speak.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: All right, laugh then. I shan’t tell
it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, come on, tell us.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: No. You’ve had your chance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ask them what the candles are for.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You ask them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, that’s a pentangle, a five-pointed
star. It’s used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios
maintain it’s the mark of the wolf man.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I see. You want me to ask these people if
they’re burning candles to ward off monsters.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Oh, all right. There was this airplane
over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the
United Nations.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s very funny, that is.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go on, ask them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You ask them.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Here now, let me finish! So halfway
over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the
plane. So they heave out all the baggage, but it’s still too heavy. So
they chuck out the seats, but it’s still too heavy! Finally this Froggy
steps up and shouts “Viva la France” and leaps out. Then an
Englishman….</p>
<p><strong>dart players</strong>: Hear! Hear!</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: …steps up and shouts
<code>God save the Queen!' and leaps out. But the plane is still too heavy. So the Yank delegate from Texas steps up, shouts,</code>Remember
the Alamo!’ and chucks out the Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Remember the Alamo!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me, but what’s that star on the wall
for?</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: You’ve made me miss.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: I’ve never missed the board before.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack, we’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean? I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: There’s no food here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Apparently so.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You can’t let them go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How much do we owe you?</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Nothing, lads. Go, God be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Uh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Wait! You just can’t let them go!</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Go! And stay on the road. Keep clear of
the moors.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, well, thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Beware the moon, lads!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know. Let’s see if there’s an inn or
something up the road.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Beware the moon?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on, I’m freezing.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You can’t let them go.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Should the world know our
business?!</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: It’s murder then.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Then murder it is! It’s in God’s hands
now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That was weird. I guess leaving was the best
idea.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. Now that we’re out here and it’s
three degrees, I’m not so sure I wouldn’t rather face a blood- thirsty
mob.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, not quite a blood- thirsty mob.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you think was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe that pentangle was for something
supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I see and they were too embarrassed to talk
about it, because they felt so silly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Please don’t rain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Say, David….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m well aware of how pleasant the weather is
in Rome at the present time thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Santa Lucia…Santa Lucia.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Perhaps they’ll be safe in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: No one brought them here! No one
wanted them here!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You could have told them!</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Are you daft? What do you think they’d
say? They’d think us mad.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Did you hear it? We must go to them.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: I heard nothing.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Nor I.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Could be a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A coyote.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There aren’t any coyotes in England.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The Hound of the Baskervilles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pecos Bill.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Heathcliffe.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Heathcliffe didn’t howl.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, but he was on the moors.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s a full moon, `beware the moon’.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re lost.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit! David, what is that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on, where?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Anywhere! I think we should just keep
moving.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s moving.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s circling us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Plan?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s just keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s right, a lovely stroll in the moors.
Tra-la-la, isn’t this fun?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you think it’s a dog?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh shit. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and
let’s walk away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice doggie. Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Walk away, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking
away.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: See anything?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It sounds far away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not far enough. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll tell you when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well. I’m glad we…WHOAA!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You really scared me, you shithead.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Are you going to help me up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus fuck! David! Please help me! Please!
David! Shit! Help me! Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack? Oh my God, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack?!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Mr. Kessler?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Mr. Kessler?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: He all right?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, I should think. He called out just
now.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: He’s an American, you know.
Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Chart says he’s from New York.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: I think he’s a Jew.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why on earth do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: I looked.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Really, Susan, I don’t think that was very
proper, and besides, it’s common practice now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite
right.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute
ago.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform
some function here at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Then get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Can I be of service, Miss Price?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Hirsch?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Go about your duties.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Oh, Miss Price?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: What exactly did he call out?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He said `Jack’.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who
was killed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: The police report said an escaped
lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I
really don’t see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this
is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’re in a hospital in London.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: London? Where’s Jack? I had a strange
dream.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I should think so after your recent
traumatic experiences.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did
I get to London?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Now, David, I want you to prepare
yourself; your friend is dead.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ow, shit!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>mr. collins</strong>: Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins of the
American Embassy here in Grosvenor Square. Both Mr. Goodman’s parents
and your parents have been notified of your injuries and everything’s in
order.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Everything’s in order? What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>mr. collins</strong>: Mr. Goodman’s body has been
air-freighted back to New York for burial and your parents have wired
funds for your stay in the hospital until you are well enough to fly
home.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You don’t crate and ship Jack like some side
of beef. Who the hell are you people? What’s going on here? Where is
Jack? I demand to see him!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Miss Price! Miss Price, please!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell
is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. collins</strong>: I realize how upsetting this must be
for you, Mr. Kessler, but please try to refrain from hysterics.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss
Price.</p>
<p><strong>mr. collins</strong>: Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to excite
yourself. Everything has been arranged. I shall come back to check on
your progress and send a report to your parents. The police have
requested to interview you and I have given them permission to do
so.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr. Collins. He’ll
rest now and I’m sure everything will be fine once he’s adjusted. He’s
had quite a shock.</p>
<p><strong>mr. collins</strong>: These dumb-ass kids never appreciate
anything you do for them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How long have I been here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’ve been unconscious since you were
brought in two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’ve suffered some rather severe cuts
and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and
blue for a while. You’ll have some dueling scars to boast of. That
lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the
strength of ten.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Now we’ve just given you a pretty strong
sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your
needs. Rest now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It wasn’t a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was a wolf.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A wolf.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Did he say a wolf?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, I believe he did.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: But Roger is so terribly boring. Yes,
dear, but couldn’t we…I see. Thursday at eight, dinner with boring
Roger. Yes, I’m sure I will; if I survived Rommel, I suppose I’ll
survive another excruciating evening with Roger Mathison. Be a good
girl. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to
see you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Send them in.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Dr. Hirsch?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Come in, come in. Please sit. Some
tea?</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: It’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: No, thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Well, then, what can I do for Scotland
Yard?</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Has Mr. Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Excuse me. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Roger Mathison, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: What here?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He’s on the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Tell him I’m out. No, tell him I’ve
passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I’m dead. And no
more calls!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Has David Kessler anything to say
concerning the attack on the moors?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Why don’t we ask him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry if I conflict with your report, but
Jack and I were not attacked by a man.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: So you’ve said.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that
David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the
officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have
an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local
police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You’ll forgive me,
Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has
gone through a terrible shock.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: And what, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: That is precisely my point. David, as
far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won’t trouble you any
further. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There were witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: So they said.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How could there have been witnesses? It was
so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this
thing came from nowhere…I don’t understand what they’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: In time I’m sure it will all come back
to you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Doctor, my memory is fine. It’s my sanity I’m
beginning to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was having a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Yes, well these should help that.
That’s right, drink up.</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Now go back to sleep so you’ll be
fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: It’s nearly eight. I’m off duty
shortly, then I’m off to the films with Alex.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Alex?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Miss Price, the other nurse that
attended you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you going to see?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: An American film about the Mafia
called `See You Next Wednesday’, and I want to see it badly, so you give
me no problems and go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you have bad dreams, too?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Some, everyone does.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Bambi?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Kill Bambi?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Miss Price.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Take these round now, will you please?
The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he’s eaten.
Will you be sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Has he been refusing food?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss
Price. He just doesn’t eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers
from nightmares. I’d think he just needs a hand to hold.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hello, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, all right then, be that way. Here,
swallow this.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The doctor will be round later. Would you like
a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray
yet?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: The American? Yes, duck.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How did he look?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: What do you mean, `how did he look’?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think
he’ll eat the food?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: I’m an orderly, not a bleeding
psychiatrist! I push things about, but I’ve little say what happens to
them.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Mr. Kessler?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You haven’t eaten your lunch.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not very hungry, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m afraid you have to eat something.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Please, really. I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You put me in an awkward position,
Mr. Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How is that?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, you’re to take these after you’ve eaten.
Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as
giving out some pills?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Leave the pills. I’ll take them later.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Aw come on, Miss Price!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Call me Alex.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Aw come on, Alex!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shall I be forced to feed you,
Mr. Kessler?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Call me David.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shall I be forced to feed you, David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is absurd. I’m not hungry. I don’t want
any food.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let’s try a little harder, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you give me a break?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Will I have to take such drastic action again,
David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: May I have a glass of milk?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David! David! Please help me! Oh God! David!
Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Orderly! Miss Gallagher!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Orderly, go at once to twenty- one and
restrain the patient.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Miss Gallagher, remain here at the desk.
I’ll be in twenty- one.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’ve never had bad dreams before?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so
bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Did you get a good look at the man who
attacked you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve told you, it wasn’t a man. It was an
animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I’ve been
traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can’t do that to
someone with his bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’d be surprised what horrors a man is
capable of.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you see Jack?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned
and dressed before you arrived here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you talk to the police in East Proctor?
Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Then why the hell are you so quick to
disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength
to tear apart a person like that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: David, please. The police are satisfied.
I’m certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we’d
have seen it on the telly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You really think I’m crazy, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Believe me. The Hound of the
Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s. And if you’d
read the bloody book, you’d find that Holmes discovered your house of
hell a fraud, a fake.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Now really, David. You’re far too
intelligent to go on this way. When you return to America I want you to
seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop
this nonsense. You’ll be leaving this hospital in three or four days,
please remain sane. At least until you are no longer our
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dr. Hirsch? I’d rather not be by myself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Of course not, David. I’ll fetch in
young Miss Price.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re a very beautiful girl.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I thought you were asleep.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was. What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: `A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court’
by Mark Twain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve just started it. My friend gave it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What do you dream about?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I dream of death mostly.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s not really a very proper question.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Twenty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now what do you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Was Jack Goodman your good friend?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My best friend. My very best friend.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shall I read to you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What? Oh, yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court by
Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A
Word of Explanation. You all right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, go on.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick
Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk
about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his
marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his
company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people
will in the tail of the herd….</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: All right, all right! Hold your horses.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hello. You all right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry I woke you up.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t be silly. Can I get you something?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, thank you. Just keep me company for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s easy enough.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I keep having these really terrible dreams.
They are getting worse and I can’t seem to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, your dreams will stop. You’ll leave
England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m serious. You don’t know me and I know
nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Now, David, I said I would keep you company,
but I meant right here and now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you think about it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How did we get from your bad dreams to my
taking a holiday with a patient?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not just a patient – me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re being awfully forward, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Forgive me, I’m trying to cheer myself up and
an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Now I’m embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good. I thought for a moment I was the only
embarrassed one in the room.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Where were we in the book?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me see here.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Ah you’re up. Good morning and a good day
to you. We’ve quite a meal for you here this morning. Bacon, oatmeal,
orange juice, and toast with jam. Good stuff there. Now eat it up and
I’ll be back for the dishes when you’ve finished.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Please, sir, I want some more.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can I have a piece of toast?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get the fuck out of here, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is too much. I can’t handle this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m aware that I don’t look so great, but I
thought you’d be glad to see me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David! You’re hurting my feelings.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you
that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me?
Listen to me, I’m talking to a hamburger!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I
had to come.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to be buried in New York
someplace?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was
surprised at how many people came.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why should you be surprised? You were a very
well-liked person.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Debbie Klein cried a lot.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So you know what she does? She’s so grief
stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine’s bed.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rudy Levine the shmuck?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Life mocks me even in death.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m going completely crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, now I know this may be hard for you,
but I have to warn you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat
loaf?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m a grisly sight, it’s true; but I love you
and that’s why I’m here. You’ve got to know.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If you love me so much, Jack, you’ll realize
how disconcerting it is to share one’s breakfast with the living
dead!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We were attacked by a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not listening!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: On the moors, we were attacked by a
lycanthrope, a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Shut up, you zombie!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I
walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf’s curse is lifted.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s wrong with you? Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The wolf’s bloodline must be severed. The last
remaining werewolf must be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you be quiet?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s you, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You survived and now you shall continue the
curse.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you talking about? I won’t accept
this! Get out! God damit!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb
said? `Beware the moon.’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Stop it, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You’ve
got two days.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack, please go away. Please go away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll stalk the streets of London a creature
of the night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re talking like Boris Karloff! It’s movie
dialogue!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, please believe me. You will kill
people, David. You’ve got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It’s
our only chance.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nurse!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It’s
all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nurse! Oh God! Alex!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s cold, David, and I’m so alone. The undead
surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It’s boring! I’m lonely!
Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t cry, David.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Beware the moon, David.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David? David!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: A werewolf?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are you better now?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll let you know the next full moon.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be
all right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My friend Jack was just here.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Your dead friend Jack?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in
two days. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What do I think? You mean about the
possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from
dead friends?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was dreaming again?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I would think so.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah, I would think so, too.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Do you have a place to stay in London?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Closet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There is only one bed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, perhaps you’d like to watch the telly
while I take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Alex?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you be here in about fifteen
minutes?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, you don’t honestly believe that in
reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do
you really?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was awake and he was in my room.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I wasn’t hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tomorrow is the full moon.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s good, Alex. Reassure me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s all right, I know I’m being insane.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay, okay. I’m properly reassured!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is very reassuring. I’m feeling very
reassured.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not real.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t be an asshole, David. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay, you’ve seen me. Now go away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, I’m sorry I upset you yesterday, but
you must understand what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I understand all right. You’re one of the
undead and I’m a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get out of here, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You’ll
change, you’ll become….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A monster. I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You must take your own life now, David, before
it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack, are you really dead?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I think I’ve lost my mind. I think you’re not
real. I think I’m asleep and you’re a part of another bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You must believe me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the
full moon I’ll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The canines will be real. You’ll taste real
blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You’ll kill and make others
like me! I’m not having a nice time, David! Don’t allow this to happen
again! You must take your own life!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I will not accept this! Now go away!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is not pretend, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I will not be threatened by a walking meat
loaf!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, what’s wrong? I heard voices.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was just me, Alex. It was just me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: A drink for a very cold man?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hello, there. What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Campari and soda would do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sorry, love.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I suppose Guinness will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: A thousand thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Nasty bit of business with those two
young American boys.</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Yes, I’m sure that’s right. A few weeks
ago, the last full moon wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I mean that escaped lunatic. The one
that killed the boy. Wasn’t that near here?</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: And where are you from, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: London. Knight takes pawn.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, that’s been there for two hundred years.
We were going to paint it out, but it’s traditional, so we left it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I see. You’ve heard nothing about the
incident?</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: Incident?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: The murder?</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: Are you a police officer?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: No, no, hardly. I work in the hospital
where the Kessler boy was brought.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: He was talking about werewolves and
monsters and as I was near here I thought….</p>
<p><strong>dart player</strong>: You thought what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I thought I’d look into the boy’s
story.</p>
<p><strong>chess player</strong>: A story about werewolves - now really,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Would you like a game of chess?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me go now, you’ll make me late.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Do me an enormous favor?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Tell me that it’s silly of me to be
apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s silly of you to be apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Werewolves simply do not exist.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, do you want me to stay here
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah, I do, but go to work.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the
hospital, okay?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve left those pills for you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A doper werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m off. There’s food in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks a lot, dog.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: An American werewolf was found frozen to
death today in the heart of London, England.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What did I do, cat?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Snarl. Growl. Grrrr.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: `Moon River, wider than a mile I’m crossing
you in style, Someday….’</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an
Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How are we feeling tonight?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten
about the face and neck?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I thought not.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You sleep now and have sweet dreams.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin &amp; alex</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What? Christ! What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m burning up! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack!? Where are you now, you fucker!?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Help me! Somebody help me, please! Jack!!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Which one, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Number thirty-nine, but let’s go `round the
back.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on, we’ll give Sean a scare.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re crazy, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just now?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Here we are, Sean’s is the one….</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Sean, those hooligans are in the park
again.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Aren’t you ready yet? They’ll be here any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Something’s going on out there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Is Miss Price on duty this evening?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hobbs</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Miss Gallagher, do you know if Miss
Price has seen the Kessler boy since his release?</p>
<p><strong>miss gallagher</strong>: Uh, I don’t know if….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I
have.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Come to my office, Miss Price.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Is anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Sit down, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I was in East Proctor today.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Oh dear girl, your extracurricular
activities are of no consequence to me. I don’t give a damn who you
sleep with. I’m concerned about David.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: It’s a full moon. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: At my flat. I’m off at midnight and….</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: The number, Alex. Your number!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: He’s not there.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s not?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Alex, has David persisted in his
werewolf fantasies?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by
the death of his friend.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Has his friend appeared to him
again?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David says Jack comes to warn him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Warn him?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Hirsch, what’s wrong? Is this more serious
than I know?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I tried to investigate the attack. There
are no records. The case was closed and now they’ve `misplaced’ the
file. David’s lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here
and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy
is already in the ground so he’s no good to us. So I went to the pub in
East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: They were lying. There were no
witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth
of what actually happened up there.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And what else?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I think the village of East Proctor is
hiding some dark and terrible secret. I’m convinced that, like David,
they believe in this werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’ve absolutely no idea where David
might be?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I
shouldn’t have left him alone.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Surely you’re not suggesting….</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: David has suffered a severe trauma. I
myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the
villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why
shouldn’t David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a
werewolf, wouldn’t he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Hirsch?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Oh, I don’t mean running about on all
fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could
harm himself, or perhaps others.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What shall we do?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Let’s call the police and see if they
can help us find our wandering boy.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #1</strong>: Old Winston smells something.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #2</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>derelict #2</strong>: Let `im go.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #3</strong>: Brave dog that.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #1</strong>: Here - who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>derelict #2</strong>: That’s not Winston.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #3</strong>: Look there.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #1</strong>: Mother Mary of God.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Is there someone there?</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: I can assure you that this is not in the
least bit amusing!</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: I shall report this!</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Good Lord.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Wake me up, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hello? No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn’t come back
yet. Yes, I will, doctor, but I just feel so helpless sitting here doing
nothing. Thank you, yes, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Excuse me, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pssst!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, kid! Pssst. Little boy with the
balloons.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come over here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If you come over here, I’ll give you a
pound.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Two pounds?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Listen, two pounds is a lot of money. It’s
almost five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: I don’t know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m the famous balloon thief.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Why would a thief want to give me two
pounds?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come here and I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A little closer.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, love?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: A naked, American man stole my
balloons.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: A naked, American man – the famous
balloon thief.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I’ll have one of those, too.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A lot of weather we’ve been having
lately.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David! Where on earth have you been!?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m freezing.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Alex, I’ve lost my mind. I woke up at the
zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The zoo?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Waking up at the zoo, that’s not so insane.
Having no clothes on? That’s insane. What did I do last night, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of
the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I
started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my
fucking mind.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I worried about you. We didn’t know where you
were.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where did you get that coat?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Alex, have you heard anything?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Is he all right? Why didn’t you call me?
Where was he?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He doesn’t remember. He woke up at the
zoo.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: The zoo? Is he rational?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, he is. He’s very excited and confused,
but he’s not crazy, if that’s what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Have you read the papers today? Have you
listened to the radio or television?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Is David acting strangely?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Could you get here without any
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, I should think so.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Right. Now listen carefully. I want you
to bring David here. I want him in my care. I’ll notify the police that
we’ve found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the
hospital. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: You’re certain he’s lucid? You won’t
need any help?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s fine. We’ll come right over.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Shall I send a car?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, a cab will be faster.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I expect you shortly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Yes, Scotland Yard?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The next corner we can get a cab.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I should be committed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know why I feel so good. I haven’t
felt this good in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My body feels alive, alert. I feel like an
athlete.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Saint Martin’s Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: It’s like the days of the Mad Barber of
Fleet Street, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: The murders.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What murders?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Last night. Haven’t you heard? Six people in
different parts of the city mutilated. A real maniac this one.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, wait!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Six people mutilated? It had to be me,
Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, stop!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I am going to the cops. There’s a full moon
tonight. Jack was right. I….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Jack is dead!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jack is dead. Look, six people have been
killed. I’m going to the police.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, please be rational. Let’s go to
Dr. Hirsch.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rational!?! I’m a fucking werewolf, for
Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Officer, I killed those people last
night.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: You did, did you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s playing a stupid joke, sir.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We had an argument. He’s being silly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I swear, I don’t know this girl.</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: All right, you two, move along.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest
me!</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: There’s no call for that kind of
language.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a
faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: Now see here young man.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother
sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: That’s quite enough!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, please!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Who is this girl?</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: You’re going to have to stop this
disturbance or I shall arrest you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s what I want you to do, you moron!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sir, he’s very upset. His friend was killed
and….</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you shut up!?!!</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: That’s enough! Now go about your
business.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, David, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re not going to arrest me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t you think he should arrest me?</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: Well, I’m not sure. How does he know this
isn’t a prank?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A prank?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David….</p>
<p><strong>bobbie</strong>: I’ve no time for this foolishness. Nothing
to look at. Move along.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hopeless. It’s hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, let’s go now.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy!
I’ve got to get away from here! I’ve got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, don’t lose control.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Control!?! What control!?! Get away from
me!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David, wait!</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: The forensic lads seem to feel that
some sort of animal was involved, that’s true, but I hardly think….</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Regardless of what you think,
Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find
him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Gentlemen, please. We shall find
Mr. Kessler as quickly as we’re able.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He tried to have himself arrested. He….</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Getting arrested isn’t all that
difficult, Miss Price.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He wants help. He….</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: What can we do to assist you?</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: Stay here. If we need you, we’ll know
where to reach you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: I cannot accept a connection between
David Kessler and last night’s murders. We will find him, however. I can
assure you of that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What shall we do?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Tea would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, operator. I’d like to call the United
States and reverse the charges. David Kessler for anyone. Yes, I’ll
wait. Hello? Yes, area code 315/472-3402. Thank you. Hello? Rachel? Just
say yes, you’ll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel. Is Mom or Dad
home? Where are they? Where’s Max? You’re all alone? Mom and Dad
wouldn’t leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either.
I’m still in London. I’m all better. Look, would you tell Mom and Dad
that I love them? I don’t care, Rachel, just do it for me. Okay? Good.
And, Rachel, don’t fight with Max. Well, try. Look, kid, please don’t
forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them. I love Max and you, too. Well, I
do. No, I’m not being weird, you little creep. You promise? Okay. Be a
good girl. I love you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ticket lady</strong>: Two and a half quid, please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Will you take a traveler’s check?</p>
<p><strong>ticket lady</strong>: No, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>ticket lady</strong>: Well, thank you, sir!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hi, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What can I say, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t have to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Aren’t you going to say, `I told you so’?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I was still alive, I probably would.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You look awful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t mean it. I don’t know what I’m
saying. I’m not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don’t
remember doing it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about the zoo?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, even if I’m not the wolfman, I am crazy
enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square
talking to a corpse. I’m glad to see you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want you to meet some people.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway.
We thought it best you didn’t see him as he’s a fresh kill and still
pretty messy.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: Yes, I do look most unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you doing this to me, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: This isn’t Mr. Goodman’s idea. He is your
good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar
activities.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mr. Bringsly, I’m sorry. I have absolutely no
idea what to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: You’ve left my wife a widow and my
children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of
the living dead until the wolf’s bloodline is severed and the curse
lifted.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: You must die, David Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: David, this is Harry Berman and his fiancee
Judith Browns.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And these gentlemen are Alf, Ted, and
Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #2</strong>: Can’t say we’re pleased to meet you,
Mr. Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What shall I do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You must take your own life!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s easy for you to say - you’re already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: No, David. Harry and I and everyone you
murder are not dead. The undead.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because this must be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How shall I do it?</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: Sleeping pills?</p>
<p><strong>derelict #1</strong>: Not sure enough.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I could hang myself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you did it wrong, it would be painful.
You’d choke to death.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #3</strong>: So what? Let `im choke.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you mind? The man’s a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #3</strong>: Well he ain’t no friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: Gentlemen, please.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A gun.</p>
<p><strong>derelict #1</strong>: I know where he can get a gun.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t I need a silver bullet or
something?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Be serious, would you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Madness. I’ve gone totally mad.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A gun is good.</p>
<p><strong>judith</strong>: You just put the gun to your forehead and
pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>bringsly</strong>: If you put it in your mouth, then you’d be
sure not to miss.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you, you’re all so thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Go away! Please! Go away!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Run! Please…run.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: I’ll check on the house.</p>
<p><strong>ticket lady</strong>: It’s horrible, horrible! There’s a
beast! A mad dog! It’s killing people in there!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: For God’s sake, Tom, there’s a monster in
there!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Call for assistance and tell them to bring
guns.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Keep moving! Will you people get out of the
way!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Nurse Hobbs said there’s a disturbance
in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: I doubt it. But it’s something to
do.</p>
<p><strong>lt. villiers</strong>: What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: It’s some kind of animal, sir. We….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David! It’s David!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me through!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Stand clear, miss!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I must get through!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hirsch</strong>: Alex!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David? Is it you? Is it true, David?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Fire!</p>
