<p><strong>heather</strong>: You hear about your ex?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, asshole Jerry. He’s moving to
Middletown. He left this morning.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: No way. How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Carter said. He got some job at some
company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Doesn’t sound so bad.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I don’t want to go to a baseball game.
You’re going with Derek anyway.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, I don’t want to go either, but Derek
told Adam he’d go, and I’m not going by myself.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I thought Adam was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey! Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Finally!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Office hours are nine to five.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You have a lot of credit card bills in there,
Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You’re not mad that we’re stopping by like
this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s no big deal, but let’s hurry up. I gotta
go to work.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Jimmy’s got like, six jobs.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for
nothin’, but you know Buggerin’ Bobby Bales is askin’ about you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Askin’? Like how?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Like how you owe him money on the Dallas
fiasco, those chokin’ motherfuckers, and you haven’t been returnin’ his
calls.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How you hear this?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yesterday. I was puttin’ a twenty-timer on
Indiana for tonight, and he up and out- of-the-blue asks about you.
Jimmy, man. Goddam.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It ain’t nothin’. He’s just makin’
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It ain’t nothin’? That faggot juicehead’s
gonna make a playground outta your asshole like he’s back in the joint,
and it ain’t nothin’? And you heard all the stories I heard, about that
horse-cock, and how he can’t stop shootin’ his mouth off about it too,
like when he whipped it out at Tomlinson’s party…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a little,
shit, but I’ll pay. Believe me, that guy wants his juice, his e, he
comes to me. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. Alright, come inside and let’s do this
thing. I got work.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Maybe back in Mexico that’s a shower, in
Athens that’s just dirty.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: At least I’m paid to be here.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Emily?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: Some other girl would be calling
you?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: How’d you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: Don’t you work there?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: I need you to come pick me up.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Are you kidding? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: At home.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: Just because. I need to stay with you
for a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water.
Our phone just got shut off, too. You’d be miserable like us. What for
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: It’s no big deal. Just come pick me
up.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Fine, forget it then.</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: Corey, come on! How many times have I
called you since you left? I wouldn’t ask, except I don’t have anywhere
to go. Please.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay in our
little dump, fine.</p>
<p><strong>emily’s voice</strong>: Fine. Thanks, then.</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to be watching Katie right
now?</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Did you get my message?</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: You have one new message. Hi
Jess, it’s your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you’ll be
gone when I get home. I’m driving your sister to school and I’m leaving
the car for her, so I’ll be taking the train back.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: By the way, you should call your
sister and stop this not-talking nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Anyway, I know how you hate long
messages, so I’ll see you tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s fucking bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What about my car?!</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Jessica, your sister got into beauty school,
and she’s going. Now I’ve got about two hours sleep before I have to
drive her all the way the hell up there.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah, I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Jess, you’re still living here for free.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: On the couch!</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: Jessica, it’s still my car, and she needs it.
Can’t you be happy for your sister?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh yeah, I’m real happy. She gets my car,
and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a favor and tell her how fucking
happy I am for her.</p>
<p><strong>jina</strong>: If you’re going to be like this, I’m just
going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Hey Jimmy. You fix the lat machine?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>

longer than her!</p>

who pay me dues just ’cause she works here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But she doesn’t do anything! She just sits at
the front desk all day.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine,
she’ll look at you cross-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I can’t afford two employees, and she attracts
business. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fucking great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Jimmy, don’t take it personal. If you were
built like her I’d keep you.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Bales.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So where you been?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are you talkin’ about? Nowhere. I been
working.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: So you just don’t return my phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so
what? I’ll pay you. I want to put it on Indy tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I can’t take any more of your bets. I look
like a spineless fucking fag.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What the hell am I supposed to do with you
Jimmy? People are talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know they’re talkin’!</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You don’t know what I know. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m working tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jimmy, I ain’t about beggin’. I’m lookin’
like a fool all on account ‘a you. You owe me. You owe me. I’m gettin’
sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: She fainted.</p>
<p><strong>lifeguard</strong>: Alright, I’m calling 911. Everybody stay
out of the pool.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alright, well, quit horsing around. The
Blandino’s had a break-in. There’s glass all over the patio.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: That’s Jerry’s unit.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Jerry moved to Middletown.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: He quit?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He left a message. You gotta take care of all
his stuff now, too.</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s letting me borrow it.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Well then why were you late if you had his
car?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I slept late.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Were you drinking last night?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No. But thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Were you doing drugs?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Katie, I told you, drugs are for
losers.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: And you’re not a loser.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And neither are you.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But it’s okay to drink.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: When you’re older it’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Old enough.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But you’re not twenty-one yet. The law says
you have to be twenty-one.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Katie, can you not ask so many questions
today? I’ve got too much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Cause it’s your birthday?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did you see her eat anything?</p>
<p><strong>lifeguard</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know her.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yeah? How?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked
him.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: She started dating Steve right after we
broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and
he never answered. He couldn’t answer, because he was fucking that
slut.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: That doesn’t mean they fucked.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Alright, she ain’t comin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Whoa, easy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We’ll get there.</p>

with Steve!</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Just for a minute. I left my novel at
Aaron’s.</p>

just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I’m
done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her
big sister.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Don’t know why you wanted another sister

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, it’s Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Hey Jimmy, it’s Matt. I need some K.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Matt?! Speak up, man, I can barely hear

<p><strong>matt</strong>: I need some K, dude. I need it for

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?!</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alright, alright! I got it, man, got plenty!

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Jimmy? Hey, what’s up, man?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit, Dave, sorry ‘bout that. I was talkin’
on the phone. I didn’t see the stop sign, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Don’t sweat it. I could give a shit about this
thing. I was hopin’ some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin’ hit me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Holy shit, man, is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She’ll be alright. You didn’t hit us that hard
- it’s gotta look worse than it is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’re you, a fuckin’ doctor? We need ta get
her to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Fuck that, you’ll have all kinds ’a problems
if we do that. Cops, insurance and whatnot. You probably got drugs on
you…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Dave, look at her fuckin’ head! She’s
bleedin’ all over the place!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Just give her a minute, she’ll snap out of it.
She’s a stripper, for god-sake.</p>

<p><strong>dave</strong>: Put that shit away. I’ll take her home and
give her some K, she’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She needs a doctor. What the hell’s K gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Jimmy, listen, she’s gonna be fine. A guy like
you should be avoidin’ that kinda’ attention.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You should take better care of your girl.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Bro, she ain’t my girl. She plows through all
my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She’s a whore.</p>
<p><strong>female passenger</strong>: Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: See, she’s fine.</p>

percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin’ nuts, pissin’ all
my money away.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sellin’ drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You want it?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Look, I’m definitely interested in a little
bit for myself, definitely, but I ain’t no dealer like you. Lemme think
about it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, your nose is bleedin’.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, just horsin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Listen, I gotta get going. Patch her head up

<p><strong>corey</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Everybody knows my brother does drugs.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: So you heard about that thing that
happened?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Yeah. Everybody knows about that, too.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: If you think so highly of me, what the hell
are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I’m just saying. Why’d you try to put
everything back in the house?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: We ran outta of gas. We were right outside
his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn’t
supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on
us.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Here, I brought this.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Dad gave it to you, remember? You left it. I
brought it for you.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Keep it. I don’t wear hats.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: You go to see him at all?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: In prison? No, not lately.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: So what’s the problem? Vincent hitting
you?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Vincent? Vincent’s gone. She’s on Victor
now.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: What happened to Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: He found out about Victor.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Vamos, I need the address! I have a pen in
the truck!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: So is Victor hitting you or what?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Hurry up, mehn!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You know he has porno magazines all over his
truck.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s a moped.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Just lay off it.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Gracias.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Oye, don’t get mad, but would you be mad if I
try to fuck your sister?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: If you think you can.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Maybe you think you can talk to her for
me?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Pedro, she’s fifteen!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: No way, mehn. No con esas tetas.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: I’ll have you sent to jail, man. I’m
serious.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: No way she is fifteen. She looks way
older.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: She’ll look a lot younger on the witness
stand, with my mom sitting in the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Bueno, tell her I say good-bye. I call you
soon.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: So what’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: I’m gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say, “Look,
mehn, let us into our fucking home.”</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Wait a second… Why are you still driving this
thing? I thought you got fired.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna drive
without my truck. They fired me, mehn.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I hate this job.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I should pick up one of them assholes.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Don’t you have an appointment with
Dr. Cook?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Five-thirty, and I’m not missing it.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Derek probably thinks you’re sleeping with
your doctor. There’s nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: portion of her right</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s her. Tess.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You’re just guessing.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, I know that’s her. That’s his type,
too. That little slut.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Harry’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Sorry if I snapped.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You didn’t snap.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I mean this morning.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Oh. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m just afraid its gonna be the whole
thing all over again with Derek, and then I’ve got to find some other
asshole, and do it all again. I’m sick of the whole cycle.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: So do something different.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m trying, but he’s fucking it all up.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>carlos’ voice</strong>: Right down the street, gettin’ some
more nachos.</p>

<p><strong>pedro</strong>: I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. carson</strong>: Margaret wants you out of the house
anyway. Now let my car down.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: You need some balls, mehn! Why do you let her
slap you around?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. carson</strong>: Nobody slaps nobody around.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay rent, I

<p><strong>matt</strong>: This is fuckin’ extortion! Knowin’ I’m meetin’
this chick, so you jack up the price!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin’ way

ten over the regular price, or twenty-five over your fuckin’ “discount
price,” but you’re payin’ sixty bucks for this jar.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Man, what the hell. I need some cash for food
and drinks, man! I’m takin’ this girl out!</p>

morning. Why didn’t you call our cells when you got here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why didn’t I call. Good question.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: What the fuck do I care, you think it’s a good
question?! Are you fucking kidding me?!</p>

<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Why don’t we go to the doctor and get you

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I can go to the doctor by myself. And if I

<p><strong>heather</strong>: I don’t need a head doctor!</p>
<p><strong>dr. cook</strong>: I was just kidding there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cook</strong>: Heather, if you’re going to insist on
ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Can’t I be concerned about my health?! Is
that so outrageous?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. cook</strong>: Heather…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I just don’t want to be walking around
tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me
weird or paranoid…</p>
<p><strong>dr. cook</strong>: Heather, there’s nothing wrong with being
concerned about your health. Please put your blouse back on.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cook</strong>: So I’ll see you next week then.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay, yeah, see you next week.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I’m two pounds heavier I think.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was
kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather… like it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She never let’s me do it.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: She doesn’t? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. She does shave though. How come
you don’t shave?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t want to. Do you love
her?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: How can you not know?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She’s got problems.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I don’t understand you. Why do you even
cheat on her with me? She’s so pretty. So much prettier than me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She’s a nutcase. I’ll tell you what, I don’t
know why you do it. You should have a man of your own - we say it all
the time, me and Heather.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather
introduced me to last time?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: He outranks me. He’s a good guy.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Like me, I’m a good girl, and the best I
can do is a guy that looks like that?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You must think so. You tried to set me up
with him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I thought it was a bad match. It was
Heather’s idea.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: So she thinks I can’t do better.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You know what she thinks better than me.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Let’s get dressed, she’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Let’s let her walk in on us, and look
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>pizza pop</strong>: Hey-a Jimmy. Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Around. Deliverin’.</p>
<p><strong>pizza pop</strong>: Hurry - sit down Anna eat something. We
got more deliveries for you.</p>
<p><strong>pizza pop</strong>: Poppy’s!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Did your parents call?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Nope! Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Out with Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: The VCR is broken.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: ’Los, are you hungry?!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Are we going to have TV dinners all
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No. I promise. You want some milk?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Can I have ice-tea?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Of course. Can you make her some
ice-tea?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Aren’t you gonna eat?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m gonna take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Are you Jessica’s new boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I wish you were. I don’t like Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Don’t you like Jessica?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Kind of, I guess. She’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Take a look at that paper. There’s at least
a half dozen apartments I circled that would be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah? You’re joking. Alright, ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: of the call, completely</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That was Tess. Said I had to come back
in.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Are you fucking Tess?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What? No. Look, I gotta go. I’ll see you at
Carter’s when I get off.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m not dropping this!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Since when do you drop anything?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You see that? He practically said yes.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m gonna look through his shit.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You’re finally flipping, I think.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re a lot of help, Ally. Really.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: See?! See?!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: So what. Condoms.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, I’m on the fucking pill. He hasn’t
used condoms with me for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: So maybe those are left-overs.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, these are not left-overs. He never
used regular condoms with me.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Because if he did, he took two fucking days
to come. I always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: He took too long for you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, I’d be done, and I’d have to lie
there like another hour ’till he got off. I couldn’t fucking stand it.
Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that
hormone shit in my body.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: How would I know?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well that’s why. Anyway, that’s neither
here nor fucking there. That asshole is using</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Just call him and ask him.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, no, fuck that. We’re going to go to the
party, have some fun. When he’s all good and drunk, you’re going to ask
him when I’m not around.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, I’m serious. If he’s drunk and having
fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He’ll
never admit shit to me.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: He won’t to me either.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally! Just fucking try it!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I don’t wanna spy on him for you!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Ally, look, he’s cheating on me, I know it
in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright? Before I fucking flush
what’s left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, I want him to
admit it.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Fine, I’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Hey, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s up.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: I’m just looking for my stuff. Let’s take a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Your place.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can’t do it ’til after work.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: You’re sitting here on your ass!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I gotta eat. I’m going back to work now. My
boss needs me - I’m the only delivery guy.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Is that your piece-of-shit out front?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Let’s check that out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I told you, I ain’t got your shit.</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is a
suspect!</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: Fuck that. Let’s look in your car.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, it’s Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey man, it’s Dave. I got happy news for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You want the juice?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I told ya, I got plenty. But about the other
stuff, I been thinkin’ ‘bout your problem, and I know a guy who could
help you out. Buy a lot a’ your shit all at once.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The juice?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No, no. I’m talkin’ ‘bout the coke an’ shit. I
might know somebody.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some
fake D-ball once. I tied his brother’s dog to my front bumper and we
talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he’s
definitely lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For how much?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Well, he’s pretty small time, but he’s itchin’
to move up a few notches.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s got money?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: He talks so much shit it’s hard to tell. You
need to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gimme his number, man.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Kwon, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kwon</strong>: When you off work?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t know. Maybe nine or nine-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>sinjin’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is this Sinjin?</p>
<p><strong>sinjin’s voice</strong>: Yeah, who’s this?</p>

<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Ah, el Mustang?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: That’s our rent, mehn. We stole it.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Hey, uh-uh, no way! I didn’t steal
anything!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Don’t worry. We’re going to sell it,
mehn.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Seriously, are you out of your mind? To
who?!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: This guy I know.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: How do ya know he’ll even buy it?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Don’t worry. He likes Mustangs, mehn. Vamos,
I got a place for us to stay.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Jesus, Pedro! I told you I wanna stay out of
trouble! I mean, this is big trouble!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: No jodas, don’t worry about it. I stole it.
But we need rent, mehn. I lost my job.</p>

<p><strong>corey</strong>: Hey, Emily! Get your stuff!</p>

<p><strong>carter</strong>: Stay outta my room.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Wanna shot?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Later. I wanna see how crazy it gets.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Skirt.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I can’t believe you’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Ya think it’s a good idea we leave it out
here on the street like this?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Forget about that, mehn.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Hey, Pedro, what’s up with the Mustang?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Que? Ah, el Mustang?</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Nada. I’m doing a favor for a friend.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: So you’re driving around with his car
hitched to your tow truck?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Bueno, he’s a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Sounds good. Come on an’ grab a beer.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Kimmock’s got couch.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Come on, mehn, we’re in trouble here. We got
thrown out of our home.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: You got evicted?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my
dog, I come back, my keys don’t work, and the cocksucker put an eviction
notice on the door. He didn’t even tell us! Now my milk’s spoiling in my
truck, Pancho’s probably pissing all over the place, I’m fucked.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in
Jerry’s room. He moved out.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Don’t park there. Park in back.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Si, si. No problem, mehn.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: What’s up, Becker.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Did you know he was having a party?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wait here a second and let me talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Those were Jerry’s anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh. You didn’t tell me that. Is he
pissed?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Who gives a shit? He moved out.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I gotta wash my hands.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s Aaron, that asshole. He’s pissed at
me.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So what am I, a goddam marriage
counselor?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, but Aaron hit me, and he’s gonna do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He hit you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Like, he slapped you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch
’a times.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why? What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I didn’t do shit.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Look, I ain’t gonna sit here all night. Tell
me what happened. None ’a your bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Aaron thinks I cheated on him.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why’s he think that?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Alright, alright. He caught something - he
got a rash or something. He says I gave it to him.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s got a rash?! Are you fuckin’ kiddin’
me?! What the hell’d he catch?! Fuckin’ herpes?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Carter!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What the hell’d you give him?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Nothing! He’s fulla shit! I did not cheat
on him!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Fuckin’ A! You slept with me, like, three
weeks ago!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That was the only time, that once, and
there’s no way he knows.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And you have something?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No! Are you fucking listening to me?! And
you wore a condom anyway! What the fuck do you care!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever. And I’m
sure I’m the only one.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Look, don’t even get into the cheating
thing, ‘cause you’re seein’ Rachel still. Don’t call me the slut.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Look, I’m not gettin’ into it with you. I’m
through with that bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron.
Just help me this one last time, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s probably gonna be here tonight,
Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You’re kidding. You barely even know who he
is!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No, but I know Troy real good. He said he’d
be bringin’ him. I ain’t got nothin’ against Aaron, so I said “what the
hell.”</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Look, can you just kick his ass for me?
Please?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Shit, Jess, I don’t wanna be fightin’ no
friend ’a Troy’s. Can’t you just work this shit out?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with
pepper spray!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Look, if he tries anything tonight, I’ll do
something.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’ll you do?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Whadda you mean what’ll I do?! I’m gonna
dance with him! Fuckin’ I’ll beat his ass! I don’t wanna, but if he
shows up tonight and makes like he’s gonna hit you, I’ll beat his
ass.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What if he doesn’t come?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Troy said he was bringin’ him. If he
doesn’t, call him or somethin’. But I’m not a fuckin’ bounty hunter
whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Alright, fine.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hey, there he is! Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thirty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I only got ten.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t believe this shit.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You got nine! Jesus Christ! You knew what you
asked for!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Jimmy, relax. My God.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, this is fuckin’ ridiculous. What’d you
call me for? I ain’t runnin’ a goddam soup kitchen here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Can’t you just take care of us for
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, for thirty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Here then, take nine for one.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s ten.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You know what? You need to get laid, Jimmy.
Maybe you’d relax a little.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fine. Enjoy your night.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well I’m not going to drop to my knees for
a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>katie’s voice</strong>: Watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Did your parents call?</p>
<p><strong>katie’s voice</strong>: Yeah. I told them you were in the
shower.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Okay… good. Thanks. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>katie’s voice</strong>: Oh, hold on! This is my favorite
part!</p>
<p><strong>katie’s voice</strong>: Can you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah, I can hear it. Katie?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: I don’t know about leaving the car out there
in the open like that. You think we should, like, hide it somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Co�o ya! Don’t take this the wrong way, mehn,
but you’re like a girl. Bitch, bitch, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Somebody could see it out there!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Si, si. Does your pussy hurt?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: I’m serious, Pedro!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Who’s gonna see it out there by the
woods?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Everybody who reads tomorrow’s paper.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Shut up Emily.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No, you shut up! Do you know how embarrassing
you are?!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Look, it was bad luck as usual. So what?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: The car ran out of gas in the driveway!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: The gage was busted!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Everybody at school makes fun of me!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: And it was way down the block anyway.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: And then you try to put everything back! I
mean, God, how stupid can you be?!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Just shut up, alright?! ’Cause you don’t know
shit about anything!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: The Herald had a picture of the owner
laughing at you!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Listen, I’m sick of your shit!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Get off me! You fucking loser!</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>rj</strong>: You’re Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re Sinjin?</p>
<p><strong>rj</strong>: RJ. Sinjin said you’d be wearin’ a bookbag.
They’re back here.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hey.</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Talking to Carter.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Is he gonna help?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He said he would.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Look. Wanna shot?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: You want me to talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Si. So let’s go fix the tire on the
Mustang.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You wanna play?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s dickhead doing? I knew he was
lying.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This is your best card?</p>
<p><strong>card player</strong>: I ain’t happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Shut up and drink, asshole. I should call
him.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: He said he’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He’s probably got that Tess on all fours,
fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is. No, you’re right,
fuck him. Drink. Fucking everyone drink.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Sinjin!</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: Mr. Pizzaman! What’s up?</p>
<p>****: Got any calzones in there?</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: It’s harder than it looks.</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: Sit down, man, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>rj</strong>: Yo, door don’t lock.</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin’
ass outside then, ‘cause ain’t nobody comin’ in here.</p>
<p><strong>rj</strong>: I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: Alright. Jimmy, sit down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I like to stand usually.</p>
<p><strong>sinjin</strong>: Alright. I’m Sinjin. That legless waste is
Louie.</p>

<p><strong>female partygoer 1</strong>: Excuse me.</p>

<p><strong>corey</strong>: Go find Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Take it easy. You got to go back and watch
Katie.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t remind me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You signed up for it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It seemed like a good idea then! Give some
crappy advice every once in a while. I didn’t think it’d be this
constant torture, always wanting to do something, go somewhere. I’m so
sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Some big sister.</p>
<p><strong>berubi</strong>: Shut the door!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Hey! Fuck… you! I would never!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Alright, alright! You little slut! I got
one for you! Right over there in front of the door!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well, he’s got a nice body. He’s a little
scary looking … he scares me.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You like it, too, you little slut!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Whatever! You’re the slut!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No! No! Alright, okay, yeah! Maybe! Bring
him a drink!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, Ally, this one is for me. You take that
