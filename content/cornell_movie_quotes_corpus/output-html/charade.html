<h1 id="charade">charade</h1>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Oh, la.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t tell me you didn’t know it was loaded.
Sylvie!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Isn’t there something constructive he can do
– like start an avalanche?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Va jouer, mon ange.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: When you start to eat like this something is
the matter.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Sylvie – I’m getting a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: �a alors! From Charles?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He’s the only husband I’ve got. I tried to
make it work, I really have – but –</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know how to explain it. I’m just too
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: It is infuriating that your unhappiness does
not turn to fat!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: But why do you want a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Because I don’t love him.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: But that is no reason to get a divorce!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: With a rich husband and this year’s clothes
you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired
of American Provincial,</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Does this belong to you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s hers. Where’d you find him, robbing a
bank?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was throwing snowballs at Baron
Rothschild. We don’t know each other, do we?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why, do you think we’re going to?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know – how would I know?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m afraid I already know a great many
people. Until one of them dies I couldn’t possibly meet anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, of course. But you will let me know if
anyone goes on the critical list</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Quitter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You give up awfully easy, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a walk. I
have never seen a Rothschild before.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Clever fellow – almost missed me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m afraid you’re blocking my view.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry. Which view would you like?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The one you’re blocking. This is the last
chance I have – I’m flying back to Paris this afternoon. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Peter Joshua.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m Regina Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is there a Mr. Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, it isn’t. I’m getting a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Please, not on my account.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, you see, I don’t really love him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, you’re honest, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, I am – I’m compulsive about it –
dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not sure I –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, you go in and you ask for some
toothpaste – the small size – and the man brings you the large size. You
tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the
small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he
says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all
larger than the large size – that the large size is the smallest size
there is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is there a Mrs. Joshua?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, but we’re divorced.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That wasn’t a proposal – I was just
curious.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is your husband with you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it
was separate rooms – now we’re trying it with cities. What do people
call you – Pete?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mr. Joshua. Well, I’ve enjoyed talking with
you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Now you’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I’m not – I’ve got some packing to do.
I’m also going back to Paris today.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh. Well, wasn’t it Shakespeare who said:
“When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again”?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shakespeare never said that.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s terrible – you just made it up.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, the idea’s right, anyway. Are you
going to call me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you in the book?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Charles is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is there only one Charles Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Lord, I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: When you get your divorce will you be
going back to America?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: He knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t you want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Yes, of course – but if you went back
and wrote me a letter –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: – you could have the stamps. I’ll get you
some here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Honorine – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Charles – !</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Madame Charles Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of
the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me,
please?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre’s voice</strong>: Well, Madame – ?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre’s voice</strong>: You are positive?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: You loved him?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m very cold.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: We discovered your husband’s body lying
next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed
only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished
to leave France?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Leave?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Your husband possessed a ticket of
passage on the ‘Maranguape.’ It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this
morning at seven.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m very confused.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: He was American?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Swiss.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Oh. Swiss. His profession?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He didn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: He was a wealthy man?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know. I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: About how wealthy would you say?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Where did he keep his money?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Besides yourself, who is his nearest
relation?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: C’est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment
absurde!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I know. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: It is all right.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Is it all right?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Les effets de Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: On Wednesday last your husband sold the
entire contents of the apartment at public auction. Furniture, clothing,
kitchenware – everything. The gallery, in complying with his wishes,
paid him in cash. One million two hundred and fifty thousand New Francs.
In dollars, a quarter of a million. The authorities in Bordeaux have
searched his compartment on the train. They have searched it thoroughly.
They did not find $250,000, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment. There was no other baggage. Your husband must
have been in a great hurry.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: One wallet containing four thousand
francs – one agenda – – his last notation was made yesterday – Thursday
– “Five p.m. – Jardin des Champs- Elys�es” Why there?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know. Perhaps he met somebody.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Obviously. One ticket of passage to
South America – one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: A letter? May I see it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: “My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying
your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass
very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your
dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed.” Not very
much, is it?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: We took the liberty of calling your
dentist – we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Yes. Your appointment has been changed.
One key to your apartment – one comb – one fountain pen – one toothbrush
– one tin of tooth powder – that is all.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: If you will sign this list you may take
the things with you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is that all? Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: One more question. Is this your
husband’s passport?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And this? And this?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Have you nothing to say, Madame?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s all right if you want to smoke your
cigar now.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to
tell you how sorry I am – and to find out if there was anything I could
do.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s in all the afternoon papers. I’m very
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I rang the bell but I don’t think it’s
working.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes it is – I heard it this morning.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: They must have turned off the
electricity.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where did everything go?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Charles sold it all – at auction.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you know what you’re going to do?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m a simultaneous translator – like Sylvie,
only she’s English to French – I’m French to English. That’s what I did
before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Instant divorce you mean?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Something like that. But I’m sorry it ended
like this – tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on. You can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know where to go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll find you a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Not too expensive – I’m not a lady of
leisure anymore.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Something modest but clean – and near enough
to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains – okay?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I loved this room – but Charles never saw it
– only what was in it. All those exquisite things – I think I prefer it
like this.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s not exactly what I’d call a large
turn-out.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Didn’t Charles have any friends?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t ask me – I’m only the widow. If
Charles had died in bed we wouldn’t even have him.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: At least he knows how to behave at
funerals.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Have you no idea who could have done it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Until two days ago all I really knew about
Charles was his name – now it turns out I didn’t even know that.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’ve never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: He must have known Charles pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: He’s allergic to him.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Ariva durchy, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Miz Lampert, ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Miz Lampert, ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way.
He sure didn’t. No siree.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t understa–</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Merci, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Pas du tout, madame, pardon – pardon –
pardon.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Who is it from?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The American Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: What is it about?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know. But if this is a sample of
American diplomacy I’m buying a fallout shelter.</p>
<p><strong>1st diplomatic type</strong>: I bluffed the Old Man out of
the last pot – with a pair of deuces.</p>
<p><strong>2nd diplomatic type</strong>: What’s so depressing about
that?</p>
<p><strong>1st diplomatic type</strong>: If I can do it, what are the
Russians doing to him?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hello – ? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Is there anything wrong, Miss
Tompkins?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Uh – Miss Tompkins isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I’m sorry – my secretary must have gone
to lunch. You are – ?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mrs. Lampert – Mrs. Charles Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You’re quite
late.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert –
it’s a stubborn little devil.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled
up. I had a good man – an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q.
asked us to use the plant here in the building – to ease the gold
outflow.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – are you sure you know who
I am?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Charles Lampert’s widow – yes? Last
time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Voil�! As they say.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Have some, please. I’ve got…
…liverwurst – liverwurst – chicken and – liverwurst.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Do you know what C.I.A. is,
Mrs. Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t suppose it’s an airline, is it?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Central Intelligence Agency –
C.I.A.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You mean spies and things like that?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Only we call them agents.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: We? You mean you’re –?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert
–</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just that I didn’t think
that you people were supposed to admit –</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I’m not an agent, Mrs. Lampert – I’m an
administrator – a desk jockey – trying to run a bureau of overworked men
with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs
–</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Agent.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Yes – That all he needs is a code book
and a cyanide pill and he’s in business.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What’s all this got to do with me,
Mr. Bartholomew?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Your husband was wanted by the U. S.
government.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: May I have a sandwich, please?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: To be more specific, he was wanted by
this agency.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: So that was it.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Yes. We knew him, of course, by his
real name.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: His – real – ?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Voss – Charles Voss. All right,
Mrs. Voss – – I’d like you to look at this photograph, please – by the
way, you saw this one, didn’t you? Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Aren’t they? Now look at this one,
Mrs. Voss, and –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Stop calling me that! Lampert’s the name on
the marriage license.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Yes – and tell me if you recognize
anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: It’s Charles!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: He looks so young – when was this
taken?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: 1944. The next face,
please.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: It’s the man who came to the funeral
yesterday – I’m sure of it – a tall man in a corduroy suit and string
tie.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Does the name Tex Penthollow
mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Next, please.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: Yes – and he was there, too – a
little fatter now – and less hair – but it’s the same one.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Do you know him, Mrs. Vo –
Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: The last one, please.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: That’s a face you don’t forget – he
was there too –</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew’s voice</strong>: Herman Scobie. And you’ve never
seen him before, either?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: No, thank heaven.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Mrs. Lampert, I’m afraid you’re in a
great deal of danger.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Danger? Why should I be in any danger?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: You’re Charles Voss’s wife – now that
he’s dead you’re their only lead.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – if you’re trying to
frighten me you’re doing a really first-rate job!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert –
it’s your only chance.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Gladly, only I don’t know what you want! You
haven’t told me.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Oh, haven’t I? The money – Mrs. Lampert
– the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those
three men want it, too – they want it very badly.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But it’s Charles’s money, not theirs.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I’d love to see you
try and convince them of that! Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Then whose is it? His or theirs?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Ours.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: And I’m afraid we want it back.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: That’s impossible. You’re the only one
who could have it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry it’s impossible. It’s the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Oh, you’ve got the money all right –
you just don’t know you’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – if I had a quarter of a
million dollars, believe me, I’d know it.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert – you’ve got
it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You mean it’s just lying around someplace –
all that cash?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Or a safe deposit key, a certified
check, a baggage claim – you look for it, Mrs. Lampert – I’m quite sure
you’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Look for it, Mrs. Lampert – look just
as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time.
Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won’t be safe
until the money’s in our hands. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Here’s where you’re to call me – day or
night. It’s a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don’t lose
it, Mrs. Lampert – and please don’t tell anyone about coming to see me.
It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Wait a minute – you think those three men
killed Charles, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: We’ve no proof, of course, but we
rather think so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, there you are! Charles had the money
with him – so whoever killed him has it – they have it!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Because they’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Like I said, Mrs Lampert – I’m afraid
you’re in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Reggie – ?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hallo, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You telephoned me to meet you. I’ve been
standing on the corner back there – waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry – I heard the children
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t you understand French?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m still having trouble with English.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The man and the woman are married –</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Yes, I can see that – they’re batting
each other over the head with clubs.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Who’s that with the hat?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: That’s the policeman – he wants to
arrest Judy for killing Punch.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: What’s she saying now?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: That she’s innocent – she didn’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: She did it, all right – take it from
me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: I believe her.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: Punch, of course.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course? I thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He’s only pretending, to teach her a lesson
– only – only he is dead, Peter – I saw him – he’s not pretending.
Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wish you’d let me help you. Whatever it is,
it doesn’t sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by
herself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Have you got a mirror? Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right there, between your eyes – see? Worry
lines. You’re much too young and too pretty to have anything like that.
How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Starting tonight?</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good evening
ladies and gentlemen, guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren – ce soir,
comme tous les soirs, l’attraction ici, au Black Sheep Club, c’est vous!
Venez, mesdames et messieurs, step right up, ladies and gentlemen,
kommen Sie her, meine Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e signori –
avanti!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What was all that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Fun and games. Evidently we’re the
floorshow.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean you and me?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, everyone. Come on – avanti, avanti!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: �coutez bien – les r�gles sont tres simples –
the rules are very easy – deux �quipes – two teams – each with one
orange – une orange – eine apfelsine – un’ arrancia – held under the
chin, like so – comme �a – and passed to the player behind you – sans
vous servir de vos mains – using nothing but the chin – no hands – and
keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor. Commencez,
Mesdames et Messieurs – begin, ladies and gentlemen – signore e signori,
comminciate!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: En garde.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Lay on, MacDuff.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Mrs. Lampert –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Didn’t Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: It doesn’t belong to you, Mrs. Lampert – you
do know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake
up dead.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Leave me alone – !</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Dead, Mrs. Lampert – like last week’s news –
like Charles, Mrs. Lampert –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Reggie – what’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He – he was stepping on my foot.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Forgive me – it was quite unintentional, I’m
sure.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Wait for me – I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – it’s me, Reggie Lampert –
listen Mr. Bartholomew: I’ve seen one of the Mr. Bartholomew? Can you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hello – Mr. Bartholomew – it’s me, Regina
Lam…</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Howdy, Miz Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Wha – what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You know what I want, Miz Lampert…</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – no, I’m don’t.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Come on now – sure you do. An’ you’d better
give it to me, Miz Lampert – cuz I ain’t foolin’. No sireebob!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know what –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Don’t make too much noise, Miz Lampert –</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: It could get a whole lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: It belongs to me, Miz Lampert – an’ if you
don’t give it to me your life ain’t gonna be worth the paper it’s
printed on. You savvy what I’m sayin’, Miz Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Please stop – please!</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert
– y’hear?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’re insane, absolutely insane!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Having a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You haven’t said a word since we left the
club – what happened back there?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I – I’m not sure if I’m supposed to tell you
or not.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think I follow you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He said if I told anybody it could prove
fatal for them as well as me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who said?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That’s what I’m not supposed to say.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Stop this nonsense! If you’re in some sort of
trouble I want to know about it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Stop bullying me. Everybody’s bullying
me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wasn’t –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, you were – you called it nonsense.
Being murdered in cold blood isn’t nonsense. Wait until it happens to
you sometime.</p>
<p><strong>night clerk</strong>: Bonsoir.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s’il vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>night clerk</strong>: Bonne nuit.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Would you mind seeing me to the door?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: This is quite a place for making friends,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You said this afternoon that your husband was
mixed up in something.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How do you shave in there?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What your husband was mixed up in.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Look, I know it’s asking you to stretch your
imagination, but can’t you pretend for a moment that I’m a woman and
that you’re a –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t you know I could already be arrested
for transporting a minor above the first floor?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: On the street where you live.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How about once more around the park?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Him: ‘Do you mind if I come in for a
nightcap, Reggie?’ Her: ‘Well – it is awfully late.’ Him: ‘Just one, all
right?’ Her: ‘Promise you’ll behave yourself.’ Him: ‘Sorry, baby, I
never make promises I can’t keep.’</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How would you like a spanking?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop
treating me like a child.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then stop acting like one. If you’re really
in some kind of trouble, I’d like to hear about it. Otherwise, it’s
late, I’m tired and I’m going home to bed.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you know what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Nothing. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Where is it, lady – where’ve you got it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know – I don’t know! I don’t –</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: I want it – give it to me – it’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Peter – ! Peter – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: A man – he tried to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Peter – ? Peter! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Peter – are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think I sprained my pride. Where’d he
go?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Out of the window, I guess – I didn’t see
him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lock the door and the window – and don’t let
anyone in except me. I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Be careful, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You took the words right out of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: What is it now, Pamela?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It happened again, Henry – another
strange man peered in the window at me and then went away.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Bad luck, Pamela.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: That was a dumb move, Herman – a dumb
move.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: And then some. If you’d only told us you was
goin’ to her room we could’ve kept ’em busy –</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: – but sneakin’ in there on your own that-a-way,
why, man, you was bound to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, what’d you
think he’d do – walk up ‘n’ shake you by that hand o’ yores?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: That’s right, Herman – you didn’t
leave me much choice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I didn’t hurt you, did I?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Never mind that – did you get the money?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck? You said you’d let me handle it alone – ! The
girl trusts me. If she’s got it, I’ll find out about it. But you’ve got
to leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: We took all the chances. The money belongs
to us, not him!</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Don’t be un-neighborly-like, Herman – don’t
forget he done us a little ol’ favor.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Yeah? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: He took care of Charlie for us.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: We appreciate it, really we do.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: But who asked him? Three shares are enough –
I’d say he’s out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. Make
up your minds – she’s waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: I don’t see how another twenty-four hours
could hurt.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Shoot no, not after all these years.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Then he gets it out of your share, not mine!
Not mine!</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: I suggest you get about your business –
nothing soothes Herman like success.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: That’s right – it’s like ticklin’ a alligator’s
belly.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who’s got the room next to hers?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Me. How come?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get another one, will you? I’m going to need
it.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: If you do find the money – you won’t forget t’
tell us about it, will you, fella?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Oh, I ain’t worryin’ – but see this pudgy
little fella here? He worries – an’ he’s even meaner’n I am.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: It’s me. Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie
– suppose you tell me what this is all about.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: There are three men – he’s one of them –
they think I have something that belongs to them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: A quarter of a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, it isn’t – where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know. Those men killed Charles to
get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So they think he left it with you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But he didn’t! I’ve looked everywhere – And
if I don’t find it – Those men going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, they won’t – I won’t let them.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Please help me, Peter – you’re the only one
I can trust.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course I’ll help – I told you I would,
didn’t I? Come on now –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m so hungry I could faint. I’ve – I’ve
gotten your suit all wet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s all right – it’s a drip-dry.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Peter, you’ve got to promise me something.
Promise you’ll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell
lies?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Usually it’s because they want something –
and they’re afraid the truth won’t get it for them.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you tell lies?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Mrs. Lampert? – it’s me – the man who was in
your room a few minutes ago –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The man you had the fight with.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Is Dyle with you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: The man who hit me, lady – Dyle – that’s his
name. What’s wrong – is he still there?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes – that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is it, Reggie – what’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Don’t trust him – don’t tell him anything.
He’s after the money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He – he said if I didn’t give the money,
he’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wouldn’t take that too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I believe what he said.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They’re only trying to scare you, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How do you know what they’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t – but as long as they think you have
the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is,
or don’t even know you have it –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mustn’t let what he said bother you. It
was only words.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Words can hurt very much.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go to sleep – I’ll see you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t put yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey – I’m on your side. Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, I’ll remember. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But if you’ll take my advice – You’ll undress
in the closet. Oh, and if you need me, just bang on the wall. I’ll be
next door.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: – But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew – what I
called to tell you was there’s someone else – someone who wasn’t in that
photograph you showed me. He says his name is Peter Joshua – but it
isn’t – it’s Dyle. Mr. Bartholomew? – are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I don’t know who this Mr. Dyle is, but
it’s just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You mean he might have – Mr. Bartholomew,
I’m catching the next plane out of here – I’m not going to sit here and
wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Where are you now – can you meet me? Do
you know Les Halles?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, where? – in fifteen minutes. I’ll be
there.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – !</p>
<p><strong>dyle’s voice</strong>: Reggie… !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Taxi – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: N’importe o� – vite! Allez-y!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Taxi – ! Taxi – !</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Follow that taxi.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Comment?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Taxi! Follow!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Je ne comprends rien.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Suivre – el taxi!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Ah! Oui, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Aux Halles – vite!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Incredible, isn’t it? Zola called it
‘le ventre de Paris’ – the womb of Paris, the belly.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What did you want to see me about,
Mr. Bartholomew?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Were you followed?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite
brilliantly. I’m beginning to think women make the best spies.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Agents.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew – I saw
it.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Dyle, or whatever his name is.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: What does your Mr. Dyle look like,
Mrs. Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He’s hardly my Mr. Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Describe him.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well – he’s tall – over six feet – rather
thin – in good physical shape, I’d say – dark eyes – quite handsome,
really.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, what?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: That’s not Carson Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Carson?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: There’s only one Dyle connected with
this affair, Mrs. Lampert – that’s Carson.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You mean you’ve known about him all along?
Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: It’s enough to make you a vegetarian,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s just lucky that I’m not hanging next to
one of those things right now.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – why didn’t you tell me you
knew about Dyle?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I didn’t see any point. Dyle’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Dead? Mr. Bartholomew – maybe you’d better
tell me what this thing’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I suppose you’re old enough to have
heard of World War Two?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Barely, yes.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. –
the military espionage unit – were ordered behind the German lines for
the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground.
The five men –</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Vous d�sirez?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: They always do that.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Caf�.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Gratin�e, choucroute garnie, salade de
pommes – et un ballon de rouge.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn’t planned
on spending the entire night here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Can I at least keep the onion soup?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: La soupe tout simplement.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Go on, please – five men – $250,000 – the
French Underground –</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Yes. The five men. They were, of
course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his
funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they
were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point
that they decided to steal the money.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Steal it how?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: By burying it, and then reporting that
the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the
war, dig it up and split it five ways – a quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: May I have a cigarette, please?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I hate these things – it’s like drinking
coffee through a veil.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Everything went smoothly enough until
after the gold was buried – then, before they could get out, they were
ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his
right hand – and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: What’s wrong with that one?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened
then?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Have you any idea what these things
cost over here?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew – what
happened then?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Scobie was able to travel, but Carson
Dyle was clearly dying, so they –</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: La soupe, c’est pour qui?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Carson was dying so they were forced to
leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and
waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn’t wait quite as long as
the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself
and disappeared. It’s taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to
catch up with him again.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But if they stole all that money – why can’t
you arrest them?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: We know what happened from the bits and
pieces we were able to paste together – but we still have no proof.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But what has all this got to do with the
C.I.O.?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We’re an
extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it
back.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing
you’ve told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris –
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I wouldn’t advise that, Mrs. Lampert.
You’d better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to
leave. Those men won’t be very far away – no matter where you go. In
fact, I don’t even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help
us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, if I’m going to die, I might as well
do it for my country.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: That’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: We’re anxious to know who this man is –
the one calling himself Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be
alive.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: No, Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But no one actually saw him die.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is
registered with the War Department in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh. Then who’s this one?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I don’t know – but I think you’d better
find out, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Me? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: You’re in an ideal position – he trusts
you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Agents.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Fraulein –</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Fraulein –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What are you doing, following me? Stop it –
we’re going to look like a parade.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How are you? When did you arrive in town?
Are you enjoying Paris? It’s lovely, isn’t it? So many wonderful things
to see and do, it makes one’s head spin to think of it.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Fraulein –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: If you don’t stop following me I’ll call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Taxi – !</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Dyle, please… D - Y - L - E.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Dyle – nothing today.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Thanks – see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Dyle, please – you’re wanted on the
telephone – Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4, please.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s the only name I’ve got. How about
you?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: No cat and mouse – you’ve got me. What do you
want to know?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why you lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I had to – for all I knew you could have been
in on the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, you know now, so please tell me who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: But you know my name – it’s Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Carson Dyle is dead.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Yes, he is. He was my brother.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Your –</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The army thinks he was killed in action by the
Germans, but I think they did it – Tex, Gideon and Scobie – and your
husband – because he wouldn’t go along with their scheme to steal the
gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I’m
trying to prove it. They think I’m working with them. But I’m not, and
that’s the truth. I’m on your side, Reggie – please believe that.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How can I? You lied to me – the way Charles
did – and after promising you wouldn’t. Oh, I want to believe you,
Peter… oh, but I can’t call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a
while to get used to your new name – which I don’t even know yet. What
is it? Aren’t you going to tell me? Hello – ?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: If you do anything funny, or try to talk to
anyone, I’ll kill you, Dyle – here and now. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: You’ll wreck your raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Next car, please.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Okay – turn around.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: We wait – with our mouths shut.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: How long do you intend – ?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: I said with the mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Okay – up there.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Do I knock or something?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The view had better be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Very pretty. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: I’ll give you a chance, Dyle – which is more
than you’d give me. Where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Is that why you dragged me all the way up here
– to ask me that? She has it – you know that.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: And I say maybe you both have it! One more
time, Dyle – where is it?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Supposing I did have it – which I don’t – do
you really think I’d hand it over?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: You’re out, Dyle – right now!</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Step back.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Back where?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: That’s the idea.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Herman?</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>scobie’s voice</strong>: How do you think?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: If you get bored, try writing ‘Love thy
neighbor’ a hundred times on the side of the building.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The next time madame forgets her key, there
is another one at the desk.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s impolite to
– What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I met a man with sharp nails.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Scobie?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I left him hanging around the American
Express.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Come on – I’ve got something that stings
like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Take off your shirt and lie down.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Listen – all I really want is an estimate.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s not so bad. You may not be able to lie
on your back for a few days – but, then, you can lie from any position,
can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Haven’t you got a bullet I can bite?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Are you really Carson Dyle’s brother?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Would you like to see my passport?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Your passport! What kind of a proof is
that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Would you like to see where I was
tattooed?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Okay, I’ll drive you around there some day.
Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your
first name is these days.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is there a Mrs. Dyle?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Yes, but we’re divorced.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I thought that was Peter Joshua.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’m no easier to live with than he was.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: There – you’re a new man.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you the truth, but I
had to find out your part in all this.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Alex – how can you tell if someone is lying
or not?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: There must be some way.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: There’s an old riddle about two tribes of
Indians – the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always
lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he’s a truthful
Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he’s a truthful Whitefoot,
but which one is he?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why couldn’t you just look at his feet?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Because he’s wearing moccasins.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh. Well, then he’s a truthful Whitefoot, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Why not a lying Blackfoot?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Which one are you?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Whitefoot, of course.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I hope it turns out you’re a Whitefoot, Alex
– I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh-oh – here it comes. The fatherly talk.
You forget I’m already a widow.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: So was Juliet – at fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m not fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Well, there’s your trouble right there –
you’re too old for me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why can’t you be serious?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: There, you said it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Said what?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Serious. When a man gets to be my age that’s
the last word he ever wants to hear. I don’t want to be serious – and I
especially don’t want you to be.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Okay – I’ll tell you what – we’ll just sit
around all day long being frivolous – how about that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Now please, Reggie – cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Cutting it out.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Who told you to do that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: But I’m not through complaining yet.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Now please, Reggie – cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I think I love you, Alex –</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The phone’s ringing –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Whoever it is won’t give up – and neither
will I.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Sorry – I was just – uh – nibbling on
something.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Miz Lampert, my buddies ’n me, we’d oblige it
mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall ’n chew the fat with
us for a spell.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Can you give me one good reason why I
should?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Yes, ma’am. A little one – ‘bout seven or eight
years old. Th’ little tyke keeps callin’ you his Aunt Reggie – ain’t
that cute?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: They’ve got Jean-Louis!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: That sounds like their problem.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: We’ll be waitin’ in room forty-seven, Miz
Lampert – so you just wiggle on over.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What day is it?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Lord, I forgot all about it – Sylvie works
late Tuesday nights – she always leaves him with me. They wouldn’t do
anything to a little boy, would they?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I don’t know – it depends on whether or not
they’ve already eaten.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Hey, Tex – move the kid to the other knee or
something, will you? My leg’s going to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Upsy-daisy.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Are you a real cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Sure am.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Then where is your gun?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Right here – see?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Will you put that thing away!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Jean-Louis!</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Howdy, Miz Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Who invited you?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I
see.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’d better call Sylvie – she must be
frantic.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: I’m afraid that will have to wait,
Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But his mother –</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: She isn’t going to be anybody’s mother
unless you answer some questions.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: This ain’t no game, Miz Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: We want that money – now!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Be quiet, all of you!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: And stop threatening that boy. He doesn’t have
the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Then who does?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I don’t know, Herman – maybe you do.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Or you – Or you –</p>
<p><strong>gideon, tex &amp; scobie</strong>: That’s the most ridiculous
– ! You gone loco? Listen to the man!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Slowly. Suppose one of you found Charles here
in Paris, followed him, cornered him on the train, threw him out the
window and took the money.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: That’s a crock! If one of us did that he
wouldn’t hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: But he’d have to. If he left he’d be admitting
his guilt – and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has
to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of
us to give up and go home. That’s when he’ll be safe and not a minute
before.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Up till now we always figured she had the
money – but you know so much about it, maybe you’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Then what am I doing here? You didn’t know
anything about me – I’m the only one who could have taken it and kept
right on going.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: He’s just tryin’ to throw us off! They’ve
got it, I tell you! Why don’t we search their rooms?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: It’s all right with us –</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: What are we wastin’ time for? Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: And while we’re waiting, we might as well go
through yours.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: Not my room!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What’s wrong, Herman – have you got something
to hide? Then I take it there are no objections.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: We’d better exchange keys. Here’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>scobie</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Mine’s in the door. Ariva durchy, y’all.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Come on – let’s get busy. Who gets your
vote?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Scobie – he’s the one that objected.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: He’s all yours. I’ll do Tex and Gideon. Take
Jean-Louis with you – and make sure you bolt the door from inside.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Viens, Jean-Louis – we’re going to have a
treasure hunt.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I
win a prize?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What should we give him?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: How about $25,000? Or do you think it would
spoil him?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Tex?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tex’s voice</strong>: Charlie’s stuff?</p>
<p><strong>gideon’s voice</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Mebbe we’d better call Herman.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: What for? If it’s not here, why bother
him?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: And if it is?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Why bother him?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You sure nuthin’s missin’?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: No. The police have kindly provided us with
a list.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: There sure ain’t nothin’ here worth no quarter
of a million.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Not unless we’re blind.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You think that mebbe we’re fishin’ the wrong
stream?</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You don’t s’pose one o’ us has it, like the man
said – I mean, that’d be pretty distasteful – us bein’ vet’rans o’ the
same war ‘n’ all.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: You know I’d tell you if I had it.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Nachurly. Jus’ like I’d tell you.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.</p>
<p><strong>tex &amp; gideon</strong>: Nachurly!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: – He’s all right, Sylvie, honestly. Just
hurry up and get here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Come on, now – if you wanted to hide
something, where would you put it?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: I know. I would bury it in the
garden.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Swell – only this man doesn’t have a
garden.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Oh. Neither do I. Voil�!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Voil� what?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Up there! I would put it up there!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You know something, cookie? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I hope I don’t find any little hairy things
living up here – wait! There is something! If I can just – yes, I’m
getting it – a case of some sort – it’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: I found it! I found it!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: If you think you’re getting credit for this,
you’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: We won! We won!</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: We found it! We found it!</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: We found it!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – ? Did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: What do you mean, no?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: The kid said –</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Up there! It is up there!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, Jean-Louis.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s nothing, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>tex’s voice</strong>: Jumpin’ frejoles – it’s Herman’s
spare.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Hey, that’s right!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: He’s in my room.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: What is the matter?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – you and the boy better wait here.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Now who’da done a mean thing like that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: This ain’t my room.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Mine, either.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The police aren’t going to like this one
bit.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: We could dry him off and take him down the
hall to his own room. He really doesn’t look so bad.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: We could put him to bed ‘n let one o’ them
fem-de-chambers find him in the mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Poor ol’ Herman – him ‘n good luck always was
strangers. Maybe now he’ll meet up with his other hand someplace – but I
sure hope it ain’t waitin’ for him in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: No! No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: A man drowned in his bed – impossible!
And in his pajamas – the second one in his pajamas – c’est trop b�te!
Stop lying to me – this nose tells me when you are lying – it is never
mistaken, not in twenty- three years – this nose will make me
commissaire of police. Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua – which is it?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And yet you registered in Megeve as
Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against the law to register under an
assumed name?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s done in America all the time.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: None of you will be permitted to leave
Paris – until this matter is cleared up. Only I warn you – I will be
watching. We use the guillotine in this country – I have always
suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight
tickling sensation on the back of the neck. It is only a guess, of
course – I hope none of you ever finds out for certain.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Who do you think did it – Gideon?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Or Tex?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’re a big help. Can I have one of
those?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Vanille-chocolat.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I think Tex did it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Because I really suspect Gideon – and it is
always the person you don’t suspect.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Do women think it’s feminine to be so
illogical – or can’t they help it?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What’s so illogical about that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: It’s always the person you don’t that means
you think it’s Tex because you really suspect if you think it’s Tex, it
has to be someone else – Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh. I guess they just can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Women. You know, I can’t help feeling rather
sorry for Scobie. Wouldn’t it be nice if we were like that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What – like Scobie?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced
down there next to the river in ‘American in Paris’ – without a care in
the world? This is good, want some?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’d love some, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: No sense messing up the streets.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Alex –</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m not going to hit you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, about Scobie, I mean. I can’t think of
any reason why he was killed.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too
many –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What makes you think that this somebody will
be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex – that means we’re in his
way, too.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie
– we’ve got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated!
Would you do anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What? Assassinate somebody?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: – swing down from there on a rope to save
the woman you love – like Charles Laughton in ‘The Hunchback of Notre
Dame’?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hurry up and change – I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Let me know what you want – I’ll pick a suit
that matches.</p>
<p><strong>dyle’s voice</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s the house detective – why haven’t you
got a girl in there?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Lord, you’re a pest.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’d like to take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better if you did it in my
room?</p>
<p><strong>dyle’s voice</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I wouldn’t want to use that tub. Besides, I
don’t want to be alone. I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I’m only next door – if anything happens,
holler.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Got you.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Did you ever hear the story of the boy who
cried wolf?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The shower’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – open the door.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: This is a ludicrous situation. There must be
dozens of men dying to use my shower.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Then I suggest you call one of them.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I dare you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower
with his shoes on? What a nut.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I usually sing a medley of old favorites when
I bathe – any requests?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Shut the door!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I don’t think I know that one.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What on earth are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Drip-dry!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How often do you go through this little
ritual?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: “Wearing this suit during washing will help
protect its shape.”</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Waterproof.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes – ?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Mrs. Lampert? – Bartholomew. I’ve
spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew – I’m
listening.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: I told them what you said – about this
man being Carson Dyle’s brother. I asked them what they knew about it
and they told me – you’re not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert – they told
me Carson Dyle has no brother.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Are you sure there’s no mistake?</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert –
be careful.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I left all my drip-dry dripping – is it all
right?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: You’re probably weak from hunger. You’ve only
had five meals today. Hurry up and we’ll go out.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you mind if we go someplace crowded? I –
I feel like lots of people tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Reggie – you haven’t spoken a word in twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie –
and the one who’s going to be next – me?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Nothing’s going to happen to you while I’m
around – I want you to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How can I believe it when you don’t even
know who the killer is? I’ve got that right, haven’t I? You don’t know
who did it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: No – not yet.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But then if we sit back and wait, the field
should start narrowing down, shouldn’t it? Whoever’s left alive at the
end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn’t you say
so?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Are you trying to say that I might have killed
Charles and Scobie?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: What do I have to do to satisfy you – become
the next victim?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s a start, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I don’t understand you at all – one minute
you’re chasing me around the shower room and the next you’re accusing me
of murder.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Carson Dyle didn’t have a brother.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: I can explain if you’ll just listen. Will you
listen?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I can’t very well leave without a pair of
water wings.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Okay. Then get set for the story of my life –
not that it would ever make the best-seller list.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Fiction or non-fiction?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Why don’t you shut up!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Are you going to listen?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: After I graduated college I was all set to go
into my father business. Umbrella frames – that’s what he made. It was a
sensible business, I suppose, but I didn’t have the sense to be
interested in anything sensible.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I suppose all this is leading somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: It led me away from umbrella frames, for one
thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: When a man has no profession except the one he
loathes, what’s left? I began looking for people with more money than
they’d ever need – including some they’d barely miss.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You mean, you’re a thief?</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Well, it isn’t exactly the term I’d have
chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Well, I can’t really blame you – not now.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But I do believe it – that’s what I don’t
believe. So it’s goodbye Alexander Dyle – Welcome home Peter Joshua.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: Sorry, the name’s Adam Canfield.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize
you’ve had three names in the past two days? I don’t even know who I’m
talking to any more.</p>
<p><strong>dyle</strong>: The man’s the same, even if the name
isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – he’s not the same. Alexander Dyle was
interested in clearing up his brother’s death. Adam Canfield is a crook.
And with all the advantages you’ve got – brains, charm, education, a
handsome face –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, come on!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: – there has to be a darn good reason for
living the way you do. I want to know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s simple. I like what I do – I enjoy doing
it. There aren’t many men who love their work as much as I do. Look
around some time.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is there a Mrs. Canfield?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>adam and reggie</strong>: – we’re divorced.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Right. Now go eat your dinner.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I could eat a horse.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think that’s what you ordered.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Don’t you dare to be civil with me! All this
time you were leading me on –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How was I leading you on?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: All that marvelous rejection – you knew I
couldn’t resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the
money.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What would you like me to say – that a pretty
girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a
quarter of a million dollars?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s a toss-up, I can tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t you know I’m having a tough time keeping
my eyes off of you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, you should see your face.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m not hungry – isn’t it glorious?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s all right – look.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You don’t look so bad in this light.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why do you think I brought you here?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I thought maybe you wanted me to see the
kind of work the competition was turning out.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything
they do.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back
in your day?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do you think I got here?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Aren’t you allowed to kiss back?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. The doctor said it would be bad for my –
thermostat.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: When you come on, you really come on.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well – come on.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I know why you’re not taken – no one can
catch up with you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Relax – you’re gaining.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Huh? You must be crazy – it’s three- thirty
in the morning – you mean now? – all right – I’ll be down in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Hey! Turn on the lights!</p>
<p><strong>gideon</strong>: Hey! How do you stop this thing?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Three of them – all in their pajamas!
C’est ridicule! What is it, some new American fad?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And now your friend – the one from
Texas – he has disappeared – checked out – pouf! into thin air! Where is
he?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Madame?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Tell me, Mr. Dyle – where were you at
three-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In my room, asleep.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And you, Mrs. Lampert?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I was, too.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: In Mr. Dyle’s room?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – in my room.</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: It stands to reason you are telling the
truth – for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: And if I were you, I would not stay in
my pajamas. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That wraps it up – Tex has the money. Go back
to bed – I’ll let you know when I’ve found him.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’re going to look for him – now?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If the police find him first they’re not very
likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Adam –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There’s no time – I’ll call you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Now Dyle, you listen to me – my mama didn’t
raise no stupid children. I know who’s got the money ‘n I ain’t
disappearing till I got my share – ’n’ my share’s growin’ a whole lot
bigger ev’ry day.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where are you, ol’ buddy?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: I’ll tell you what, fella – you want t’ find
me, you jus’ turn ’round – from now on I’ll be right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Open up.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think we were wrong about Tex having the
money.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I just heard from him – he’s still hungry.
That means killing Gideon didn’t get it for him – so he’s narrowed it
down to us. You’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’ve looked, Adam – you know I have –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where’s that airlines bag?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Lord, you’re stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I sure am. Get it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Charles must have had the money with him on
the train, and Tex missed it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But everyone and his Aunt Lilian’s been
through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s look anyway.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Lord, you’re stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I mean, it’s there, Reggie. If only we could
see it. We’re looking at it right now.</p>
<p><strong>adam’s voice</strong>: Something on that bed is worth a
quarter of a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: Yes, but what?</p>
<p><strong>adam’s voice</strong>: I don’t know – I just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Electric razor – comb – steamship ticket –
fountain pen – four passports – toothbrush – wallet – key – what about
that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: To the apartment – it matches mine
perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The letter –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’ll bet you don’t really need those.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You need them.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It still doesn’t make sense, but it isn’t
worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The tooth powder. Wait a minute – could you
recognize heroin just by tasting it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Heroin – peppermint-flavored heroin.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, I guess that’s it – dead end.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Go to bed. You’ve got to be at work in the
morning. There’s nothing more we can do tonight.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I love you, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, you told me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No – last time I said “I love you,
Alex.”</p>
<p><strong>italian delegate</strong>: – di conseguenza, il Governo
Italiano � decisamente a favore per l’incoraggiamento, in accordo con le
tradizioni etniche rispettive delle culture basilari dei passi in via di
sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro
risaie ed ai loro campi di soja tradizionali una raccolta di semola, non
solo sconvolgerebbe le loro secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, e
questo � molto importante per il Governo che io ho l’onore di
rappresentare disturberebbe l’esportazione delle derrate farinose
italiane in questa parte del mondo. Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della
vostra attenzione.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I hope Jean-Louis understands about last
night – it’s just not safe for him to be around me right now.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Don’t be silly – he would not do anything.
He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting
stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hold it – Italy just finished. They’re
recognizing Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Oh la vache!</p>
<p><strong>british delegate</strong>: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates –
my distinguished colleague from Italy. Her Majesty’s delegation has
listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this
problem, and while we find it charmingly stated, we cannot possibly
agree with its content. In 1937, in the British colonies of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanganyika – and, if I’m not mistaken, more or less in
Somaliland – a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis-�-vis
arable land which had never before known the plough, beginning before
the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of
Western Europe. In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty’s Government – at that
time His Majesty’s Government – was able to properly assay the
situation. We therefore oppose the resolution.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – I think I’ve found – are you on?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, it’s all right. What’s wrong, Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nothing’s wrong. I think I found something. I
was snooping around Tex’s room and I found this in the waste basket.
I’ve stuck it back together.</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: It’s the receipt Inspector
Grandpierre gave me – for Charles’s things. I don’t see how that’s going
to –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You didn’t look. Last night, when we went
through the airlines bag, something was missing. See – ? “One agenda.”
It wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’re right. I remember Grandpierre looking
through it. But there was nothing in it – at least, nothing that the
police thought was very important.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Can you remember anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Grandpierre asked me about an appointment
Charles had – on the day he was killed.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: With whom? Where?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I think it only said where – but I can’t
–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Think, Reggie, you’ve got to think – it may be
what we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That money’s not ours, Adam – if we keep it,
we’ll be breaking the law.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nonsense. We didn’t steal it. There’s no law
against stealing stolen money.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Of course there is!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There is? Well, I can’t say I think very much
of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie – please think – what was
written in Charles’ notebook?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well – it was a place – a street corner, I
think. But I don’t – Hold it. I’m on.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates – my
distinguished colleague from Great Britain –</p>
<p><strong>french delegate</strong>: Monsieur le Pr�sident, Messieurs
les d�l�gu�s – mon distingu� coll�gue de la Grande Bretagne – le
probl�me vu par mon Gouvernement n’est pas aussi simple que nos amis les
Anglais voudraient nous le faire croire. Mais leur pays n’est pas, apr�s
tout, un pays agricole, n’est-ce pas? La position fran�aise, ainsi que
nous l’avons soulign�e dans le rapport num�ro trente-neuf bar oblique
cinquante-deux de la Conf�rence de l’h�misph�re occidental qui a eu lieu
le 22 mars –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: as outlined in report number three-
nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March
22 – no wait! It was last Thursday, five o’clock at the Jardin des
Champs- �lys�es! Adam – that was it! The garden!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Thursday today – and it’s almost five –
come on!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Five o’clock – Thursday – the Garden – it’s
got to be something around here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But Charles’ appointment was last week, not
–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know, but this is all we’ve got left.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, you’re right there. Ten minutes ago I
had a job.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Stop grousing. If we find the money I’ll buy
you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You
take this side and I’ll poke around over there.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: It’s hopeless – I don’t even know what we’re
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s all right – I don’t think Tex does,
either.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Tex? You mean he’s here, too?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’d better see what he’s up to. Stay here – I
won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Be careful, Adam – please. He’s already
killed three men.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Sorry, fella –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The letter.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Taxi! – Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: All right – where’s the letter?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: The letter? The letter ain’t worth nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know what I mean – the envelope with the
stamps. I want it.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You greenhorn – you half-witted, thick-skulled,
hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: First her husband, now her – she hoodwinked
you! She batted all them big eyes and you went ’n fell for it - like a
egg from a tall chicken! Here! You want? Here – it’s yours!</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Look at you! Horn-swoggled by a purty face ‘n
all them sweet words! You killed all three of ’em for nothin’! You
greenhorn! You block-headed jackass! You clod – you booby – you
nincompoop – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Sylvie – ? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Hello, Reggie – I am waiting for
Jean-Louis.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What’s he up to?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: He was so excited – when he got the stamps
you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m glad. But what’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: The stamp market, of course – it is here
every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie –
we’ve got to find him!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: What’s the matter, ch�rie?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Those stamps – they’re worth a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: A fortune! Hurry – we’ve got to find
him!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: We will separate – you look over there.</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Jean-Louis – ?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Jean-Louis!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Jean-Louis!</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Jean-Louis – les timbr�s – o� sont- ils?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Oh, zut! Reggie – Reggie – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Jean-Louis – thank heavens! Do you have – !
What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: A man traded with me – all those for
only four.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis – where?</p>
<p><strong>sylvie</strong>: Vite, mon ange – vite!</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: L� bas – Monsieur F�lix.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Il est l�!</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: But he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t blame him. Jean-Louis – do you know
where this Monsieur F�lix lives?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: No – but I will ask.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Monsieur Th�ophile –</p>
<p><strong>th�ophile</strong>: Oui, jeune homme?</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Monsieur F�lix, o� habite-il?</p>
<p><strong>th�ophile</strong>: A Montmartre – demande � Monsieur August
au Bar des Artistes – Place Blanche.</p>
<p><strong>jean-louis</strong>: Merci, Monsieur Th�ophile. He says to
ask Monsieur August at the –</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: Entrez.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Monsieur F�lix – ?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: I was expecting you. You are American too, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: The man who bought them last week was
American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: Look at them, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: Have you ever, in your entire life, seen
anything so beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m – I’m sorry – I don’t know anything
about stamps.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: I know them as one knows his own face, even
though I have never seen them. This yellow one – a Swedish four shilling
– called ‘De Gula Fyraskillingen’ – issued in 1854.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: How much is it worth?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: The money is unimportant.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m afraid it is important.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: In your money, perhaps $65,000.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you mind if I sit down? What about the
blue one?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: It is called ‘The Hawaiian Blue’ and there
are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival
collector who was obsessed to own it.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What’s its value today?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: In human life? In greed? In suffering?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: In money.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: Forty-five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Do you have anything to eat? And the orange
one – what about the orange one?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: A two-penny Mauritius – issued in 1856. Not
so rare as the others – $30,000 perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: And the last one?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: The best for the last – le chef- d’oeuvre de
la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the
world. It is called ‘The Gazette Guyanne.’ It was printed by hand on
colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. Today
it has a value of $100,000. Eh, bien – I am not a thief. I knew there
was some mistake. Take them.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in
return, Monsieur F�lix – are they for sale now?</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: Let me see. There are 350 European, 200
Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative
– which comes to nine francs fifty.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Here’s ten.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Please keep it.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And
don’t forget these.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m – I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>f�lix</strong>: No. For a few minutes they were mine – that
is enough.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Adam? Adam? It’s me, Reggie – !</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Dyle –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hello – Balzac 30-04, s’il vous plait –
Mr. Bartholomew! Thank God you’re there! Tex is dead, Mr. Bartholomew –
smothered – and Adam did it – he killed them all!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert – you’d
better give that to me slowly. Who’s Adam?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The one who said he was Dyle’s brother – of
course I’m sure – Tex wrote the word ‘Dyle’ before he died. He’s the
murderer I tell you – he’s the only one left! You’ve got to do
something!</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: Calm down, Mrs. Lampert – please. Does
he have the money?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, I do – it was the stamps on that letter
Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the
time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>bartholomew</strong>: The envelope – imagine that.
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me – you’re not safe as long as you’ve got these
stamps. Go to the Embassy right away – wait, I’d better meet you halfway
– it’s quicker. Now, let’s see – do you know the center garden at the
Palais Royal? – yes, by the colonnade – as soon as you can get there.
Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Yes, I’m leaving now – goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – the stamps – what’ve you done with
–?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where are you going? Wait!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – stop!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead,
I’ve seen him! He said Dyle did it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not Dyle – you know that!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But Tex didn’t – he still thought – !</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t be an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – ! I want those stamps!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Palais Royal – vite!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Porte d’Italie, moi.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mais c’est tr�s vite! On veut me teur!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Italie.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Billet, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t want to go anywhere – I’m only trying
–</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Billet, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>“direction</strong>: Pte D’ORL�ANS Pte DE
CLIGNANCOURT——-”</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Come on – please –</p>
<p><strong>train guard</strong>: Billet, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>train guard</strong>: Vous �tes dans le premier classe,
Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>train guard</strong>: This car is for first class only – you
have a second-class ticket.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But that’s what they gave me.</p>
<p><strong>gendarme</strong>: Monsieur – ?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Embassies – embassies –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Shh. American Embassy? Mr. Bartholomew’s
office, please – Mr. Bartholomew’s office –</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Could you speak out, please? I can’t quite
hear you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No, I can’t speak any louder – Hamilton
Bartholomew – B as in – uh – Bartholomew – that’s right, and the rest as
in Bartholomew!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m sorry, but Mr. Bartholomew has left
for the day.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But someone’s trying to kill me – you’ve got
to send word to him – in the center garden of the Palais Royal, by the
colonnade – tell him I’m trapped in a phone booth, below him in the
M�tro station. And my name’s Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: All right, Mrs. Lampert – I’ll see what I
can do. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello, Mr. Bartholomew? – there was a call
for you just now, Mr. Bartholomew – it sounded quite urgent – a
Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>real bartholomew</strong>: Lampert? I don’t know any
Mrs. Lampert – trapped in a M�tro station? Who does she think I am, the
C.I.A.? All right, you’d better call the French police.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – !</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – wait!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – why won’t you listen?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m through listening to you!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But I didn’t kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Then who did? You’re the only one left.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – please believe me!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Bartholomew – he’s chasing me!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – stop! That’s Carson Dyle!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Carson – ?</p>
<p>****: Both “BARTHOLOMEW” and ADAM are in among the stone columns at
opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other’s sight.
REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps .</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: We all know Carson Dyle is dead,
Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Carson Dyle, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: You’re not going to believe him,
Mrs. Lampert – it’s too fantastic. He’s trying to trick you again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Tex recognized him – that’s why he said Dyle.
If you give him those stamps, he’ll kill you too!</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: Mrs. Lampert – if I’m who he said,
what’s preventing me from killing you right now?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Because he’d have to come out to get the
stamps – he knows he’d never make it.</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: What’s the matter with you,
Mrs. Lampert? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you? He wants
the money for himself – that’s all he’s ever wanted.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He’s – with the C.I.A. – I’ve seen him at
the Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t be a fool! He’s Carson Dyle!</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: That’s right, Mrs. Lampert – I’m a
dead man – look at me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I don’t know who anybody is any more!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You lied to me so many times –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – trust me once more – please.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Can I really believe you this time,
Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There’s not a reason on earth why you
should.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: All right, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or I’ll
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It won’t get you the stamps, Dyle – You’ll
have to come out to get them, and I’m not likely to miss at this
range.</p>
<p><strong>“bartholomew”</strong>: Maybe not – but it takes a lot of
bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and
my stomach – they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten
months in a German camp – with nothing to stop the pain and no food –
they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for
me. They deserved to die!</p>
<p><strong>reggie’s voice</strong>: But I didn’t have anything to do
with –</p>
<p><strong>carson’s voice</strong>: You’ve got the money. It belongs to
me now! Please believe me, Mrs. Lampert – I’ll kill you – a little more
blood won’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: I’ll give you five to make up your mind,
Mrs. Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Wait, please! I need some time to think!</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: One –</p>
<p><strong>carson’s voice</strong>: – two –</p>
<p><strong>carson’s voice</strong>: – three –</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: – four –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Adam – please!</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game’s over.
Come out of there.</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: I don’t want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert – but
I will –</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert – ?</p>
<p><strong>carson’s voice</strong>: I won’t wait much longer,
Mrs. Lampert</p>
<p><strong>carson’s voice</strong>: I know you’re in there, Mrs. Lampert
–</p>
<p><strong>grandpierre</strong>: Mr. Dyle – you are under arrest for the
murders of Charles Lampert, Herman Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold
Gideon, and whoever that is down there.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – you’d better tell him. He wouldn’t
dare hit a girl.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You didn’t have to chase me so hard –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Here, give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: That one’s done – start on this one.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I’m sorry I thought you were the murderer,
Adam – how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And that’s all the gratitude I get for saving
your hide.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The truth, now – was it my hide – or the
stamps?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What a terrible thing to say. How could you
even think that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: All right, prove it to me – tell me to go to
the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: I said, tell me to go to the –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I heard you, I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Then say it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reggie – listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Never mind – I’ll go by myself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What makes you think they’re even interested?
It’s only a quarter of a million – it’ll cost more than that to fix up
their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Who’s a taxpayer? Crooks don’t pay taxes.
Excuse me, soldier –</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Marine, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding the
return of stolen Government money?</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: You might try the Treasury Department, ma’am
– Room 216, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Do you mind if I wait out here? The sight of
all that money being given away might make me break out.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mr. Cruikshank, please – my name is
Lampert.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: – a Mrs. Lampert to see you – yes sir. Go
right in.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible,
crooked –</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Crooked? I should think you’d be glad to
find out I wasn’t crooked.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You couldn’t even be honest about being
dishonest. Why didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: We’re not allowed to tell. May I have
the stamps, please?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Here – Wait a minute – how did Carson Dyle
get an office in here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: When did you see him – what time, I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Around one.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: The lunch hour. He probably worked it
out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just
moved in for the time you were here.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Then how do I know this is your office?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Mrs. Foster – send a memo to Bartholomew
at Security recommending that –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Bartholomew?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: – recommending that all Embassy offices
be locked during the lunch hour.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Starting with his own.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Okay, now – hand over those stamps.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: What’s your first name today?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Brian.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Brian Cruikshank – it would serve me right
if I got stuck with that one.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Who asked you to get stuck with any of
them?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: But you’re – divorced?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: My mother – she lives in Detroit. Come
on now – give me those stamps.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Only if you can prove to me that you’re
really Brian Cruikshank.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: How about if next week some time I put
it on a marriage license – that ought to –</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Quit stalling – I want to see some
identification – now!</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: I wouldn’t lie on a thing like that – I
could go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’d lie about anything.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Well, maybe we’d better forget about it,
then.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You can’t prove it, can you? You’re still
trying to – marriage license! Did you say – ?</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: I didn’t say anything. Will you give me
those stamps?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You did too say it – I heard you. Oh, I love
you Adam – I mean Alex – er, Peter – Brian. I hope we have lots of boys
– we can name them all after you.</p>
<p><strong>cruikshank</strong>: Before we start on that, do you mind
handing over the stamps?</p>
