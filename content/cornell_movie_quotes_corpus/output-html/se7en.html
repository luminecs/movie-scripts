<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No… no. There’s nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Not that it’s any of my business… but, are you
figuring on moving out here eventually?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I just never seen a man mortgaging an empty
house before.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Everything here still seems… seems so
strange to me. All this.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I don’t know. I’d say this place is about as
normal as places get.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That is exactly what I mean. Strange.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Is that your car, man?</p>
<p><strong>first thug</strong>: What the fuck do you care?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Does that car belong to you?</p>
<p><strong>first thug</strong>: Yeah, it’s my car, alright? Fuck
off.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re telling me that’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>second thug</strong>: Well, for some strange reason, I don’t
believe you.</p>
<p><strong>first thug</strong>: You can fucking suck my…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Neighbors heard them screaming at each
other. It was nothing new or unusual. But, then they heard the gun go
off. Boom, boom… both barrels.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did his wife confess? Did she actually
speak the words?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: When the patrolman got here she was trying
to put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.
Crime of passion.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up
on the wall here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: This is a done deal. All but the
paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did their son see it happen?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What kind of question is that? Huh? He’s
dead. His wife killed him. There it is. That’s all. Anything else has
nothing to do with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You and your fucking questions, Somerset.
I’m glad I’m getting rid of you today. You know that, you fuck?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Uh… Lieutenant Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m David Mills… your new partner.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m a little thrown. I just finished
orientation at central, and they dumped me off down here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I heard you brought in two small-timers
last night.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Yeah. Two real idiots.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Since we are just starting out, I thought
we could go to a bar. Sit and talk for awhile. That way we can…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Excuse me, but I’d rather start sniffing for
a case, if it’s all the same to you. Seeing how we only have a week for
this whole transition thing. I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I meant to ask you something… when we
spoke on the phone. I can’t help wondering… Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I… I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All this effort you’ve gone through, to be
transferred from Philadelphia to here. It’s the first question that pops
into my head.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m here for the same reasons as you, I
guess. Or… at least the same reasons you used to have for being here…
…before you decided to give up.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You think you know me? You just met me two
minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Maybe I don’t understand the question.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s very simple. You’ve come from the
“City of Brotherly Love” to the “City of Brotherly Hate,” detective.
I’ve never seen it done that way.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe I thought I could do more
good here than there. You know, it’d be great by me if we didn’t start
right out kicking each other in the balls. But, you’re calling the
shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Let me tell you how I want this to go. I
want you to look, and I want you to listen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I wasn’t standing around Philly guarding the
fucking Liberty Bell.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: But, you’ve never worked homicide in this
city.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I realize that.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, please do me the favor of
remembering it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: At what time did you confirm the
death?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Like I said, we didn’t touch anything, but we
were on scene at like o-five- hundred, so he’s had his face in a plate
of spaghetti for about half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. You didn’t check him? You
didn’t check vital signs?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Believe me, he’s gone. Unless he’s breathing
spaghetti sauce now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No. The point is, when you’re first man in,
you check vital signs.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: This guy’s sitting in a pile of his own shit
and piss. If he ain’t dead he would have stood up by now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen, Godzilla…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you, Officer Davis. We’ll see you
again after we’ve had a look.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I wonder what exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis
there has found a supposedly dead man who didn’t really die until Davis
was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered
donut.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Drop it. We have more important concerns
just now, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fine… for now.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Bon appetit.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I guess that makes it homicide.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Still, he could have tied himself in. To make
it look like murder.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t see any blood or bruises yet. No
wounds. You see anything?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I saw a guy once… committed suicide, but he
wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, this guy took this big knife… and he held
it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into
the wall. Cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed
him in the back.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Except, he poked a big fucking hole in the
dry wall when he did it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If you could… spare me the anecdotes for
now. Leave the refrigerator open for the light.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, forgive me. I thought we had this
male-bonding thing going. My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What do you smell? Other than him, and all
the food.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know… there’s something.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: A bucket.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s vomit.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s a bucket of vomit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Is there any blood in it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Can’t tell by looking.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Mood lighting. Very sixties.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think he was poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And, those rats there somehow ate the poison
off the floor?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Guessing this early is useless.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: You girls have got the forensics guys out
there chompin’ at the bit. Don’t know if we’ll all fit in here
though.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s room. Light’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well, three is certainly a crowd in here.
And, with four, someone’s bound to be stepping on evidence. Detective
Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stay on this.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Send one forensic in on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We need to chat.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You just hold them up. I do all the work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’ve seen my files… seen the things I’ve
done?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes. Impressive work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, what’s your problem? I’ve done my time on
door-to-doors, and walking a beat.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I know it. That doesn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I did all that shit a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I made a decision, because I have to worry
about the integrity of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: When I’m on scene, I’m not going to worry
whether you think you’re getting enough time on the playing field. I’m
there to do the work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The badge in my pocket says “detective,” just
like yours. I’ve been Homicide for four and a half years.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’ve worked Homicide for four years, or
for five years… Don’t count the half-years, unless you want to sound
like a rookie.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oops. My hand slipped.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You fucked me over today, and you know it.
You know it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Just don’t jerk me off. That’s all I ask.
It’s not much. Don’t jerk me off. Please, do me the favor of remembering
that.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Mills. We don’t have
anything right now.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We’ll try to give you a call if we need
substitutes next month.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It was okay. I mean… it was certainly better
than yesterday. I think Somerset and I came to a small
understanding…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: …about this big.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: He sounds interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He is that, if nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We started a big homicide case today. I’ll
spare you the grisly details.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Name that tune? Anybody name that tune?
Name that tune…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’s… it’s like they emptied all the insane
asylums into the streets.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: That’s what it’s like. Like they just gave
up, and let everyone out.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: There are a lot of frightening people in this
city.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There are a lot of frightening people in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Name that tune? Anybody name that
tune?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It seems worse than Philadelphia, because
everything is pushed right up against you. In your face.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen, honey. I don’t want to fight tonight.
Okay? Can we just go one night without fighting about something?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m not trying to start a fight. How am I
trying to start a fight?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’re here now. Okay. Are we supposed to pack
it all in and go back? How are we going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Do I have to act like I love this place? Is
that what a “good wife” would do?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s a lot of pressure on me… I…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: And, there’s a lot of pressure on me. I’m
here with you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I know. I know…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m not going to close my eyes and block
everything out, David. I’m not going to act like you delivered us to
some sort of paradise. I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fuck you. Fuck you, you son of a bitch! I’m
walking here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m sorry… I couldn’t pass it up. I never had
a chance to actually do that. But, we can start the argument right back
up where we left off, right?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: That was the theme from tv’s Mod Squad.
I’m surprised nobody got that one.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: If you take a look here, buddies… I can
tell you, it was not a poison. If you can see… I have emptied all of
everything out of the stomach. But, look at it, now that I took away the
liver.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: I move the lungs over. First, see how big
this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is. Now… here is the strange thing, on
the stomach. Stretches. And, here is it distended. Look at the size of
that, because of the foods.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I can see what you’re pointing at…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: On the stomach. The lines of
distention.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Doctor, are you saying this man… ate till
he burst?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Yes, well, he didn’t actually burst. He
was bleeding, inside of himself. And, there’s a hemotoma on the outside…
on the belly.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He died by eating?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Someone punched him, or kicked him.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Oh, and there is this here… something else
you have to look at and see.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Most of his stomach contents are in the
lab now… but, this. I found these in the fat man’s stomach.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Plastic?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Why these were in a fat man’s stomach, I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Those bruises on the back of the victim’s
head were caused by the muzzle of a gun.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave
him a choice: eat, or get your head blown off.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He was force-fed… till his body started
rejecting the food. He literally couldn’t eat another bite.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, the killer held a bucket under him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: His throat was swollen from the effort. He
was bleeding internally. He must have blacked out… and, if you’re the
killer, you’re not going to want to wait around for him to die.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon.
Somerset, look here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Same color and texture.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If this is what that is… it doesn’t make
sense. It doesn’t figure.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Always look for one thing to focus on.
There’s always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck
of dust, but find it and focus… till it’s an exhausted possibility.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How are pieces of the floor going to get in
the guy’s stomach?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Exactly. Why would so many pieces be
inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: “Dear Detectives. Long is the way, and hard,
that out of hell leads up to the light.” This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Milton.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a quote from a book. Milton’s
Paradise Lost.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I said to myself, I’m not going to screw
around with this. Nope. Fuck that. It’s still pretty fresh meat. I
called the medical examiner… he’s coming. When I got to it, I knew. As
soon as I laid eyes on it, I knew…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: …this is your guy who did this.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: A pound of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “One pound of flesh, no more no less. No
cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go
free.”</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down nude,
holding a carving knife. And he was given a long time… to decide. Where
to make the first cut? There’s a gun to your head… but, what part or
parts of your body are expendable?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at
once, his love handle. But, he went into shock. Bled to death.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What is the point, Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Look at both killings together. This
murderer is an artist.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: An artist?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He uses colors and symbols. He positions
the bodies after death, so he’s working with composition. It’s been
premeditated so meticulously… and this is just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Wrong. For all we know, we might never hear
from him again, and I don’t want that kind of talk floating around.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The rats and the pennies. The circle and
the triangle on the wall. There’s something about them… these murders
mean something.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: So? What?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You with him, or you just here to
watch?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is his stuff, captain. I’ve been out in
the cold most of the day.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Always working overtime up in that big
brain of yours, huh? Always cooking.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I need you to know… I want us reassigned.
We’re declining this case.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This cannot be my last duty here. It’s
going to go on and on.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You’ve left unfinished business before.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Everything else was taken as close to a
conclusion as humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Can I just say something?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Also… I don’t think this should be Mills’
first case.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This is not my first case, fuckhead!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t have anyone else to give this to,
Somerset. And nobody’s going to swap with you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Give it to me, then. There’s nothing that
says I have to fly with him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If Somerset wants out, fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It would be too much for him, too
soon.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Could we talk about this in private?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s not necessary. You’re in.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Start picking up the pieces. I’ll shuffle
some paper and try to get you a new partner.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You win, Somerset. You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What are you going to do with yourself out
there, Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ll get a job. Maybe on a farm. I’ll fix
up my house.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Can’t you feel it yet? Can’t you feel that
feeling… that you won’t be special anymore?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Did you read in the paper today, about the
man who took his dog for a walk? And how he was mugged? And, his wallet
was taken, and his watch. Then, while he was still lying unconscious,
his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened last
night. Not far from here.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I have no understanding of this place.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s always been like this.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes. You’re absolutely right.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You were made for this work, Somerset. I
can’t believe you’re going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a
fishing rod. But, I guess I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Put a little elbow grease into it!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He must have left us another puzzle to solve…
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’ll keep looking, but we’re running out of
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Christ…</p>
<p><strong>vagrant</strong>: Spare me a cigarette, money-grip? Spare me
a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Sorry. Last one.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I have voiced the same concerns to our
law enforcement officials, and they assure me he is of the highest
caliber.</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: As District Attorney, don’t you feel
some responsibility? Detective David Mills lacks the experience…</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: I’ve always said… I’ve always said, don’t
send a boy to do a man’s job.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: But, David Mills has a sterling record with
the Philadelphia force. I stand behind him one hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You tell ’em boss. Detective David Mills is a
wonderful human being…</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: However… however… let me say this…</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: If Detective Mills, at any point in this
investigation… if he is not pulling his weight, I will be the first in
line to pull his plug.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I always figured that’s the only reason you
and I used to be friends. Because I was a friend of hers.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I painted that about five years ago. I
always told myself I’d give it to you next time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Things are different these days, pal. You
wouldn’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: People buy my paintings now… they drive
down in their BMWs and Rolls Royces. It’s the new money generation. I
guess they think they’re touching the avant-garde…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: There’s another thousand dollar William
McCracken expression of anarchy.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Make that two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How is she? Have you seen her
recently?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Huh… oh. No. She moved out of the city.
Last winter. She married some businessman, or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Good for her. I’m leaving soon myself. I’m
finally getting out.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yeah? What happened to the idealistic
super-cop I used to know?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He became a realist.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh… sorry.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Not that I don’t appreciate your recent
artistic endeavors… but, what happened to the painter I used to
know?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Man… can I buy these from you?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They’re not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What is it? What’s the murderer trying to
say?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What picture is he painting?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I… I’ve seen things like that…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s church stuff. Christianity.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: When it first started… Christian artwork
was all from Bible stories. It was like… nobody had any imagination. It
was all… standardized.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But, later, everyone started painting to
tell their own stories… to teach lessons. Guys like Bosch, Bregel the
elder… Van Eycks.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The seven deadly sins.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s what these murders remind me of.
Paintings like these. Gluttony… greed…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth. Seven
deadly sins.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Amen, brother.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I can find more examples. There’s lots of
paintings like those… painted over hundreds of years. And you’re right…
that murderer is an artist.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And, it’s two down… five to go.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: …are you, Sir? Is Jesus Christ your Lord
and Master? Do you believe in Him?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Don’t ignore me. Listen to what I have to
say. Christ can be your savior!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Think about God, sir. I can help you let
Him into your life.</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Interesting isn’t it, friend? You like that,
you like girls, then come on in.</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: You’ll see a lot more inside. You’ll see a
lot more than that.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Uh… I was looking for Mills. David, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: He’s not here right now.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset. If I
could leave these books for him.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: David went for a walk. To clear his head. Oh,
you can put those here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Could you tell him… tell him this is his
reading assignment. It’s urgent. I’ve marked the most important
pages.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Would you like some coffee, or a drink. David
should be back any minute.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I do have to get going.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: At least I got to meet you. David has told me
a lot about you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Really? Good things, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, yes. He said you were very smart.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I think he’s a bit intimidated by you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m going to leave him a list of
specifics. It all relates to the case he’s on.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You two aren’t working together anymore.
Isn’t that so?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tracy. David and I weren’t exactly what
you could call fast friends.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I doubt your husband shares that
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You know, Somerset, David is very…
determined. I’m sure you’ve seen, it’s not likely he’ll ever be compared
to Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’s a good cop. He just…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: He sees policework as a crusade. That’s what
he wants it to be, and, that might sound naive, but he’s made a
conscious choice to be naive. Believe me, his heart’s in the right
place.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I hear you and he were high school
sweethearts.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yeah. Pretty hokey, huh? But, what girl
wouldn’t want the captain of the football team as their lifelong
mate?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s rare these days… that kind of
commitment.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well… this will only take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: My future.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You have a strange way about you, Somerset… I
mean in a good way… unusual.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I apologize. I’ll get out of your hair.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’s just… it’s nice to hear a man who talks
like that. If David saw that paper, he’d say you’re acting like a
homosexual. That’s how he is.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well! I guess I won’t be showing this to
him then.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I suppose not.</p>

<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fucking Dante. Goddamn, poetry writing freak,
mother-fuck…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Good work, Officer. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How’s it coming?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s your name on the door.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Detective Mills here. Honey, I asked you not
to call unless… What… why? Okay… okay. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello? Yes, well… I appreciate the
thought, but… I… Well, I guess I’d be delighted to. Thank you…
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m invited to have a late supper with you
and your wife. And I accept.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Why aren’t you married, Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Tracy. What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I was close. It just didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It surprises me you’re not married. It really
does.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Any person who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me… disagreeable. Just ask your husband.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No argument.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: How long have you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Too long. Much too long. What do you think
of our fair city?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You take the bad with the good, I suppose.
It’s… it’s…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It takes time to settle in.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’ll get used to it pretty quickly.
There are things in any big city that stand out at first. But…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Subway train. It’s right below us/</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’ll go away in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This real estate guy… a real scum, brought us
to see this place a few times. And, it was nice enough, and the price
was right. I was thinking it was nothing, but I started to notice, he
kept hurrying us along. I mean what could it be? Why would he only show
it like five minutes at a time, before he’d hustle us out the door?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: We found out the first night.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m sorry… it’s a nice apartment.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All television does is teach children that
it’s really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who didn’t
have a television.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That’s weird. It’s un-American.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What about sports?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You go to movies at least.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I read. Remember reading? What’s the last
book you read, Mills?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: T.V. Guide.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Excuse me. I just have to say, I can’t
respect any man who’s never seen Green Acres.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’ve never seen The Odd Couple? The
Flintstones?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone named…
Dino.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We think he acted like he was delivering a
package. The doorman at Mr. Gold’s building says he doesn’t even look at
anyone who goes in anymore.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No connection between the two victims?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No witnesses of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: None. Which I can’t understand. It’s like
this guy’s invisible.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: In this city, minding your own business is
a perfected science.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: At the precinct, Sunday nights, they offer
a public crime prevention course. And, the very first thing they teach
is that you should never scream “help” if you’re in trouble. Scream
“fire.” Because people don’t want to get caught up in anything. But, a
fire… that’s entertainment. They come running.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “The Sun in Splendor with the Eye.” It
refers to God the father, and to Saint Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Which saint is he?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Aquinas wrote a summary of theology, Summa
Theologica. And he wrote about the seven deadly sins.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Now, what else have you got?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Look, I appreciate being able to talk this
out, but… it’s my case.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: So… satisfying my curiosity. I’m still
leaving town on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The eyes were circled. With Mr. Gold’s
blood.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is his wife?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: She was away on business. She got back the
day he was killed. If this means she saw anything, I don’t know what.
We’ve questioned her about ten times.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And, if it’s a threat?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We put her in a safe house.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is the one thing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s like he’s preaching. The sins were
used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then
seven deadly sins, as a learning tool. The sins distract man from true
worship. True faith.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Like in these paintings, and in Dante’s
Purgatory, right? But, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy climb that big
mountain…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Seven Terraces of Purgation.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Anyway… pride comes first, not gluttony. And
in all the paintings, the sins are in a different order. I can’t find a
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Because there’s creativity in the mix.
Consider these books as the murderer’s inspiration. Or aspiration.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He sees himself contributing to the body
of Christian work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s punishing these people.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: For all of us to see and learn from. These
murders are like forced attrition.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What? Forced what?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Attrition. When you regret your sins, but
not because you love God.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Because someone’s holding a gun on you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: When Mr. Gold’s wife found the body, about
how long was she in the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: She didn’t find it. The door to the apartment
was open and a neighbor…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I thought you said she found the body.
When she got back from a business trip.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No. She got back after you and I had already
been there.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Maybe she is supposed to see something…
she just hasn’t had a chance to see it yet.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Please, look for anything strange or out of
place. Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I… I don’t understand. Why now?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I need your help if we’re going to get the
guy who killed your husband. If there’s anything in these pictures…</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Are you absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I can’t do this now… please.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He sees himself contributing to the body
of Christian work.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s punishing these people.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: For all of us to see and learn from. These
murders are like forced attrition.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What? Forced what?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Attrition. When you regret your sins, but
not because you love God.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Because someone’s holding a gun on you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: When Mr. Gold’s wife found the body, about
how long was she in the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: She didn’t find it. The door to the apartment
was open and a neighbor…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I thought you said she found the body.
When she got back from a business trip.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No. She got back after you and I had already
been there.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Maybe she is supposed to see something…
she just hasn’t had a chance to see it yet.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Please, look for anything strange or out of
place. Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I… I don’t understand. Why now?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I need your help if we’re going to get the
guy who killed your husband. If there’s anything in these pictures…</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Are you absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: I can’t do this now… please.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We have to show her those. There might be
something she’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Have her look one last time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: Wait. Here… here’s something…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: This painting… in the living room…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs gold</strong>: Why is it hanging upside-down?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This has got to be it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It has to be. He changed the wire to
rehang it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Give it up. The killer didn’t paint the
fucking thing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He fucked us.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Bear with me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Shut up and wait!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Call the print lab. Now.</p>
<p><strong>forensic</strong>: Oh, boy…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen, honestly… have you ever seen anything
like this? Been involved in anything remotely like this?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. I have not.</p>
<p><strong>forensic</strong>: Well, I can tell you this, detectives…</p>
<p><strong>forensic</strong>: …just by studying the underloop… these are
not the victim’s prints.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It doesn’t work for me. I can’t believe he
wants us to help him stop.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Who the hell knows? There’s plenty of
schizoids out there doing dirty deeds they don’t want to do. With tiny
voices whispering nasty things in their ears.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I’ve seen this baby take three days to
finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere
else.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You really meant what you said to
Mrs. Gold. You really believe we’ll get him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: And you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I wish I still thought like you. I’m so
far gone from that.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So, tell me what you think we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All we do is pick up the pieces. We take
all the evidence… all the pictures, statements. Write everything down
and note what time things happened. We take it all, make a nice, neat
pile and file it away. Just in case it’s ever needed in a courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re unbelievable. In my entire life,
you’re the oldest man I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ve seen even the most promising clues
lead to dead ends. Hundreds of times.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ve seen the same. I’m not the country
hick-boy you seem to think I am.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: In this city, if all the skeletons came
out of all the closets… if every un- revenged corpse were to suddenly
rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Don’t try to tell me you didn’t get that rush
tonight… that adrenalin. Like we were getting somewhere. And, don’t try
to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play
well in a courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Wake up, Glimmer Twins. We have a
winner.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: His street name is Zero, as some of you
know. His prints were found at the scene by Detectives Mills and
Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Now, Zero has a long, long history of
mental illness. Serious illness. He was all over your television sets
two years ago after he raped and killed a seventy-three year old woman.
He got off, as the saying goes, on a technicality. So we watched him on
the streets, and he went out of circulation about a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: If he disappeared, what do you want from
us?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: His last place of residence is still in his
name. A search warrant is being pushed through the court as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: So, have the housing cops walk up and
ring the doorbell. Problem solved.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Listen, California. When you go in, if Zero
isn’t home, some of his buddies might be house-sitting. And besides
using, Zero deals, so, you will be very uninvited guests.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Does not seem like our killer, does
it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You tell me. I’m new in town.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Zero does possess the requisite degree of
insanity… but, he doesn’t have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to
have more purpose. More purpose than Zero could ever conceive of.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We’ll tag along.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Why would we?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Satisfy our curiosity?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You ever take one?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. Never in twenty-four years. I took my
gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it. I never
fired it. Not once.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I pulled it once, fired it once. I never took
a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It was my first one of these. We were a
secondary unit, in vice. I was pretty shaky going in. When we busted the
door, looking for a junkie, the fucking guy opened fire. One cop was hit
in the arm. He went flying… like in slow motion. I remember riding in
the ambulance. His arm was like… a piece of meat. I thought, it’s just
his arm. But, he bled to death right there anyway.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How did the fire-fight end?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well, I was doing really good in Philly up
till then. Lots of simple busts. I’ve always had this weird luck… but,
this was wild. I got that fuck with one shot… right between the eyes.
And the next week, the mayor’s pinning a medal on me. Picture in the
paper, the whole nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I expected it to be bad, because I heard
about other guys. You know… I took a human life. But, I slept like a
baby that night.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I think Hemingway wrote somewhere… I can’t
remember where, but he wrote that, in order to live in a city, you have
to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to
do it, not just faking it, to survive.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sounds like he knew what he was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: This is it. Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Police!! Open the door!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Good morning, Sweetheart!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get up now, motherfucker! Now!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I said get up, Sleepyhead!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Oh, fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Sloth… it’s sloth.</p>
<p><strong>black cop</strong>: What the hell… those are dead worms.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Check this out, dick.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s him. It’s Zero.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Someone call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Someone call a hearse, more like.</p>
<p><strong>blond cop</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hey, California. Get your people out.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You heard him. Hit the hall, and don’t
touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: It looks like he’s some kind of friggin’
wax sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset, you… you better look here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: All pictures of Zero tied to the bed. The
last one’s dated three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The first photo… it’s dated one year ago.
Almost to the day.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Mo-ther…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You got what you deserved, Zero.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: A urine sample… hair sample… fingernail
clippings. He’s laughing at us.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: He’s still alive!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The way this has gone, I didn’t think it
was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy. The type of
intestinal fortitude it must take… to keep a man bound for a full year.
To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I want him bad. I don’t just want to catch
him anymore. I want to hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Listen… we have to divorce ourselves from
our emotions here. We have to keep focusing on the small details.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I don’t know about you, Somerset, but I feed
off my emotions.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: He’ll string us along all the way if we’re
not careful.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Are you listening to me?!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say cheese.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I have a right, Officer. I…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That doesn’t mean anything. This is a closed
crime scene now!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t do this! You can’t…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get the fuck out of here!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The public has a right to know!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How do those cockroaches get here so
quick?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: They pay cops for the inside scoop, and
they pay well. You can hate them, but you better give them something, or
they’ll make it all up.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m sorry… I just…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh, it’s alright. It’s always impressive
to see a man feeding off his emotions.</p>
<p><strong>beardsley</strong>: A year of immobility seems about right,
judging by the deterioration of the muscles and spinal cord. Blood tests
show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system. Heroin… crack… even an
antibiotic which was administered to keep the bed sores from
infecting.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He hasn’t said anything, or tried to express
himself in any way?</p>
<p><strong>beardsley</strong>: Even if his brain were not mush, which it
is… he chewed his own tongue off a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s no way he’ll survive?</p>
<p><strong>beardsley</strong>: Detective, he’d die right now of shock if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Put them away. I wish you hadn’t brought
them into the church.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I needed for you to see them.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: There were five principal phases in the
development of early Christian art. From Hellenistic through the
Renaissance… each period was affected by the decrees of religious
leaders.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If this killer belongs to a certain branch
of the church… if he collects religious art from a certain period, I
want to know. I have to narrow it down.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: The influences on these… things he’s done,
couldn’t have come before the Gothic period. What’s in those pictures is
presented far too asymmetrically.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: The colors will tell the tale.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Each sin had a symbolic color. But the
specific color designations changed throughout the ages.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: This is an example. Gluttony is the sin,
and the color is orange. This particular manuscript is preserved from
the 18th century.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: In the murders, gluttony is green. Greed
is yellow. Sloth is indigo.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: So, if this murderer is as precise as you
say, then you need to find out at what period in history was gluttony
green… and so on.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where do I look? If the colors changed so
often?</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: There is one man… Father Stone. I haven’t
heard from him for quite some time. This was his passion. He spent his
life studying the sins… and preaching against them.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Zero’s landlord said an envelope of cash
was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, “I never heard a
single complaint from this guy and nobody ever complained about him.
He’s the best tenant I ever had.”</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s a landlord’s dream tenant. A
paralyzed man with no tongue.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Who pays his rent on time.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Bring me everything as soon as it’s
transcribed.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Milton.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Father Stone had a church and congregation
of his own. But, he… there were some problems. The church is deserted
now.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Problems?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: There was a small orphanage attached to the
church, overseen by Father Stone. This was almost thirty years ago. He
was an excellent priest, devoted in every way. Many in his parish
demanded his return.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Allegations were made… Stone was accused of
abusing the children in his care. But, those charges were never
substantiated.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What abuse?</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: It was claimed… that the children were
beaten. And, punished severely.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Father Stone. I’m a policeman. I’d like to
ask you a few questions, if it’s alright?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I want to ask you about the seven deadly
sins.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: The sins.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yes, father.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Are you one of mine?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Are you saved? Do you have God?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I… I need to ask about the sins. Do you
understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Are you a sinner?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: There are sinners here. Even here. And, pain
waits for them. Hell is hungry for them.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: They don’t realize… they don’t know. Fuck
them all!</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: They shouldn’t have let you disturb him. This
shouldn’t have been allowed.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Where are the children? Where are the
children?!</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m just looking.</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Saint Jerome Emiliani. The patron saint of
orphans.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Is this still the Lord’s house?</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: Of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: And, even if Father Stone was guilty of
everything… if he was hurting children here? It’s still the Lord’s
house?</p>
<p><strong>bleeker</strong>: You have no faith, Somerset? Have you given
up on the church entirely?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. That’s not what I’ve given up on.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Our guy’s a bookworm, right? And, I know it’s
a long shot, but you have to give a picture id and current phone bill to
get a library card. Hey…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I made two separate lists of books. One
relating to the sins… Dante’s Purgatory, Canterbury Tales… The
Dictionary of Catholicism… all the religious stuff. The second list was
books about torture methods, mass murderers… sadomasochism. Whatever our
killer might study to do the things he’s done. Whatever his other
interests are.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: So, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Alright. Everything at the library goes into
a computer. So, you can get in the system and cross-reference…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Let’s say you take, Dante’s Purgatory, call
number eight-five-one-D, and… The Biography of the Marquis de Sade,
ninety-two S-A-D-E. Put those books in the system, and the computer can
give you the name of anyone who’s ever taken out both those books. And,
it doesn’t just give you their name and address, it gives you a complete
history of their library reading habits.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If somebody’s out there reading Paradise Lost
and studying The Life and Times of Charlie Manson, I want to talk to
them.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Dario! Come here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: According to the Father, this orphanage
wasn’t around for more than five or six years in the late fifties. So, I
want someone to go to the Department of Child Welfare or City Hall and
dig up all the records on this place. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>dario</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Get a list of every child who attended
this orphanage before it shut down. Get it on my desk within the
hour.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You thought of this all by yourself? This
was your brainstorm?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Yeah. Is that so hard for you to believe?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m not as stupid as I look.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Ramirez. Manuel Ramirez.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No… I don’t see any Ramirez.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Elinski. Dennis Elinski.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Atwater? Paul Atwater.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay, here we go. Listen to the books this
guy’s been taking out… Basic Homicide Investigation. Forensic
Toxicology… The Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers… Of Human
Bondage.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s not what you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Holy shit. Somerset… The Writings of Saint
Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Aquinas. Right?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s right. Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fuck… he used a false name.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: His library card lists him as Jonathan Doe.
John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Christ… it’s like a sick joke.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There is one boy here. He was abandoned…
no one knew who his parents were, so he was named at the orphanage… John
Doe. It’s his legal name.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s impossible odds that this is him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’re focusing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I know, I know. On one little thing. I’m not
complaining. I’ll follow anything we get and I’ll take it any way we can
get it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’ll look at him. Ask a few questions.
Try to get a feeling whether we should keep tabs on him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ll do the talking, right? Let me practice
here… um, excuse me Mr. Doe, but, are you by any chance a serial killer?
Oh… oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It’s him! Jesus Christ, we can get this
fucker!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Are you alright? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Yeah. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>one forensic</strong>: I hear he’s running around with an uzi
in one hand and a book of poetry in the other.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Give us first crack at it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset, we had him. Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: The pass is a fake… we had him.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: We were that close to him.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sketch artist</strong>: This is the guy?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Make sure it gets around.</p>
<p><strong>sketch artist</strong>: You got it. Tomorrow morning, this
city’s good citizens will be on the lookout for Elmer Fudd.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We can’t find anything to hang onto. No
pay-stubs, no appointment books or calendars. Not even a book of phone
numbers. And, you’re not going to believe this…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s just… we haven’t found any fingerprints
yet. Not one.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You know, you’re right. I don’t believe it.
Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We need to put more men on this.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m working on it, alright. What have we
got.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’ve got about five thousand notebooks in
this room. And, as near as I can tell, each notebook contains two
hundred and fifty pages.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Then, he must write about the murders.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: “What sick, silly puppets we are, and what
a gross stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing around, not a care
in the world. Not knowing that we are nothing. We are not what God
intended.” “On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.
He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and
other things. I tried to be accommodating, but my head began to hurt
from his banality. I almost didn’t notice it had happened, but I threw
up all over him. And I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.” No dates
indicated. They’re placed on the shelves in no discernible order. He
describes a scab on his arm for five pages, then writes about
existential philosophy on the next.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s just his mind poured out on
paper.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You were right. He is preaching.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Hello… hello?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I admire you, David. Imagine my surprise
on finding you at my doorstep. I admire you more and more every day.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Okay, John. Let’s…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: No, no, no! You listen and don’t talk. I
suppose you found the painting and the photos. This is just as well. Now
we all know we’ve all seen each other. I mean what I say. I do admire
you.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Oh, there is one other thing. Fourteen
hundred thirty. West Eighty-sixth street. Apartment six-o-four.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Pride. Just like in the painting.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You can see what he did.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Cut her up… dressed the wounds. He put the
noose around her neck and stood her on the chair.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: She had the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Call for help, and you’ll live. But, you’ll
be mutilated.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself
a lifetime of hideousness.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: He cut off her nose to spite her face. And
he did it very recently.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Alright, boys, you’re running on empty. Go
home. Just make sure you sleep with the phone between your knees.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tracy?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Somerset. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m alright. I’m glad to see you found
this place. I almost should have expected to run into you here, knowing
that you teach English.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: It’s so huge. It’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is why I moved into this
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Don’t you love the smell of all the old
books. It smells like… like… I guess just old books, but, I love it.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Forgive me. No matter how often I see guns, I
can’t get used to them.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: If David’s going to be back home soon, I
should get back.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I hope you’ll come to dinner another night.
Before you leave.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You can stay and browse a little longer,
can’t you? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I… I hardly know anyone I can talk about
books with anymore. I’d appreciate the company.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: The irony is, that after a day of the type
of work he did, he’d come home and read me these morbid crime stories.
Le Fanu’s Green Tea. Murders in the Rue Morgue.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: My mother would give him hell… because I
was young, and he was keeping me up till all hours, giving me
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Sounds like a father who wanted his son to
follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: One birthday, he gave me a hardcover book
called The Century of the Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald. It traced the
history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate. Because it was
real, and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime…
was incredible to me.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We’re closing up, Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: David’s going to wonder where I am.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ll give you a ride.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No. Please, don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I have to insist. If your husband found
out I let you ride the subway at this hour he’d tear my head off.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I mean, literally.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You’ve lived here for so long, Somerset. You
know this city. I…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s a hard place, Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: When David and I lived in Philadelphia, we
could afford to live on the outskirts. But now… I hate it here. I feel
scared, and I feel sick and… I hate it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You have to put blinders on sometimes.
Most times. But, keep in mind, Tracy, like tonight, there are small
pockets of sanity. Some bars and bookstores. Museums. Several last
vestiges of civilization.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ve visited so many of the schools, looking
for work, you know. And, the conditions are… horrible. I can’t believe
how bad it is. Children shouldn’t have to grow up here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You can always look into the private
schools. You’ll find something.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’re too hard on yourself, Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It’s okay to hate this city. It’s natural.
But, there is a bright side in all this. There is. You want to hear
it?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, God, yes. Please.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can’t think of another place that needs
education more than this city. And you’re a teacher. You can make a
difference in a few people’s lives. It’s a very good thing.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Goodnight, Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m sorry, Tracy. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I… I better go.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It won’t be for long, honey. I swear. This is
just till this is over.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I know. It can’t be helped.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: There’s two people in that painting. So,
maybe he’s planning to kill two people this time. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What’s wrong this morning?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Nothing. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Lust is next. Lust is sex.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Apples on the floor. Original sin.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Adam and Eve.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sex, sex, sex. Fucking sex.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Lust is everywhere. That’s the hard part.
I think lust is the most prevalent sin, even more than greed.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Lust is red.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Bright red.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Blood red.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Red sky at night, sailor’s delight.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Red blooded. Red head. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Red light district.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: That would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: It would be fitting.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re damn right it would.</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Yeah, he was here. This morning.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: It was definitely him? You’re positive?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Yeah. John Doe. Easy name to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What was this job you did for him?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I got a picture of it. That’s what he
came for this morning. I figured he must be one of those art guys… like
those guys who piss in a cup and drink it on stage. Performance art.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, fuck…</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I think I undercharged him. I was up all
night working to finish it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You built this for him? You built
this?</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: I’ve built weirder shit than that.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Somerset… we have a situation.</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Hey, my picture!</p>
<p><strong>wild bill</strong>: Fucking pigs.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: Just wait!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get out of the fucking booth!</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: Just wait! I’ll come out, just wait!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I don’t want to go in there again.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He… he… he made me do it!</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: I have to look at you. I have to
look at you.</p>
<p><strong>first attendant</strong>: You’re not going to want to see
this more than once.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He had a gun! He… he made me do it!</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He made me do it!</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: And… and… and he said… he asked if I was
married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where was the girl?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where was the prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: She was… she was on the bed. She was
just sitting on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who tied her down? You or him?</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: He had a gun. He had a gun, and he made
it happen. He made me do it! He made me put it on… that thing. Oh, God…
he made me wear it. He had the gun in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>crazed man</strong>: The gun was in my throat.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s not going to be a happy ending.
It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If we get him, I’ll be happy enough.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. Face it now. Stop thinking it’s good
guys against the bad guys in this city.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: How can you say that? Especially after
today?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You tell me… when you walk into an
apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or, a wife murdered
her husband in cold blood… and you have to wash the blood off their
children. You put the killer in jail. Who won?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: If I thought like you, I’d have slit my
wrists a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where’s the victory?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You do your job. Follow the law and do the
best you can. It’s all there.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it
turned out he was the devil… if it turned out he was literally Satan,
then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do
these horrible things, right?! But, this is not the devil. It’s only a
man.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Why don’t you shut the fuck up for a while?!
Huh? You make these speeches… like you know everything there is to
know.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think you’re preparing me for the hard
times ahead? You think you’re toughening me up? Well, you’re not! You’re
quitting, fine… but I’m staying to fight.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Who are you fighting for? People don’t
want a champion. They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating
hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? What
burnt you out?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: There’s no one thing, if that’s what you
mean. I just… I can’t live anymore where stupidity is embraced and
nurtured as if it were a virtue.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re so much better than everyone, right?
No one’s worthy of you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Wrong! I sympathize completely. Because if
you can’t win… then, if you don’t ignore everything and everyone around
you, you go insane. It’s easier to smoke crack, and not worry that your
wife and kids are starving to death. And, it’s so much easier to bear a
child till that child finally shuts up, because it takes so much work to
love. And, if you bothered to think about the abuse, and the damage,
you’d be sad.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re talking about people who are mentally
ill. You’re…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No, I am not! I’m talking about common,
everyday life here. Where Ignorance isn’t bliss, it’s a matter of
survival.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen to yourself. You say, “the problem
with people is they don’t care, so I don’t care about people.” But, if
you’re not part of the solution…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: People who are in arguments over their
heads always use meaningless slogans. But, life doesn’t conform to
analogies.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You’re already here, and you’ve been here a
long time. So, there’s a part of you that knows, even if everything you
say is true, none of it matters.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That part of me is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fuck you. You want me to agree with you.
“Yeah, you’re right, Somerset, this place is fucked. Let’s go live in a
fucking log cabin!” Well, I don’t agree with you. You’re quitting, and
it makes me sick. Cause, you’re the best I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Thanks for the beer.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: David?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hello, Somerset. It’s Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yes. Everything’s fine. Could… could you meet
me somewhere. To talk.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I need to talk to someone, Somerset. You’re
the only friend I have here. I don’t know anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: David doesn’t know about this? You haven’t
told him?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I have to tell you, Tracy, I’m not the one
to talk to about this.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I just can’t think straight. I don’t know why
I called you, except I can’t stand to hold it as a secret anymore. I had
to get it out… and I can’t tell David yet. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I… I had a relationship once, very much
like a marriage. And, there was a baby. A long time ago. Things were
good. And I got up one morning, and I went on a case… a murder, like any
other. Except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I felt
this fear and anxiety coming over me. I looked around and I thought, how
can I raise a child here? So, that night, I told her I didn’t want us to
have children, And, over the next few weeks… I convinced her…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I mean, I wore her down… slowly.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I want to have children. But…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can tell you, I know… I’m positive I
made the right decision. I’m positive it was the right thing to do. But,
there’s never a day that goes by that I don’t wish I had decided
differently.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If you… if you decide not to have the
baby… if that’s what you decide, then never tell Mills you were
pregnant. I mean that. Never tell. Your marriage would just wither, and
die altogether.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: But, if you decide to have the baby, then,
at that very instant, when you’re absolutely sure… tell him. Tell him
that exact second. And, spoil that kid every chance you get.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Somerset…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: That’s all the wisdom I can share with
you, Tracy. I barely know you.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Will I see you again, before you leave?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Probably not. But, it’s probably better
that way.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’ve decided… I want to stay on, till this
is over. Till either it’s done, or we can see it will never end.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Oh, you want to stay now?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: One of two things is going to happen.
We’re either going to get John Doe… or, he will finish his series of
seven, and he’ll never be found.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You think if you stay you’re doing me some
big favor?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m requesting you keep me on as your
partner a few more days. You’d be doing me the favor.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You knew I’d say yes.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No. I wasn’t sure at all.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: As soon as this is over, I’ll be gone.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What a great big surprise that is.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Mills and Somerset are on the premises.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Wonder-fucking-ful.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>another cop</strong>: You heard him! Get on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>one cop</strong>: Spread your legs and get your hands out in
front of you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Get down! Face down!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Don’t move. Don’t move a fucking inch.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I want to speak with my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.
That’s why we can’t find a single usable print in his apartment. For a
long time, he’s been cutting before the papillary lines can grow
back.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What about the trace on his bank account? The
guns?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: The orphanage is all we have. His bank
account is only five years old and it started as cash. There’s no credit
history, no employment history. We even tried to trace his furniture.
All we know for sure is he’s wealthy, well educated and totally insane.
We may never know how he got that way.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Because he is John Doe, by choice.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: When do we get to question him?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You don’t. This goes to court now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: This doesn’t make sense, captain. He wouldn’t
just turn himself in!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, there he sits. It’s not supposed to
make sense.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s not finished!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You’re wound way too tight on this,
Mills.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset… help me out here.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Damn it, Somerset. You know Johnny’s fucking
with us. He’s pissing in our faces again!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Slow up. You and I are, probably for the
first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn’t just stop.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Well… what the fuck, man?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: John Doe’s only two murders away from
finishing his masterpiece, right? But, can you even conceive of what
might happen next? I mean, can you tell me how he’s going to go about
it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I can tell you this; I recognize his
lawyer. His name is Mark Swarr. He’s the one who kept Zero out of
prison. We’ll wait for John Doe’s plea.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: My client says there are two more bodies… two
more dead, hidden away. He will take Detective Mills to these bodies,
but only Detective Mills. Only at six o’clock, today.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: He says he admires you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: This is all part of his game plan.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: Mr. Doe claims that if the detective does not
accept this offer, the bodies will never be found.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Frankly, counselor, I’m inclined to let
them rot.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You like what you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Back off, Mills.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: I’m required by law to serve my clients to
the best of my ability, and to serve their interests.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: We don’t make deals like this.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’re going to have to pass.</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: My client… he also wishes that I inform you,
if you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: Let him try. I’d like to see him try!</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: Come now, Martin. Even he knows, with the
nature of these crimes, I could get him off with such a plea.</p>
<p><strong>talbot</strong>: I’m not letting this conviction slide. I can
tell you that, right here and right now!</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: He says, if you accept, under his specific
conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty… right here,
and right now.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Hold on… just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If he were to plead insanity… this
conversation is admissible. The fact that he’s blackmailing us with his
plea…</p>
<p><strong>swarr</strong>: And, my client reminds you, two more people
are dead. The press would have a field day if they found out the police
didn’t seem too concerned about finding them… giving them proper
burial.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ll do it. I want to finish it.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Well… let’s get the fucking lawyer out of
the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing’s going to go
down.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If John Doe’s head splits open, and a
U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No emotion. Stay as cold as ice.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Listen, Somerset… we’ve been through a lot
together. And, I uh…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I would like to make sweet love to you.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Give me a kiss on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Extremely.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Is this wind going to hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Just makes the ride a little more fun.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What’s your story, Johnny? Who are you,
really?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It doesn’t matter who I am. Who I am means
absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What’s your deal? You seem pretty fucking
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I want this to go well. It’s very
important to me, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You want this to go well? What is this?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Turn right on this street. Stay in the
left lane.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Downtown and moving west. Looks like
you’re going to be crossing water.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: If we’re on the bridge, you keep your
distance. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Cross the river before us if
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: For us to go pick up two more dead bodies,
and have that be the end of it… just seems too boring for you.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Wouldn’t be sensational enough.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Wanting people to pay attention, you can’t
just tap them on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Sometimes you have to hit them in the head
with a sledgehammer… and then you get their strict attention.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What are you looking at, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Looking back… at the city proper…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: And yet, no pillar of salt. Lost on you,
isn’t it? You’ve never read the Bible, have you, David?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I remember a lot of people reading it at me
when I was a kid. I preferred the classic comic version myself.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I used to have “Godspell” on an eight- track
tape. Does that count?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You make me sick.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Sit back, freak.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Ignorant heathen.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Right, right. I forgot. You think these
murders were for God. Right? I’m asking you seriously. You really think
what you did was God’s good work?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: The Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Fuck, man… there’s about a thousand
places to be ambushed out here.</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: I don’t see anything… not yet.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: A quick sweep is all we get. Clear out
now. You’re right in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Jesus Christ, Superstar… who in the world do
you think you are? Jesus Christ, Superstar…</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: We can walk from here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You stay out of this unless I call you in,
California. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: You’re in charge.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Alright, Somerset. Going for a stroll.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Lean on your side. Hands behind your head and
lock your fingers together.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: It’s right this way.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: So far, so good.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Tell me where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Slow down, Johnny. Stop right there. I said
stop!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’ll blow your head off right now!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: What…</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Motherfucker! No!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: He’s gone, Somerset! He’s in the water!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m going in!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I have to go in after him!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Somerset, what’s going on down
there?!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Come on, Johnny! I’m right here!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: God damn it! Let’s do something!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Somerset said wait!</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: Fuck that! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>california</strong>: I don’t know! Just go!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Come on! Let’s do it! You and me!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m not going to let you win this!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Mills! Pull out!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Pull out now!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Hello, Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Where’s David?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: He’s here. With me.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: What do I want? The same you… I want an
ending. Stay where you are. Put your gun on the floor and slide it all
the way down here.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I want to see him. Show me Mills.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You’re an intelligent man, Somerset. You
understand what you’re a part of, don’t you? When this is finished, it
will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality. And, no
one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’re a murderer. That’s all. The only
way you’ve distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: You know that’s not true. You know.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’re killing innocent people, and I
should admire you? You’re doing it because it gives you pleasure. That’s
the only purpose… your sick pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I won’t deny my personal desires. I
won’t.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: But, I don’t mourn the victims in this any
more than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: All you’ve done is cause more misery and
pain! You’ve given people all the more reason to believe there is no
God!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Somerset?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Do you really think I’m just going to let
this happen?! You think I’m going to let him die?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: How can you speak of God, Somerset? When
was the last time you spoke His name?</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: When did you last speak His name? Was it
in prayer? Or, did you say the Lord’s name after you stubbed your big
toe? Or, did you use His name to curse another man?</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: I’m going to kill you, Johnny. I’m going to
see you dead.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: The irony, David, is that you policemen
and I want the same things. But, you are so short sighted. In this city,
where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner… and in every
home, we want repentance.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: We want good over evil. We want values
instilled in the children. We want a world where a man or woman can lead
a decent life. Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge,
piety, and fear of the Lord. Such simple concepts. Why are they
non-existent?</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Let him go, God damn you.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: There were two men once, who had wonderful
gardens. Two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could
see. Beautiful gardens… the fragrance was inspiration in itself.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: But, both gardens were beset by problems.
Weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and
diseases. The gardens started to turn putrid. And, one man fought to
save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was. Everyday
he cut the weeds, and killed the insects. Fought the diseases.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: That man never had a beautiful garden
again.</p>
<p><strong>mills</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: The other man plowed his garden under. He
plowed it under the soil. He started over.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Stay there, Somerset. Or, I’ll kill him
right now.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Alright… you don’t have to do this, John.
You’ve already made your point.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: Do you think I chose this? Can you even
begin to understand how painful my existence has been? It’s like… like
having every sense heightened beyond comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: So that the stench of the street coats
your throat like bile. So, sugar is so sweet it… it makes your bones
ache to the marrow.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You’re insane. That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: No! You’re wrong!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I was chosen. And I’ve wished a thousand
times I could have been a normal man. Like David Mills, a common man…
with a common life. But, wishing that is my sin. I can’t have it and I
shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Don’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>john doe</strong>: I meant what I said. I admire David Mills.
I envy David Mills. Envy is my sin.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: David, get out!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: David… David? Please…</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t know if I should do this. We found
the motel room Doe must have been staying in after you found his
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Anyway… we found this in his
belongings.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: I wish I could say something… Something
to… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: We’ll keep in touch. I’ll come visit.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ll write to you when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Take care of yourself. Take care of the
baby.</p>
<p><strong>mover</strong>: That’s all, Mrs. Mills. We got
everything.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Goodbye, Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Goodbye, Somerset.</p>
<p><strong>somerset</strong>: Oh… man…</p>
