<p><strong>title</strong>: “He who makes a beast of himself</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge
of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I remember saying something like: “I feel a
bit lightheaded. Maybe you should drive…”</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Suddenly there was a terrible roar all around
us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and
screeching and diving around the car…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: … and a voice was screaming: Holy Jesus! What
are these goddamn animals?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What are you yelling about?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never mind. It’s your turn to drive.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No point mentioning these bats. I thought. The
poor bastard will see them soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We had two bags of grass, seventy- five
pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt
shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers,
downers, screamers, laughers… Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a
case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not that we needed all that for the trip, but
once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to
push it as far as you can.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The only thing that really worried me was the
ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and
depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we’d get
into that rotten stuff pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>radio news</strong>: An overdose of heroin was listed as the
official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body
was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: “One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.”</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see
those goddamn bats.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Let’s give that boy a lift.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We can’t stop here - this is bat country!</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Hot damn! I never rode in a convertible
before!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Is that right? Well, I guess you’re about
ready, eh?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We’re your friends. We’re not like the
others.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No more of that talk or I’ll put the leeches
on you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How long could we maintain, I wondered. How
long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will
he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the
Manson family.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Would he make that grim connection when my
attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on
the car?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If so - well, we’ll just have to cut his head
off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can’t
turn him loose. He’d report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law
enforcement agency, and they’ll run us down like dogs…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus! Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: It’s okay. He’s admiring the shape of your
skull.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe I better have a chat with this boy I
thought. Perhaps if I explain things, he’ll rest easy…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s good. Because I want you to have all
the background. This is a very ominous assignment – with overtones of
extreme personal danger. I’m a Doctor of Journalism! This is important,
goddamnit! This is a true story!…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Keep your hands off my fucking neck!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Our vibrations were getting nasty – but why?
Was there no communication in this car? Had we deteriorated to the level
of dumb beasts?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I want you to understand that this man at the
wheel is my attorney! He’s not just some dingbat I found on the Strip.
He’s a foreigner. I think he’s probably Samoan. But it doesn’t matter,
does it? Are you prejudiced?</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Hell, no!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I didn’t think so. Because in spite of his
race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about
this beer. You want one? How about some ether?</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never mind. Let’s get right to the heart of
this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of
the Beverly Wills Hotel…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: … in the patio section, of course, drinking
Singapore Slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish
realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m telling you, the Salazar story is getting
too complicated. The weasels have started closing in.</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Perhaps this is the call you’ve been waiting
for all this time, sir…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: That was headquarters. They want me to go to
Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named
Lacerda. He’ll have the details. All I have to do is check into my sound
proof suite and he’ll seek me out.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one
sounds like real trouble! You’re going to need plenty of legal advice
before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that
you’ll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And
then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts…
This blows my weekend, because naturally I’ll have to go with you – and
we’ll have to arm ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why not? If a thing’s worth doing, it’s worth
doing right.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream
in action! We’d be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to
the end.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is
this?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The Mint 400! The richest off-road race for
motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized sport! – a
fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the
luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas… at least that’s
what the press release says.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We’re going to have to drum it up on our own.
Pure Gonzo Journalism.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Getting hold of the drugs and shirts had been
no problem…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: … but the car and tape recorder were not easy
things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We’ll be there
in thirty minutes. I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and
the proper coloring. What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit
card! Do you realize who the fuck you’re talking to?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t take any guff from these swine. Now we
need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of
those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for
picking up conversations in oncoming cars.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We won’t make the nut unless we have
unlimited credit.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We will. You Samoans are all the same. You
have no faith in the essential decency of the white man’s culture.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The store was closed, but the salesman said he
would wait, if we hurried…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But we were delayed en route when a Stingray
in front of us killed a pedestrain.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We had trouble, again, at the car rental
agency.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Say… uh… you fellas are going to be careful
with this car, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well, good god! You just backed over that two
foot concrete abutment and you didn’t even slow down! Forty-five in
reverse! And you barely missed the pump!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No harm done. I always test the transmission
that way. The rear end. For stress factors.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Say. Are you fellows drinking?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not me. We’re responsible people.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: There’s another worrier. He’s probably all
cranked up on speed.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We spent the rest of that night rounding up
materials and packing the car. Then we ate some mescaline and went
swimming.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Our trip was different. It was to be a classic
affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a
gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this
country. But only for those with true grit…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: …and we’re chock full of that!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Damn right!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My attorney understands this concept, despite
his racial handicap. But do you?!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He said he understood, but I could see in his
eyes that he didn’t. He was lying to me.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: My heart!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Where’s the medicine?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The medicine? Yes, it’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t worry, this man has a bad heart… Angina
Pectoris. But we have a cure for it.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels
like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What’s
wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your
language! You’re talking to a Doctor of Journalism!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody
call the police! We need help!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Pay no attention to this swine. He can’t
handle the medicine.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: The truth is we’re going to Vegas to croak a
scag baron named Savage Henry. I’ve known him for years but he ripped us
off – and you know what that means, right?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Savage Henry has cashed his check! We’re
going to rip his lungs out!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And eat them! That bastard won’t get away with
this! What’s going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can
get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I
like you guys. Don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Good riddance. That boy made me nervous. Did
you see his eyes? Jesus, this is good medicine.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Move over!! We have to get out of California
before that kid finds a cop!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It was absolutely imperative that we get to
the Mint Hotel before the deadline for press registration. Otherwise, we
might have to pay for our suite.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to
us?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: God didn’t do that! You did it! You’re a
fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out
here. They’ll pick your bones clean before morning.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You whore!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Here – chew this. It’s your half of the
acid.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How long do I have?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney,
I advise you to drive at top speed. It’ll be a goddamn miracle if we can
get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that?
Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit
capital fraud and a head full of acid.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Thirty minutes. It was going to be very
close.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I need this, right?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I’ll remember your face.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There is no way of explaining the terror I
felt.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I was pouring sweat. My blood is too thick for
Nevada. I’ve never been able to properly explain myself in this
climate.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Be quiet, be calm… name, rank, and press
affiliation, nothing else…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: …ignore this terrible drug, pretend it’s not
happening…</p>
<p><strong>reservations clerk</strong>: Your suite’s not ready yet. But
there’s somebody looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I can handle this. This man has a bad heart,
but I have plenty of medicine. My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite
at once. We’ll be in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the
side. Who’s Lacerda, he’s waiting for us in a room on the twelfth
floor?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lacerda?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I couldn’t remember. The name rang a bell, but
I couldn’t concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around
us…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Order some golf shoes. Otherwise, we’ll never
get out of this place alive. It’s impossible to walk in this muck – no
footing at all…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile
zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won’t be
long before they tear us to shreds!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: If you think we’re in trouble now wait until
you see what’s happening in the elevators.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.
I told him I knew what he was up to… He says he’s a photographer! But
when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we’re onto him!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But what about our room? And the golf
shoes?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Holy shit! Look at that bunch over there!
They’ve spotted us!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That’s the press table. Where you have to
sign in for our credentials. Shit, let’s get it over with. You handle
that, and I’ll check on the room.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, no. Don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>bell boy</strong>: Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
cocktails.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There’s a big… machine in the sky… some kind
of electric snake…</p>
<p><strong>bell boy</strong>: … a quart of rum…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: … coming straight at us.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Shoot it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not yet. I want to study its habits.</p>
<p><strong>bell boy</strong>: … and nine fresh grapefruit.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Vitamin C. We’ll need all we can get.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Look, you’ve got to stop this talk about
snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff. It’s making me sick!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You bastard! They’ll never let us back in
that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving
that goddamn marlin spike around – yelling about reptiles! You scared
the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell,
the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of
there…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Oh my God! Who’s that?!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Duke? I’m Lacerda your photographer. Got
your press passes? Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in.
My, what a sight!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Husquavarnas. Yamahas. Kawaskis. Maicos.
Pursang. Swedish Fireballs. Couple of Triumphs, here and there a CZ. All
very fast. What a race it’s gonna be.</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Well, we start at dawn. Get a good night’s
sleep. I know I will.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s good…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I think he’s lying to us. I could see it in
his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They’ll probably have a big net for us when we
show up.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Turn that shit off!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never lose sight of the primary
responsibility. Cover the story. But what was the story? Nobody had
bothered to say.</p>
<p><strong>race</strong>: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted
MOTORSPORT TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The racers were ready at dawn. Very tense. But
the race didn’t start until nine so we had three long hours to kill.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Those of us who had been up all night were in
no mood for coffee and donuts. We wanted strong drink. We were, after
all, the Absolute Cream of the National Sporting Press and we were
gathered here, in Las Vegas, for a very special assignment. And when it
comes to things like this you don’t fool around.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: See…“Kill the body and the head will die”… the
Frazier/Ali fight…</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: A proper end to the 60’s… Ali
beaten by a human hamburger!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And both Kennedy’s murdered by mutants.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: That’s it! They’re starting!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Well, that’s that. They’ll be back in an
hour or so. Let’s go back to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Group 2!</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Group 3!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There was something like 190 more bikes
waiting to start. They were due to go off 10 at a time every 2
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Beer!</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: God damn! What day is this – Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: More like Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Hah! That’s a bitch, ain’t it? Last night I
was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin’ the Mint 400
today, so I says to my old lady, “Man, I’m goin’.” So she gives me a lot
of crap about it, so I start slappin’ her around, and the next thing you
know two guys I never seen before are beating me stupid.</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Group 4!</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a
bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute
all I could think was, “O Jesus, who’s divorcing me this time?” But then
I remembered, by God! I was here for the Mint 400. And, man, I tell you,
it’s wonderful to be here. Just wonderful to be here with you
people.</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: Senzaman wassyneeds!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Hell yes! Bring us ten!</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Group 5!</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: I’ll back it!</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: This is a magic moment in sport!
It may never come again! I once did the Triple Crown, but it was nothing
like this.</p>
<p><strong>frog-eyed woman</strong>: Please stand up! You’re a
correspondent for a major national magazine who’s name we can’t get
clearance for! Please! You’d be a very handsome man if you’d just stand
up!</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: Listen, madam. I’m damn near
intolerably handsome down here where I am. You’d go crazy if I stood
up!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Club soda, please.</p>
<p><strong>frog-eyed woman</strong>: Please! I love Life!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Man, it’s great out there!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lunatics.</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Group 6!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: Meet you outside!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: By 10 they were spread out all over the
course. It was no longer a race, now it was an Endurance Contest. The
idea of trying to “cover this race” in any conventional press sense was
absurd.</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: It’s great, isn’t it?! Jump in!</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: I’ll just keep trying different combos of
film and lenses till I find one that works in this dust!</p>
<p><strong>battle hymn</strong>: “…As we go marching on When I reach my
final campground, in that land beyond the sun, And the Great Commander
asks me…” “Did you fight or did you run?”</p>
<p><strong>battle hymn</strong>: “We responded to their rifle fire with
everything we had…”</p>
<p><strong>dune buggy driver</strong>: Where’s the damn race?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Beats me. We’re just good patriotic Americans
like yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dune buggy driver</strong>: What outfit you fellas with?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The sporting press. We’re friendlies. Hired
geeks.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If you want a good chase, you should get after
that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He’s the man
responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.</p>
<p><strong>dune buggy passenger #2</strong>: A black jeep, you say?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Take me back to the pits.</p>
<p><strong>lacerda</strong>: No, no – we have to go on. We need total
coverage.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It was time. I felt, for an Agonizing
Reappraisal of the whole scene. The race was definitely under way. I had
witnessed the start; I was sure of that much. But what now?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Turn up the radio! Turn up the tape machine!
Roll the windows down. Let’s taste this cool desert wind! Aaah, yes!
This is what it’s all about!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Total control now. Tooling along the main drag
on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red
convertible… stoned, ripped, twisted… Good people!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: How about “Nickel Nick’s Slot Arcade?” “Hot
Slots,” that sounds heavy. Twenty-nine cent hotdogs…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to
entertain ourselves, or to do the job?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: To do the job, of course. Here we go… a Crab
Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: As your attorney I advise you to drive over
to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo. He’s in the Blue Room with
his Royal Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Why what?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to
watch a fucking corpse. I don’t know about you, but in my line of
business it’s important to be Hep.</p>
<p><strong>doorman #1</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>doorman #2</strong>: You can’t park here!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why not? Is this not a reasonable place to
park?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We want this car parked! We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show. We’re friends of Debbie’s.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was
quick thinking.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What do you expect? I’m your attorney. You
owe me five bucks. I want it now.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This was Bob Hope’s turf. Frank Sinatra’s.
Spiro Agnew’s. It seemed inappropriate to be haggling about nickel/dime
bribes for the parking lot attendant.</p>
<p><strong>wine-colored tuxedo</strong>: Sorry, full house.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Goddamnit, we drove all the way from L.A.</p>
<p><strong>wine-colored tuxedo</strong>: I said there are no seats left…
at any price.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Fuck seats! We’re old friends of Debbie’s. I
used to romp with her.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: After a lot of bad noise, he let us in for
nothing provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Jesus creeping shit!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that
Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We wandered into a fucking time capsule!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We wandered into a fucking time capsule!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What’s this?…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That scum…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: SCUM! I know where you live! I’ll find you
and burn down your fucking house!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This is the place. They’ll never fuck with us
here.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Where’s the ether? This mescaline isn’t
working.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ah, devil ether. It makes you behave like the
village drunkard in some early Irish novel… total loss of all basic
motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue – The mind recoils
in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is
interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this
terrible way, but you can’t control it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You approach the turnstiles and know that when
you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won’t let you
inside… but when you get there, everything goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think:
What’s happening here? What’s going on? Then you hear yourself
mumbling.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch
out!… Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born… Born?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Get sheep over side… women and children to
armored car… orders from Captain Zeep.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas. In
this town they love a drunk. Fresh meat. So they put us through the
turnstiles and turned us loose inside.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep world
would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This was the
Sixth Reich.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: A drug person can learn to cope with things
like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in
her teeth but, nobody should be asked to handle this trip.</p>
<p><strong>fairground barker</strong>: Stand in front of this fantastic
machine, my friend. For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200
hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>fairground barker</strong>: 99 cents more for a voice
message. Say whatever you want, fella. They’ll hear you, don’t worry
about that. Remember, you’ll be 200 feet tall!</p>
<p><strong>another barker</strong>: Step right up! Shoot the pasties off
the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I hate to say this, but this place is getting
to me. I think I’m getting The Fear.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Nonsense. We came here to find the American
Dream, and now we’re right in the vortex you want to quit. You must
realize that we’ve found the Main Nerve.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That’s what gives me The Fear.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar
Bear.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Please, don’t tell me those things… Not now.
This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not much. Why?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Calm down. You’ll be straight in a few
hours.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: No. This is serious. One more hour in this
town and I’ll kill somebody!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: OK. I’ll lend you some money. Let’s go outside
and see how much we have left.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Can we make it?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That depends on how many people we fuck with
between here and the door.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I want to leave fast.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly.
It’s going to be a long walk.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Do they pay you to screw that bear?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He’s just kidding. Come on, Doc – lets go
downstairs and gamble.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: When does this thing stop?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It won’t stop. It’s not ever going to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t move you’ll come around.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You fell. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: OK. You stay here and go to jail. I’m
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me
in the back.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you
for what you said to the waitress.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Good God! Let’s get out of here! Where’s the
elevator?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t go near that elevator. That’s just what
they want us to do… trap us in a steel box and take us down to the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t run. They’d like any excuse to shoot
us.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You drive! I think there’s something wrong
with me.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Those bastards have changed the lock on us.
They probably searched the room. Jesus, we’re finished!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Bolt everything! Use all chains!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Where did this one come from?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s Lacerda’s room.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yeah… I thought we might need it…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Let’s go up there and blast him out of bed
with the fire hose.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I
get the feeling that he’s avoiding us for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Don’t kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a
bitch is dangerous. He’s watching us like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He told me he was turning in early…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That dirty bastard! I knew it! He’s got hold
of my woman!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That little blonde groupie with the film crew?
You think he sodomized her?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That’s right, laugh about it! You goddamn
honkies are all the same!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Where’d you get that knife?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Room service sent it up. I wanted something
to cut the limes.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What limes?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: They didn’t have any. They don’t grow in the
desert.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That dirty toad bastard! I knew I should have
taken him out when I had the chance. Now he has her.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I remember the girl. We’d had a problem with
her in the elevator a few hours earlier: my attention had made a fool of
himself.</p>
<p><strong>blonde tv reporter</strong>: You must be a rider. What class
are you in?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Class? What the fuck do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>blonde tv reporter</strong>: What do you ride? We’re filming
the race for a TV series – maybe we can use you.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Use me?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mother of God, I thought. Here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I ride the BIG ONES! The really BIG
fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The Vincent Black Shadow. We’re with the
Factory Team.</p>
<p><strong>tv cameraman</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but I think
there’s some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker in this car who needs his
face cut open. You cheap honky faggots! Which one of you wants to get
cut?!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Spooked! They were spooked! Like rats in a
death cage!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Goddamn. It’s serious now. That girl
understood. She fell in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Let’s go up there and castrate that
fucker!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Have you made a deal with him? Did you put
him on to her?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Look you better put that blade away and get
your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: One of the things you learn, after years of
dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person,
but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it’s waving a
razor-sharp hunting knife in your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>magazine reporter</strong>: Las Vegas at dawn. The racers are
still asleep, the dust is still on the desert, fifty thousand dollars in
prize money, slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb’s fabulous
Mint Hotel…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Who are these people? These faces! Where do
they come from? They look like caricatures of used car dealers from
Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of
them at four-thirty on a Monday morning. Still humping the American
dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last
minute predawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You bastards!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No. Calm down. Learn to ENJOY losing.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You ate ALL THIS ACID?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You evil son of a bitch. You better hope
there’s some Thorazine in that bag, because if there’s not, you’re in
bad trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What tape?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Jefferson Airplane. “White Rabbit.” I want a
rising sound.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re doomed. I’m leaving here in two hours
and then they’re going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of
you with big saps. Right there in that tub.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I dig my own graves. Green water and the
White Rabbit. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can
you give me two hours? That’s all I ask – just two hours to sleep before
tomorrow. I suspect it’s going to be a very difficult day.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Of course, I’m your attorney, I’ll give you
all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour – but you’ll be
wanting a cushion, so, why don’t you just lay one of those $100 bills
down there beside the radio, and fuck off?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How about a check?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Whatever’s right.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Help! You bastard! I need help!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Shit, he’s killing himself!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I want that fucking radio!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t touch it! Get back in that tub!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it
roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that
fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to
THROW THAT FUCKING</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not me. It would blast you through the wall –
stone dead in ten seconds and they’d make me explain it!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: BULLSHIT! Don’t make me use this.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Do it! I want to get HIGHER!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Okay. You’re right. This is probably the only
solution. Let me make sure I have it all lined up. You want me to throw
this thing into the tub when “WHITE RABBIT” peaks. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was
going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You bastard! You’d do that, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why worry? You’ll like it. Nothing in the
world like a Mace high. Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry
heaves…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You cheap honky sonofabitch…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were
asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do,
goddamnit, is call the police!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: The cops?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There’s no choice. I wouldn’t dare go to sleep
with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice
me up with that goddamn knife!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Who said anything about slicing you up? I
just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Get back in that tub. Eat some reds and try to
calm down. Smoke some grass, shoot some smack – shit, do whatever you
have to do, but let me get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hell, yes. You really need some sleep. You
have to work. Goddamn. What a bummer. Try to rest. Don’t let me keep you
up.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. Just
another ugly refugee from the Love Generation.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My attorney had never been able to accept the
notion – often espoused by former drug abusers – that you can get a lot
higher without drugs than with them. And neither have I, for that
matter.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I recall one night in the Matrix. There I was
– a victim of the Drug Explosion. A natural street freak, just eating
whatever came by.</p>
<p><strong>road-person</strong>: Anybody want some L…S…D…? I got all the
makin’s right here. All I need is a place to cook.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I decided to eat only half at first. Good
thinking. But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>musician</strong>: What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is
LSD.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: With a bit of luck his life was ruined –
forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite
bars, men in red Pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from
things he’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Strange memories on this nervous night in Las
Vegas. Has it been five years? Six? It seems like a lifetime – the kind
of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was
a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no
mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that
you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever
it meant.</p>
<p><strong>need that. our energy would simply</strong>: prevail. We had
all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful
wave…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: So now, less than five years later, you can go
up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind
of eyes you can almost see the high water mark – that place where the
wave finally broke and rolled back.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The decision to flee came suddenly. Or maybe
not.</p>
<p><strong>bell boy</strong>: Room service!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe I’d planned it all along –
subconsciously waiting for the right moment. The bill was a factor, I
think. Because I had no money to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Our room service tabs had been running
somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour, for forty-eight consecutive
hours. Incredible. How could it happen?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But by the time I asked this question, there
was no one around to answer.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My attorney was gone. He must have sensed
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Panic.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It crept up my spine like first rising vibes
of an acid frenzy. All these horrible realities began to dawn on me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Here I was, alone in Las Vegas, with this
goddamned incredibly expensive car, completely twisted on drugs, no
cash, no story for the magazine. And on top of everything else I had a
gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I didn’t even know who had won the race. Maybe
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How would Horatio Alger have handled this
situation?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stay calm. Stay calm. I’m a relatively
respectable citizen – a multiple felon, perhaps, but certainly not
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Luckily, I had taken the soap and grapefruit
and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier. Now it was only a
matter of slipping the noose…</p>
<p><strong>clerk’s voice</strong>: Mr. Duke! We’ve been looking for
you!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The game was up! They had me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well, why not? Many fine books have been
written in prison.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it
isn’t for you. It’s for somebody named Thompson, but it says ‘care of
Raoul Duke’. does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yes… It makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I checked the register for this man Thompson.
We don’t show him but I figured he might be part of your team.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He is. Don’t worry, I’ll get it to him.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What confused us was Dr. Gonzo’s signature on
the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You did the right thing. Never try to
understand a press message. About half the time we use codes –
especially with Dr. Gonzo.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Awake? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well… the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to
meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large
accounts… put them on a personal basis… just a chat and a handshake, you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Of course. But if I were you, I’d leave the
Doctor alone until after he’s eaten breakfast. He’s a very crude
man.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: But he will be available? Perhaps later this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was
actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the
names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: There’s no hurry! The race is over!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Let’s have lunch!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Righto!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear
and loathing – intolerable vibrations in this place. Get out! The
weasels were closing in. I could smell the ugly brutes. Flee!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five
more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get
rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You evil bastard! This is your work! You’d
better take care of me, Lord… because if you don’t you’re going to have
me on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Few people understand the psychology of
dealing with a Highway Traffic Cop. Your normal speeder will panic and
immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It arouses contempt in the cop heart.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Make the bastard chase you. He will follow.
But he won’t know what to make of your blinker signal that says you’re
about to turn right.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This is to let him know you’re looking for a
proper place to pull off and talk.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It will take him a moment to realize that he
is about to make 180 degree turn at speed… but you will be ready for it,
braced for the G’s and the fast heel toe work.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Just what the FUCK did you think
you were doing?!</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: May I see your license.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Of course, officer.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I knew I was fucked.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Could I have that, please?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why not? It was getting warm anyway.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: You realize…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah. I know. I’m guilty. I understand that. I
knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I’m a fucking
criminal.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: That’s a strange attitude.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: You know – I get the feeling you
could use a nap. There’s a rest area up ahead. Why don’t you pull over
and sleep a few hours?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: A nap won’t help. I’ve been awake for too long
– three or four nights. I can’t even remember. If I go to sleep now, I’m
dead for twenty hours.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Okay. Here’s how it is. What goes
into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you… for driving too
fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area…
your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I
make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there
for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Not my jurisdiction. The city
limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it
that far?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll try. I’ve been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. I’ve heard a lot about it.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman</strong>: Excellent seafood. With a mind
like yours, you’ll probably want to try the land-crab. Try the Majestic
Diner.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I felt raped. The Pig had done me on all
fronts, and now he was going off to chuckle about it – on the west side
of town, waiting for me to make a run for L.A.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Great Jesus, it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They’ve nailed me! I’m trapped in some
stinking desert crossroads called Baker. I don’t have much time. The
fuckers are closing in. They’ll hunt me down like a beast!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Who? You sound a little paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What are you doing in Baker? Didn’t you get
my telegram?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What? Fuck telegrams. I’m in trouble. You
worthless bastard. I’ll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the
car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here
you’ll be disbarred!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You’re supposed to be in Vegas. We have a
suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo’s voice</strong>: You brainless scumbag! You’re
supposed to be covering the National District Attorney’s conference! I
made all the reservations… rented a white Cadillac convertible… the
whole thing is arranged! What the hell are you doing out there in the
middle of the fucking desert?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never mind. It’s all a big joke. I’m actually
sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo. I’m talking from a portable
phone. Some dwarf brought it out from the casino. I have total credit!
Can you grasp that? Don’t come anywhere near this place! Foreigners
aren’t welcome here!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well. This is how the world works.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: All energy flows according to the whims of the
Great Magnet.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What a fool I was to defy Him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never cross the Great Magnet. I understood
this now… … and with understanding came a sense of almost terminal
relief.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I had to get rid of The Shark. Too many people
might recognize it… …especially the Vegas Police. Luckily, my credit
card was still technically valid.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This was a superior machine – ten grand worth
of gimmicks and high price special effects. The rear windows leapt up
with a touch like frogs in a dynamited pond. The dashboard was full of
esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If the Pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt
the Drug Culture should be represented as well… and there was a certain
bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas
hotel and then just wheeling across town and checking into another.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over
America. Why not? Move confidently into their midst.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My arrival was badly timed.</p>
<p><strong>police chief</strong>: What do you mean I’m too late to
register? I’m a police chief. From Michigan. Look, fella, I told you. I
have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. You’re on the “late list.”
Your reservations were transferred to the… ah… Moonlight Motel, which is
out on Paradise Boulevard…</p>
<p><strong>police chief</strong>: I’ve already paid for my goddamn
room!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It’s actually a very fine place of lodging
and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and…</p>
<p><strong>police chief</strong>: You dirty little faggot! Call the
manager! I’m tired of listening to this dogshit!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m so sorry, sir. May I call you a cab?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was
really saying…</p>
<p>****: Listen, you fuzzy little shithead – I’ve been fucked around, in
my time, by a fairly good cross- section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
cops and now it’s MY turn. “Fuck you, officer, I’m in charge here, and
I’m telling you we don’t have room for you.”</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Say. I hate to interrupt, but I wonder if
maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way. Name’s
Raoul Duke – Raoul Duke. My attorney made the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Certainly, Mr. Duke!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My bags are out there in that white Cadillac
convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey,
two fifths of Baccardi, and a night’s worth of ice delivered to my room,
please?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Don’t worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy
your stay.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ah, home at last!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You degenerate pig!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: It can’t be helped. This is Lucy. You
know–like “Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.”</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Lucy! Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what
happened at the airport! No more of that, okay?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Lucy… this is my client. This is Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist. He’s paying for this suite, Lucy. He’s on our
side.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Mr. Duke is my friend. He loves artists.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
Streisand.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I drew these from TV.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Fantastic. She came all the way down here
from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra. We’re going over to
the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary. I
hadn’t counted on this. Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some
kind of preternatural courtship.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well, I guess they brought the car round by
now. LET’S GET THE STUFF</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Absolutely, LET’S GET THE STUFF. Now, we’ll
be right back. Don’t answer the phone if it rings.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: God bless.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: WELL? What are your plans?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Plans?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all
that acid. You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before
I realized… she’s a religious freak… Jesus, she’s never even had a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well… It’ll probably work out. We can keep her
loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Listen, she’s running away from home for
something like the fifth time in six months. It’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: She’s perfect for this gig. These cops will go
fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.
We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of
Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her… Hell she’s
strong; she’ll hold her own.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I
never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It’s straight economics. This girl is a
god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: NO! Stop talking like that.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I figure she can do about four at a time.
Christ, if we keep her full of acid that’s more like two grand a day.
Maybe three.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You filthy bastard. I should cave your
fucking head in.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: In a few hours, she’ll probably be sane enough
to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy
recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her
liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised
member.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to
help her!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’ll go straight to the gas chamber. And
even if you manage to beat that, they’ll send you back to Nevada for
Rape and Consensual Sodomy. She’s got to go.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Shit, it doesn’t pay to try to help somebody
these days.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The only alternative was to take her out to
the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit
heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We have to cut her loose. She’s got two
hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana,
where she lives, and turn her in.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What?… What kind of goddamn monster are
you?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: It just occurred to me, that she has no
witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Us?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Hotel Americana? I need a reservation. For my
niece. Listen, I need her treated very gently. She’s an artist, and
might seem a trifle highstrung…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Okay, Lucy, it’s time to go meet Barbra…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both
our necks. There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope
her memory was fucked.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Well that’s that. Take off slowly. Don’t
attract attention.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make
sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I’d be there myself in an
hour, and if she wasn’t, I’d come back out here and rip his lungs
out.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s good. You can’t be subtle in this
town.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: As your attorney, I advise you to tell me
where you put the goddamn mescaline.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe we should take it easy tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Right. Let’s find a good seafood restaurant
and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Come on, we’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: This goddamn mescaline. Why the fuck can’t
they make it a little less pure? Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or
something.</p>
<p><strong>executive director</strong>: booming over the</p>
<p><strong>a big mixed crowd: top level straight cops, undercover
narcs</strong>: AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES – beards, mustaches and
super-Mod dress. Just because you’re a cop, doesn’t mean you can’t be
WITH IT! However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I
didn’t believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They’re actually nice people when you get to
know them.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Man, I know these people in my goddamn
blood!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t mention that word around here. You’ll
get them excited.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: This is a fucking nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Right. Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb
freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you’re
partying with a thousand cops.</p>
<p><strong>dr. blumquist</strong>: We must come to terms with the Drug
Culture in the country… country… country…</p>
<p><strong>dr. blumquist</strong>: The reefer butt is called a “roach,”
because it resembles a cockroach… cockroach… cockroach…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What the fuck are these people talking about?
You’d have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn
cockroach!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It was clear that we had stumbled into a
prehistoric gathering.</p>
<p><strong>dr. blumquist</strong>: Now, there are four states of being
in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square.
The square is seldom if ever cool. He is not “with it,” that is, he
doesn’t know “what’s happening.” But if he manages to figure it out, he
moves up a notch to “hip.”</p>
<p><strong>dr. blumquist</strong>: And if he can bring himself to
approve of what is happening, he becomes “groovy.” After that, with much
luck and perseverance, he can rise to the rank of “cool.” A cool guy…
cool guy… cool guy…</p>
<p><strong>cop in back</strong>: Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
anthropologist, Margaret Mead’s strange behavior of late might possibly
be explained by a private marijuana addiction?</p>
<p><strong>dr. blumquist</strong>: I really don’t know, but at her age,
if she did smoke grass, she’d have one hell of a trip!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste
my time than listening to this bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>cop in back</strong>: Down in front!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Fuck you! I have to get out! I don’t belong
here!</p>
<p><strong>cop in back</strong>: Good riddance!</p>
<p><strong>know your dope fiend! your life</strong>: MAY DEPEND ON IT!
You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his
knuckles will be white from inner tension…</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: … and his pants will be crusted with
semen from constantly jacking off when he can’t find a rape victim…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Pardon me, I feel sick.</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: He will stagger and babble when
questioned. He will not respect your badge. The Dope Fiend fears
nothing. He will attack, for no reason, with every weapon at his command
– including yours…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Sorry, sick… Beg pardon! Feeling sick…</p>
<p><strong>film narrator</strong>: BEWARE. Any officer apprehending a
suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.
One stitch in time will usually save nine on you.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: I’m a whiskey man myself. We don’t have much
trouble from drugs where I come from…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You will. One of these nights you’ll wake up
and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Naw!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: They’ll climb right into your bedroom and sit
on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife’s
chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Not down in my parts.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Rum and ice, please.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: You’re another one of these California boys.
Your friend here’s been tellin’ us about dope fiends.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They’re everywhere. Nobody’s safe. And sure as
hell not in the South. They like warm weather… You’d never believe it.
In L.A. it’s out of control. First it was drugs, now it’s
witchcraft.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Witchcraft? Shit, you can’t mean it!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Read the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Man, you don’t know trouble until you have to
face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Naw! That’s science fiction stuff!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not where we operate.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan
worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the
blood. They’ll take people right off the street if they have to.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Just the other day we had a case where they
grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald’s hamburger stand. She was a
waitress, about sixteen years old… with a lot of people watching,
too!</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: What happened? What did they do to her?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her
goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds
of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: And nobody did anything?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What could they do? The guy that took the head
was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two
Lugers, and the others had M-16s.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: They just ran back out into Death Valley –
you know, where Manson turned up…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Like big lizards.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: … and every one of them stacked naked…</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Naked!?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Naked.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yeh, naked!… except for the weapons.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They were all veterans.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Veterans?!!!?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the
Marines.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: A major!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We know where he lives, but we can’t get near
the house.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Naw! Not a major.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: He wanted the pineal gland.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That’s how he got so big. When he quit the
Marines he was just a little guy.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Usually, it’s whole families. During the
night. Most of them don’t even wake up until they feel their heads going
– and then, of course, it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Happens every day.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Three more rums. Plenty of ice. Maybe a
handful of lime chunks.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Are you guys with the police convention
upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: We sure are, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I thought so. I never heard that kind of
talk around here before. Jesus Christ! How do you guys stand that kind
of work?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: We like it. It’s groovy.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’s wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to
do it.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hurry up with those drinks. We’re thirsty.
Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because
everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner
or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards
were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep ’em under surveillance. They
didn’t roam around much… But now Jesus, it seems nobody’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You’re going to need to take the bull by the
horns – go to the mat with this scum.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You know what I mean. We’ve done it before
and we can damn well do it again!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of
them. That’s what we’re doing in California.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Sure. It’s all on the Q.T., but everybody who
matters is with us all the way down the line.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We keep it quiet. It’s not the kind of thing
you’d want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: Hell, no. We’d never hear the goddamn end of
it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Dobermans don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Sometimes it’s easier to just rip out the
backstraps.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They’ll fight like hell if you try to take the
head without the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>da</strong>: God almighty! I don’t think I should tell my
wife about this. She’d never understand. You know how women are.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Just be thankful your heart is young and
strong.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’s the message? My light is blinking.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message:
“Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.”</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lucy called.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I’m sorry we were
cut off a moment ago… I thought I should call again, because I was
wondering…</p>
<p><strong>what?</strong>: What was that crazy bitch said to him?
There’s a war on, man! People are being killed!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Killed?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Oh… yes… yes… This terrible war. When will it
end?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Tell me. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The woman who left that message for you
sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Crying? Why was she crying?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, uh. She didn’t say Mr. Duke. But since
I know you’re here with the Police Convention…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if
she ever calls again. We’re watching her very carefully… this woman has
been into laudanum. It’s a controlled experiment, but I suspect we’ll
need your cooperation before this thing is over.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, certainly… We’re always happy to
cooperate with the police…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t worry. You’re protected. Just treat this
poor woman like you’d treat any other human being in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What? Ah… yes, yes, I see what you mean… Yes…
so, you’ll be responsible then?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Of course. And now I have to get back to the
news. Send up some ice.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Good work. They’ll treat us like goddamn
lepers after that.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Lucy is looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: No, she’s looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: She really flipped over you. The only way I
could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert
for a showdown – that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her
all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn’t
for me, was it?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones
who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I don’t know for sure what they done to me,
but I remember it was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Twenty years… and Double Castration!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Wait! You can’t leave me alone in this snake
pit. This room is in my name.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: OK, goddamnit!… Look… I’ll call her. I’ll get
her off our backs. You’re right. She’s my problem.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: It’s gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Relax. Let me handle this. You’d make a
piss-poor lawyer. …Room 1600, please. As your attorney, I advise you not
to worry. Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving
kit.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You won’t need much. Just a little tiny
taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
Adrenochrome.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Adrenochrome…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it’s me. I got your
message…what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he’ll never
forget… what? No, not dead, but he won’t be bothering anybody for a
while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his
teeth out…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I remember thinking, “Jesus, what a terrible
thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.”</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: But here’s the problem. That bastard cashed a
bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference. They’ll be looking for
both of you. Yeah, I know, but you can’t judge a book by its cover,
Lucy. Some people are just basically rotten… Anyway, the last thing you
want to do is call this hotel again; they’ll trace the call and put you
straight behind bars… no, I’m moving to the Tropicana right away. I have
to go, they’ve got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
it’s all over now… OH MY GOD!</p>
<p><strong>they’re kicking the door down!</strong>: No! Get away from
me! I’m innocent! It was Duke! I swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: No, I don’t know where she is. You’ll never
catch Lucy! She’s gone! I swear, I don’t know where she is! DON’T PUT
THAT THING ON ME!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Well. That’s that. She’s probably stuffing
herself down the incinerator about now. That’s the last we should be
hearing from Lucy. Where’s the opium?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I remember slumping on the bed, his
performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had
snapped – that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible
enemies. But the room was quiet again.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Never mind, it’s absolutely pure.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus… what kind of monster client have you
picked up this time? There’s only one source for this stuff – the
adrenaline gland from a living human body!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I know, but the guy didn’t have any cash to
pay me. He’s one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood –
said it would take me higher than I’ve ever been in my life. I thought
he was kidding, so I told him I’d just as soon have an ounce or so of
pure adrenochrome – or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew
on.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I could already feel the stuff working on me –
the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine –
maybe I should take a swim, I thought…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yeah, they nailed this guy for child
molesting. He swore he didn’t do it. “Why should I fuck with children?”
he says. “They’re too small.” Christ, werewolf is entitled to legal
counsel. I didn’t dare turn the creep down. He might have picked up a
letter opener and gone after my pineal gland!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat
a big handful and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Some of what?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Extract of pineal!</p>
<p>****: Sure. That’s a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you
into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Man, your head would swell up like a
watermelon, you’d probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: … grow claws… bleeding warts.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: … then you’d notice about six huge hairy tits
swelling up on your back…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: you’d go blind… your body would turn to wax…
they’d have to put you in a wheelbarrow and…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Man I’ll try about anything; but I’d never
touch a pineal gland.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What
about the glands?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you,
didn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe you could just… shove me into the pool,
or something…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: If I put you in the pool right now, you’d
sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much. Jesus, look at your face,
you’re about to explode.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Don’t try and fight it, or you’ll get brain
bubbles. Strokes, aneurysms. You’ll just wither up and die.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Sacrifice… sacrifice… sacrifice…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play
that song – right now, at this moment?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: When I came to the general back alley ambiance
of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul. How long had I been
lying there? Hours? Days? Months? All these signs of violence. What had
happened?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There was evidence in this room of excessive
consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since
1544 AD.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But what kind of addict would need all these
coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds? Would the presence of junkies
account for all these uneaten french fries? These puddles of glazed
ketchup on the bureau? Maybe so, but then why all this booze? And these
crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard
yellow crust…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: These were not the hoof prints of your normal
god-fearing junkie. It was too savage, too aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Grim memories and bad flashbacks.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Something ugly had happened. I was sure of
it…</p>
<p><strong>smashed mirror he sees the fragmented reflection of
himself…</strong>: sleeping on the sofa.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Please… please… I’m only the maid. I didn’t
mean nothin!…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: bed, flashing his</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: She must have used a pass key. I was
polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I
took her.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What made you do it? Who paid you off?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Nobody. I’m the maid!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You’re lying! You were after the evidence.
Who put you up to this – the manager?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Bullshit! You’re just as much a part of it as
they are!</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Part of what?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The dope ring. You must know what’s going on
in this hotel. Why do you think we’re here?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I know you’re cops, but I thought you were
just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up
the room. I don’t know anything about dope!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Come on, baby don’t try to tell us you never
heard of the Grange Gorman.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that
stuff!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe she’s telling the truth. Maybe she’s not
part of it.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: No! I swear I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: In that case, maybe she can help.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Yes! I’ll help you all you need! I hate
dope!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: So do we, lady.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I think we should put her on the payroll. See
what she comes up with.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Do you think you can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: One phone call every day. Just tell us what
you’ve seen. Don’t worry if it doesn’t add up, that’s our problem.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: You’d pay me for that?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re damn right. But the first time you say
anything about this, to anybody – you’ll go straight to prison for the
rest of your life. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for
Alice.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Alright, Alice… you’ll be contacted by
Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He’ll be posing as a politician.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A
thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Oh Lord! I’d do just about anything for
that!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You and a lot of other people.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The password is: “One Hand Washes The Other.”
The minute you hear that, you say “I fear nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I fear nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Oh, and don’t bother to make up the room.
That way we won’t have to risk another of these little incidents, will
we?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can’t tell you
how sorry I am about what happened…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s all over now. Thank God for
the decent people.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo on tape</strong>: … Thank God for the decent
people.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Memories of that night are extremely hazy…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There is a definite obligation, when you boom
around Vegas in a white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a certain style.</p>
<p><strong>shopper #1</strong>: Hey! Is that your car?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Sure is.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Any of you folks want the milk? We’re after
the meat. This is honest coconut essence. Real meat.</p>
<p><strong>shopper #2</strong>: Meat, hell! Look what you’re doing to
that car!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Fuck the car. They should make these things
with a goddamn FM radio.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeh… This foreign made crap – is sucking our
dollar balance dry!</p>
<p><strong>shopper #3</strong>: Someone should stop them!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You poor fools don’t understand, do you? This
car is the property of the World Bank! That money goes to</p>
<p><strong>shopper #3</strong>: Somebody should call the police!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Police? Are you people crazy?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: You folks every heard of ole Patrick Henry?
Know what he said?!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!</p>
<p><strong>shopper #3</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>shopper #1</strong>: Call the goddamn police!</p>
<p><strong>shopper #4</strong>: Look what they’ve done to that beautiful
car!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This crowd is not rational. They can’t relate
to us. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You people voted for Hubert Humphrey! You
killed Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The crowd broke ranks. Nobody wants to be run
over by a Coupe de Ville.</p>
<p><strong>voice on tape</strong>: You found the American Dream? In this
town?</p>
<p><strong>duke on tape</strong>: We’re sitting on the main nerve right
now…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The manager told me a story about the owner of
this place…about how he always wanted to run away and join the circus
when he was a kid. Well, now the bastard has his own circus, and a
license to steal, too.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: You’re right – he’s the model.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Absolutely! Pure Horatio Alger… Say…</p>
<p><strong>duke on tape</strong>: … how much do you think he’d take for
the ape?</p>
<p><strong>voice on tape</strong>: Holy God!…</p>
<p><strong>rental agent</strong>: Holy God!, how did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They beat the shit out of it.</p>
<p><strong>rental agent</strong>: The top’s completely jammed!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, something’s wrong with the motor…</p>
<p><strong>duke on tape</strong>: … The generator light’s been on red
ever since I drove the thing into Lake Mead on a water test…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, no. Shit…</p>
<p><strong>duke on tape</strong>: Where’s the ape? I’m ready to write a
check.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Forget it, he just attacked an old man… he
took a bite out of the bartender’s head! The cops took the ape away.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Goddamnit! What’s the bail? I want that ape!
I’ve already reserved two first-class seats on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There was every reason to believe that we had
been heading for trouble, that we’d pushed our luck a bit far…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hey there! You folks want to buy some
heroin?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Hey, honkies! Goddamnit, I’m serious. I want
to sell you some pure fucking smack!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Cheap heroin! This is the real stuff! You
won’t get hooked. I just got back from Vietnam! This is scag, folks.
Pure scag!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Shoot! Fuck! Scag! Blood! Heroin! Rape!
Cheap! Communist! Jab it right in your fucking eyeballs!</p>
<p><strong>man in car</strong>: You dirty bastards! Pull over and I’ll
kill you! God damn you! You bastards!</p>
<p><strong>man in car on tape</strong>: You dirty bastards!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo on tape</strong>: Shit, he was trying to bite me! I
shoulda maced the fucker!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Back door beauty!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly
atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The possibility of physical and mental
collapse is very real… No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy
the ticket, take the ride…</p>
<p><strong>voice off</strong>: Shit! Faggot! Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: North Vegas is where you go when you’ve fucked
up once too often on The Strip and when you’re not even welcome in the
cut-rate Downtown places.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like a
fairly safe haven from our storms. No hassles, no talk. Just a place to
rest and regroup. I wasn’t even hungry.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There was nothing in the atmosphere of the
North Star to put me on my guard…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Two glasses of ice water with ice.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: She looked like a burnt out caricature of Jane
Russell. She was definitely in charge here…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He did it very casually, but I knew that our
peace was about to be shattered.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: A napkin.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Don’t give me that bullshit! I know what
it means! You goddamn fat pimp bastard.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: That’s the name of a horse I used to own.
What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You sonofabitch! I take a lot of shit in
this place, but I sure as hell don’t have to take it off a</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus. I thought, what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The question mark was emphasized.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Pay your bill and get the hell out! You
want me to call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Spic pimp?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I was stupid with shock – not knowing whether
to run or start laughing.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: How much is the lemon meringue pie?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain
was functioning on some basic motor survival level.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Thirty-five cents!</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: I mean the whole pie.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Let’s say five dollars. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The sight of the blade had triggered bad
memories. The glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut. She
was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Drive! Drive! Drive! We have fifteen fucking
minutes to get me on that plane!</p>
<p><strong>torn, slapping in the wind – roars through an
intersection</strong>: as the light turns red.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: What are you doing? You were supposed to turn
back there!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by –
burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only
chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we’d gone to such excess
that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could
possibility believe it.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Jesus Christ!!!</p>
<p><strong>the white whale tears down the deserted freeway.
gonzo</strong>: looks wildly around.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Goddamnit! We’re lost! What are we doing out
here on this godforsaken road?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: The airport is over there!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Never missed a plane yet.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll drop you right next to the plane.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: No! I can’t get out! They’ll crucify me. I’ll
have to take the blame!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to
the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this
town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there
so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You
ready?</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Why not? But for Christ’s sake, just do it
fast!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t take any guff from those swine.
Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the
Right People.</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Yeah… Explaining my Position. Some asshole
wrote a poem about that once…</p>
<p><strong>gonzo</strong>: Probably good advice, if you have shit for
brains.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There he goes – one of God’s own prototypes –
a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass
production. Too weird to live and too rare to die.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We are all wired into a survival trip now. No
more of the speed that fueled that 60’s. That was the fatal flaw in Tim
Leary’s trip. He crashed around America selling “consciousness
expansion” without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities
that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: All those pathetically eager acid freaks who
thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit.
But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him
was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped
create…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: … a generation of permanent cripples, failed
seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the
Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody… or at least some
force – is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There was only one road back to L.A. US
Interstate 15, just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow
and Berdoo, then on to the Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic
oblivion: safety, obscurity, just another freak in the Freak
Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ahhh. Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>wheels, wooden yokes. a stuffed horse hangs from
the</strong>: RAFTERS. The sunlight shafts through high windows. AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden bar. A NORMAN
ROCKWELL PAINTING… ONLY REAL.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: What’ll you have?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ballantine Ale…?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Hard to find it served like this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>american icons… a remington cowboy, a bugs bunny, a
tweety</strong>: PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER. The logo on the
rack reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Where ya comin’ from, young man?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had
good luck there. You’re the type.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I know. I’m a triple Scorpio.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: That’s a fine combination. You can’t
lose.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Oh, my God!…</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: This is my granddaughter…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t worry… … and I’m actually the District
Attorney from Ignoto County. Just another good American like
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My heart was filled with joy. I felt like a
monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger… a man on the move… and just sick
enough to be totally confident.</p>
