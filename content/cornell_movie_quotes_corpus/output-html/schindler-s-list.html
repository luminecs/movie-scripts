<p><strong>clerks</strong>: …Rossen… Lieberman… Wachsberg…</p>
<p><strong>clerks</strong>: …When your name is called go over there…
take this over to that table…</p>
<p><strong>clerks</strong>: …you�re in the wrong line, wait over there…
you, come over here…</p>
<p><strong>clerks</strong>: …Biberman… Steinberg… Chilowitz…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: From the gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Do I know him?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Find out who he is.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Let me get this one.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, put it away, put it away.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What are you drinking, gin?</p>
<p><strong>ss officer 1</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>ss officer 2</strong>: That’s Oskar Schindler. He’s an old
friend of… I don’t know, somebody’s.</p>
<p><strong>clerks</strong>: Groder… Gemeinerowa… Libeskind…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Stern?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Are you Itzhak Stern?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There’s a company you did the books for
on Lipowa Street, made what, pots and pans?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: By law, I have to tell you, sir, I’m a
Jew.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right, you’ve done it – good company,
you think?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: It did all right.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I don’t know anything about enamelware,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I was just the accountant.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Simple engineering, though, wouldn’t you
think? Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other
things, couldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Field kits, mess kits…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Army contracts.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Once the war ends, forget it, but for now
it’s great, you could make a fortune. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I think most people right now have other
priorities.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Get the contracts and I’m sure you’ll do very
well. In fact the worse things get the better you’ll do. It was a
“pleasure.”</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The contracts? That’s the easy part.
Finding the money to buy the company, that’s hard.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You know anybody?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Jews, yeah. Investors.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Jews can no longer own businesses, sir,
that’s why this one’s for sale.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, they wouldn’t own it, I’d own it.
I’d pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do
whatever they want, everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Pots and pans.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Something they can hold in their
hands.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I don’t know anybody who’d be interested in
that.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They should be.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: You don’t recognize it? Maybe that’s
because it’s not what I asked for.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: You asked for shoe polish.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it
to the Army. But by the time it got there – because of the cold – it
broke, the whole truckload.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: So I’m responsible for the weather?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: I asked for metal, you gave me
glass.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: This is not my problem.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Look it up.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: This is not your problem? Everybody
wants to know who I got it from, and I’m going to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Metal.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Let’s say this is what you give me.
These are fees I have to pay some guys. This is my commission. This is
what I bring you back in Occupation currency.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: That’s a nice shirt.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You don’t know where I could find a shirt
like that.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There’s nothing in the stores.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: You have any idea what a shirt like
this costs?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Nice things cost money.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I don’t know, ten or twelve. That’s a
good color. Dark blues, grays.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Write down your measurements.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m going to need some other things. As
things come up.</p>
<p><strong>czurda</strong>: The SS doesn’t own the trains, somebody’s
got to pay. Whether it’s a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn’t
matter – which, by the way, you have to see. You have to set aside an
afternoon, go down to the station and see this.</p>
<p><strong>czurda</strong>: So you got thousands of fares that have to
be paid. Since it’s the SS that’s reserved the trains, logically they
should pay. But this is a lot of money. The Jews. They’re the ones
riding the trains, they should pay. So you got Jews paying their own
fares to ride on cattle cars to God knows where. They pay the SS full
fare, the SS turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare,
and pockets the difference.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There’s nothing more sacred than
marriage. No happier an occasion than one’s wedding day. I wish you all
the best.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I go to the bank, I go in, they tell me my
account’s been placed in Trust. In Trust? What are they talking about,
whose Trust? The Germans’. I look around. Now I see that everybody’s
arguing, they can’t get to their money either.</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: This is true?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I’ll take you there.</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: Let me understand. The Nazis have
taken your money. So because they’ve done this to you, you expect me to
go unpaid. That’s what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: That makes sense to you?</p>
<p><strong>einsatz nco</strong>: I want you to spit on it. I want you to
walk past, spit on it, and stand over there.</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: I haven’t been to temple must be fifty
years. Nor have I been invited.</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: You don’t approve of the way I make my
living? I’m a bad man, I do bad things?</p>
<p><strong>max redlicht</strong>: I’ve done some things… but I won’t do
this.</p>
<p><strong>einsatz nco</strong>: What does this mean? Of all of you,
there’s only one who has the guts to say no? One? And he doesn’t even
believe? I come in here, I ask you to do something no one should ever
ask. And you do it? What won’t you do?</p>
<p><strong>einsatz nco</strong>: You, sir, I respect.</p>
<p><strong>einsatz nco</strong>: The rest of you… …are beneath his
contempt.</p>
<p><strong>polish girl</strong>: Goodbye, Jews.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Ghetto Police. I’m a policeman now, can
you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Yeah, I can.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: For each thousand you invest, you take
from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month – to begin
in July and to continue for one year – after which time, we’re even.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>investor 1</strong>: Not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Not good enough? Look where you’re
living. Look where you’ve been put. “Not good enough.” A couple of
months ago, you’d be right. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>investor 1</strong>: Money’s still money.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, it isn’t, that’s why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Did I call this meeting? You told
Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me. I’m here. Now you want to
negotiate? The offer’s withdrawn.</p>
<p><strong>investor 2</strong>: How do we know you’ll do what you
say?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Because I said I would. What do you want,
a contract? To be filed where? I said what I’ll do, that’s our
contract.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled labor
is seven Marks a day, five for unskilled and women. This is what you pay
the Economic Office, the laborers themselves receive nothing. Poles you
pay wages. Generally, they get a little more. Are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What was that about the SS, the rate,
the… ?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: The Jewish worker’s salary, you pay it
directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: But it’s less. It’s less than what I
would pay a Pole. That’s the point I’m trying to make. Poles cost
more.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Why should I hire Poles?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Not essential work, stand over there.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m a metal polisher.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: I’d never ask you for money, you know
that. I don’t even like talking about it – money, favors – I find it
very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, look. It’s the others. They’re the
ones causing these delays.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: What others?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Whoever. They’re the ones. They’d
appreciate some kind of gesture from me.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I should send it to you, though, don’t
you think? You can forward it on? I’d be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: That’d be fine.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Done. Let’s not talk about it anymore,
let’s have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: My father was fond of saying you need
three things in life. A good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever
accountant. The first two…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Just pretend for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>klonowska</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: She’s so embarrassed – look at her –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You know what, you’d like her.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Oskar, please –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What –</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: I don’t have to like her just because you
do. It doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You would, though. That’s what I’m
saying.</p>
<p><strong>klonowska</strong>: Goodbye. It was a pleasure meeting
you.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: You’ve done well here.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Careful of the pavement –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: – Mrs. Schindler.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Mrs. Schindler.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: It’s not a charade, all this?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: A charade? How could it be a charade?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There’s no way I could have known this
before, but there was always something missing. In every business I
tried, I see now it wasn’t me that was failing, it was this thing, this
missing thing. Even if I’d known what it was, there’s nothing I could
have done about it, because you can’t create this sort of thing. And it
makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Luck.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: War.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It
feels good.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Should I stay?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s a beautiful city.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Should I stay?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: No, it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Promise me no doorman or maitre ’d will
presume I am anyone other than Mrs. Schindler… and I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>clerks</strong>: Your luggage will follow you. Make sure it’s
clearly labeled. Leave your luggage on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Every other time it’s been all right. This
time when I weigh the truck, I see he’s heavy, he’s loaded too much. I
point this out to him, I tell him to wait, he tells me he’s got a new
arrangement with Mr. Schindler – – that you know all about it and it’s
okay with you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s “okay” with me?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: How heavy was he?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Not that much, just too much for it to be a
mistake – 200 kilos.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>woman at desk</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: If you or anyone acting as an agent for
you comes to my factory again, I’ll have you arrested.</p>
<p><strong>investor</strong>: It was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It was a mistake? What was a mistake? How
do you know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>investor</strong>: All right, it wasn’t a mistake, but it was
one time.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: We had a deal, you broke it. One phone
call and your whole family is dead.</p>
<p><strong>investor</strong>: I gave you money.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How you feeling, all right?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What’s the matter, everything all right
at home? Mila’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: She’s good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I could try to read this or I could eat
my lunch while it’s till hot. We’re doing well?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Better this month than last?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Any reason to think next month will be
worse?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: The war could end.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There’s a machinist outside who’d like to
thank you personally for giving him a job.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: He asks every day. It’ll just take a minute.
He’s very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Mr. Lowenstein?</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I want to thank you, sir, for giving me
the opportunity to work.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You’re welcome, I’m sure you’re doing a
great job.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: The SS beat me up. They would have
killed me, but I’m essential to the war effort, thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: I work hard for you. I’ll continue to
work hard for you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: That’s great, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: God bless you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: You’re a good man.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Okay, Mr. Lowenstein.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: He saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Yes, he did.</p>
<p><strong>lowenstein</strong>: God bless him.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Don’t ever do that to me again.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Close the door.</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: It’s got nothing to do with reality, Oskar,
I know it and you know it, it’s a matter of national priority to these
guys. It’s got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I lost a day of production. I lost a
worker. I expect to be compensated.</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: File a grievance with the Economic Office,
it’s your right.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Would it do any good?</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: I think you’re going to have to put up with
a lot of snow shoveling yet.</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: A one-armed machinist, Oskar?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He was a metal press operator, quite
skilled.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Unlike your radiators – and your boxes –
my products aren’t for sale on the open market. This company has only
one client, the German Army. And lately I’ve been having trouble
fulfilling my obligations to my client. With your help, I hope the
problem can be solved. The problem, simply, is space.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’d like you to consider a proposal which
I think you’ll find equitable. I’d like you to think about it and get
back to me as soon as –</p>
<p><strong>kuhnpast</strong>: Excuse me – do you really think this is
appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>kuhnpast</strong>: I can appreciate your problem. If I had
any space I could lease you, I would. I don’t. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hohne</strong>: Me neither, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I don’t want to lease your facilities, I
want to buy them. I’m prepared to offer you fair market value. And to
let you stay on, if you want, as supervisors. On salary.</p>
<p><strong>kuhnpast</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>kuhnpast</strong>: Thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You try to be fair to people, they walk
out the door; I’ve never understood that. What’s next?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Christmas presents.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Ah, yes.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: Oskar…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo</strong>: Oskar Schindler?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo</strong>: We have a warrant to take your company’s
business records with us. And another to take you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Am I permitted to have my secretary
cancel my appointments for the day?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo clerk</strong>: You live very well.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo clerk</strong>: This standard of living comes
entirely from legitimate sources, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo clerk</strong>: As an SS supplier, you have a moral
obligation to desist from blackmarket dealings. You’re in business to
support the war effort, not to fatten –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You know? When my friends ask, I’d love
to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and
respect.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Chances of getting a bottle of vodka
pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>waffen guard</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you, sir. Whenever
you’re ready, you’re free to leave.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo clerk</strong>: I’d advise you not to get too
comfortable. Sooner or later, law prevails. No matter who your friends
are.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You expect me to walk home, or what?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo clerk</strong>: Bring a car around for
Mr. Schindler.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: If you’d return the ledgers to my office
I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Excuse me – hey – They’re working.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He’s essential. Without him, everything
comes to a grinding halt. If that happens –</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Itzhak Stern? He’s on the list.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, let’s find him.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: He’s on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list. He’s on the list. You can’t have
him.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m talking to a clerk.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sir, the list is correct.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I didn’t ask you about the list, I asked
you your name.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Klaus Tauber.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The gentleman thinks a mistake’s been
made.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: My plant manager is somewhere on this
train. If it leaves with him on it, it’ll disrupt production and the
Armaments Board will want to know why.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Is he on the list?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: The list is correct, sir. There’s nothing
I can do.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: May as well get your name while you’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: My name? My name is Kunder. Sergeant
Kunder. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Schindler.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very
much. I think I can guarantee you you’ll both be in Southern Russia
before the end of the month. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>clerk &amp; sergeant</strong>: Stern! Itzhak Stern!</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Initial it, please. And this…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It makes no difference to us, you understand
– this one, that one. It’s the inconvenience to the list. It’s the
paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I somehow left my work card at home. I tried
to tell them it was a mistake, but they –</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I’m sorry. It was stupid. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Make a nice driveway.</p>
<p><strong>knude</strong>: This street divides the ghetto just about in
half. On the right – Ghetto</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: civil employees, industry workers, so on. On the
left, Ghetto B: surplus labor, the elderly mostly. Which is where you’ll
probably want to start.</p>
<p><strong>knude</strong>: Of course that’s entirely up to you.</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: She says the foundation was poured wrong,
she’s got to take it down. I told her it’s a barracks, not a fucking
hotel, fucking Jew engineer.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: The entire foundation has to be dug up and
re-poured. If it isn’t, the thing will collapse before it’s even
completed.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You argued with my man. Shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I’m sure you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: That’s somebody who knew what they were
doing. That’s somebody I needed. Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it,
like she said.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Today is history. The young will ask with
wonder about this day. Today is history and you are a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: When, elsewhere, they were footing the blame
for the Black Death, Kazimierz the Great, so called, told the Jews they
could come to Cracow. They came.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: They trundled their belongings into this
city, they settled, they took hold, they prospered.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: For six centuries, there has been a Jewish
Cracow.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: By this weekend, those six centuries, they’re
a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.</p>
<p><strong>majola</strong>: Amon… Christ…</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: Your machinery will be moved and installed by
the SS at no cost to you. You will pay no rent, no maintenance –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, no, come on, sit –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: We started without you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I miss anything important?</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: I was explaining to Mr. Bosch and
Mr. Madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into
Plaszow.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Oh, good, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: Since your labor is housed on-site, it’s
available to you at all times. You can work them all night if you want.
Your factory policies, whatever they’ve been in the past, they’ll
continue to be, they’ll be respected –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You know, they told me you were going to be
trouble – Czurda and Scherner.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: He looks great, though, doesn’t he? I have to
know – where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? It’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’d say I’d get you one but the guy who
made it, he’s probably dead, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Something wonderful’s happened, do you know
what it is? Without planning it, we’ve reached that happy point in our
careers where duty and financial opportunity meet.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I go to work the other day, there’s
nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to
go in, everybody’s gone –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: They’re not gone, they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They’re mine!</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Every day that goes by, I’m losing money.
Every worker that is shot, costs me money – I have to get somebody else,
I have to train them –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: We’re going to be making so much money, none
of this is going to matter –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s bad business.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Some of the boys went crazy, what’re you
going to do? You’re right, it’s bad business, but it’s over with, it’s
done. Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that’s
good business.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Scherner told me something else about
you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: That you know the meaning of the word
gratitude. That it’s not some vague thing with you like with some
guys.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You want to stay where you are. You got
things going on the side, things are good, you don’t want anybody
telling you what to do – I can understand all that. What you want is
your own sub-camp.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Do you have any idea what’s involved? The
paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking
permits, that’s enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up.
They stand around and they argue about drainage – I’m telling you,
you’ll want to shoot somebody, I’ve been through it, I know.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, you’ve been through it. You know.
You could make things easier for me.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’d be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>ss officer</strong>: You have the Poles beat the Czechs, you
have the Czechs beat the Poles, that way everybody stays in line.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All I have is Jews.</p>
<p><strong>leo john</strong>: – she’s seventy years old, she’s been
there forever – they bomb her house. Everything’s gone. The furniture,
everything.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Thank God she wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>leo john</strong>: I was thinking maybe you could help her
out. Some plates and mugs, some stew pots, I don’t know. Say half a
gross of everything?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: She run an orphanage, your aunt?</p>
<p><strong>leo john</strong>: She’s old. What she can’t use maybe she
can sell.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You want it sent directly to her or
through you?</p>
<p><strong>leo john</strong>: Through me, I think. I’d like to enclose a
card.</p>
<p><strong>leo john</strong>: Your wife must be a saint.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: She is.</p>
<p><strong>goeth’s girl</strong>: You’re not a soldier?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, dear.</p>
<p><strong>czurda</strong>: There’s a picture. Private Schindler?
Blanket around his shoulders over in Kharkov?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Happened to what’s his name – up in Warsaw –
and he was bigger than you, Oskar.</p>
<p><strong>czurda</strong>: Toebbens.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Happened to Toebbens. Almost. Himmler goes up
to Warsaw, tells the armament guys, “Get the fucking Jews out of
Toebbens’ factory and put Toebbens in the army,” and – “and sent him to
the Front.” I mean, the Front.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: It’s true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we
all love you too much.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I pay you too much.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You held back Stern. You held back the
one man most important to my business.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: He’s important to my business.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What do you want for him, I’ll give it to
you.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I want him. Come on, let’s go inside, let’s
have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: This, I don’t know, maybe you can trade
it for something.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I got to go, I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Oskar –</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There’s a guy. This thing happened. Goeth
came into the metalworks –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: What are you making?</p>
<p><strong>levartov</strong>: Hinges, sir.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I got some workers coming in tomorrow… Where
the hell they from again?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Yugoslavia.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Yugoslavia. I got to make room.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Make me a hinge.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Another.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: That’s very good. What I don’t understand,
though, is – you’ve been working since what, about six this morning? Yet
such a small pile of hinges?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Christ –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: God damn it –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The guy can turn out a hinge in less than
a minute? Why the long story?</p>
<p><strong>levartov</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Oh, yeah. You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Nobody knows who stole the chicken. A man
walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Still nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: It was you? You committed this crime?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You know who, though.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Him!</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah, sure, bring him over.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Thank –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He won’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Miss Krause.</p>
<p><strong>miss krause</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Pernod? Cognac?</p>
<p><strong>miss krause</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>miss krause</strong>: They say that no one dies here. They
say your factory is a haven. They say you are good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Who says that?</p>
<p><strong>miss krause</strong>: Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>miss krause</strong>: My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa
Krause. I’ve been living in Cracow on false papers since the ghetto
massacre. My parents are in Plaszow. They’re old. They’re killing old
people in Plaszow now. They bury them up in the forest. I have no money.
I borrowed these clothes. Will you bring them here?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I don’t do that. You’ve been misled. I
ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills. That’s what I
ask and that’s what I care about, get out of my office.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Cry and I’ll have you arrested, I swear
to God.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: People die, it’s a fact of life.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He wants to kill everybody? Great. What
am I supposed to do, bring everybody over? Is that what you think? Yeah,
send them over to Schindler, send them all. His place is a “haven,”
didn’t you know? It’s not a factory, it’s not an enterprise of any kind,
it’s a haven for people with no skills whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You think I don’t know what you’re doing?
You’re so quiet all the time? I know.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Are you losing money?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, I’m not losing money, that’s not the
point.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: What other point is –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s dangerous. It’s dangerous, to me,
personally.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You have to understand, Goeth’s under
enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He’s got
this whole place to run, he’s responsible for everything that goes on
here, all these people – he’s got a lot of things to worry about. And
he’s got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good,
always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn’t
be like this. He’d be all right. There’d be just the good aspects of
him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine,
the ladies, making money…</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: And killing.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ll admit it’s a weakness. I don’t think
he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect
me to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There’s nothing you can do. I’m not asking
you to do anything. You came into my office.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Perlman, husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Give it to Goldberg, have him send them
over.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They don’t fear us because we have the
power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill
arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him
killed, we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we
feel even better. That’s not power, though, that’s justice. That’s
different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill
– and we don’t. That’s power. That’s what the emperors had. A man stole
something, he’s brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on
the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he’s going to die… and the
emperor pardons him. This worthless man. He lets him go. That’s power.
That’s power.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Amon the Good.</p>
<p><strong>stable boy</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, I’m almost done.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Oh, that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: I have to report, sir, I’ve been unable to
remove the stains from your bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: What are you using?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Soap, sir.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Soap? Not lye?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon you.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: If he didn’t steal so much, I could hide it.
If he’s steal with some discretion…</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There are fifteen thousand people here –</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Goeth says there’s twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There are fifteen. He wants to say sixteen,
seventeen, all right, maybe he can get away with it, but ten thousand
over? It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Stern, do me a favor, get out of here. You
want to argue about it, go tell Goeth.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: The SS auditors keep coming around, looking
over the books – Goeth knows this –</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: – you’d think he’d have the common sense to
see what’s coming. No, he steals with complete impunity.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: So you’ll be rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: If Plaszow is closed, they’ll have to send us
somewhere else. Where – who knows? Gross-Rosen maybe. Maybe
Auschwitz.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I think it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, I’ll talk to somebody. I’ll take
care of it.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What’s he done that’s so bad – take
money? That’s a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?
We’re here to make money, all of us.</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: There’s taking money and there’s taking
money, you know that. He’s taking money.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: The place produces nothing. I shouldn’t
say that – nothing it produces reaches the Army. That’s not all
right.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: So I’ll talk to him about it.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: He’s a friend of yours, you want to help
him out. Tell me this, though – has he ever once shown you his
appreciation? I’ve yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you
note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He’s got no style, we all know that. So,
we should hang him for it?</p>
<p><strong>toffel</strong>: He’s stealing from you, Oskar.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Of course he’s stealing from me, we’re in
business together. What is this? I’m sitting here, suddenly everybody’s
talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take
from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody’s
happy.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: Not like him.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn’t
matter the amount we steal, it’s that we do it. Each of us sitting at
this table.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: He doesn’t deserve your loyalty. More
important, he’s not worth you making threats against us.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a
simple fact.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Come on, let’s watch the girls.</p>
<p><strong>factory girl</strong>: …On behalf of the workers… sir… I wish
you a happy birthday…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Thank them for me.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Commandant, sir.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: My mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: What about my wife?</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: This is our place.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I tried to call you, I’m running a little
late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I
got to make room for them. It’s always something.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: They’re complaining now? They don’t know what
complaining is.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What do you say we get your fire brigade
out here and hose down the cars?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Bring the fire trucks!</p>
<p><strong>hujar</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: This is really cruel, Oskar, you’re giving
them hope. You shouldn’t do that, that’s cruel.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ve got some 200-meter hoses back at
D.E.F., we can reach the cars down at the end.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Hujar!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What does he think he’s saving them from?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m not saying you’ll regret it, but you
might. I want you to be aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo 1</strong>: We’ll risk it.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right, sure, it’s a nice day, I’ll go
for a drive with you guys.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I violated the Race and Resettlement Act.
Though I doubt they can point out the actual provision to me. I kissed a
Jewish girl.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: He likes women. He likes good-looking women.
He sees a good-looking woman, he doesn’t think. This guy has so many
women. They love him. He’s married, he’s got all these women. All right,
she was Jewish, he shouldn’t have done it. But you didn’t see this girl.
I saw this girl. This girl was very good-looking.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews.
You work closely with them like I do, you see this. They have this
power, it’s like a virus. Some of my men are infected with this virus.
They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment,
because this is as real as typhus. I see this all the time.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: It’s a matter of money? We can discuss that.
That’d be all right with me.</p>
<p><strong>ss colonel</strong>: You’re offering me a bribe?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: A “bribe?” No, no, please come on… a
gratuity.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: Hello, Amon.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>ss officer</strong>: I want to hear “Gloomy Sunday”
again.</p>
<p><strong>scherner</strong>: We give you Jewish girls at five marks a
day, Oskar, you should kiss us, not them.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: God forbid you ever get a real taste for
Jewish skirt. There’s no future in it. No future. They don’t have a
future. And that’s not just good old- fashioned Jew-hating talk. It’s
policy now.</p>
<p><strong>ss officer</strong>: “Gloomy Sunday” again.</p>
<p><strong>treblinka guy</strong>: – We can process at Treblinka, if
everything is working? I don’t know, maybe two thousand units a day.</p>
<p><strong>treblinka guy</strong>: Now Auschwitz. Now you’re talking.
What I got is nothing, it’s like a… a machine. Auschwitz, though, now
there’s a death factory. There, they know how to do it. There, they know
what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Enough – Jesus – God –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Can you believe this?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I’m trying to live my life, they come up with
this? I got to find every body buried up here? And burn it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You took my workers.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: They’re taking mine. When I said they didn’t
have a future I didn’t mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: I don’t know. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: This is good. I’m out of business and he’s
catching tadpoles with his son.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brinnlitz guy 1</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Let me buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>brinnlitz guy 2</strong>: Oskar - my friend Lena.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How do you do? What can I get you,
what’re you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>brinnlitz guy 2</strong>: Nothing’s changed. Then again,
something has changed, hasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Things worked out. I made some money over
there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.</p>
<p><strong>brinnlitz guy 2</strong>: Now you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Now I’m back, and you know what I’m going
to do now? I’m going to have a good time. So are you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>brinnlitz guy 2</strong>: He’s a salesman.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You want these people.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: These people, my people, I want my
people.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: What are you, Moses? What is this? Where’s
the money in this? What’s the scam?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s good business.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Oh, this is “good business” in your opinion.
You’ve got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia –
it doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Look –</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You’re not telling me something.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s good for me – I know them, I’m
familiar with them. It’s good for you – you’ll be compensated. It’s good
for the Army. You know what I’m going to make?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need
that. Everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You’re probably scamming me somehow. If I’m
making a hundred, you got to be making three.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: If you admit to making three, then it’s four,
actually. But how?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I just told you.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: You did, but you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Yeah, all right, don’t tell me, I’ll go along
with it, it’s just irritating to me I can’t figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All you have to do is tell me what it’s
worth to you. What’s a person worth to you.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: What’s one worth to you? That’s the
question.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Poldek Pfefferberg… Mila Pfefferberg…</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: A virus…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You can do the same thing I’m doing.
There’s nothing stopping you.</p>
<p><strong>madritsch</strong>: I’ve done enough for the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The investors.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All of them. Szerwitz, his family.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Four hundred, four fifty –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: About six hundred –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Eight hundred, give or take.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Give or take what, Stern – how many –
count them.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You can finish that page.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: What did Goeth say? You just told him how
many you needed?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m buying them. I’m paying him. I give
him money, he gives me the people. If you were still working for me I’d
expect you to talk me out of it, it’s costing me a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Give him the list, he’ll sign it, he’ll
get the people ready. I have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of
things on that end, I’ll see you there.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Finish the page.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: This is my home.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I was born here, my wife was born here,
my mother is buried here, this is my home.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Do you really think I’d bring a thousand
Jewish criminals into my home?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: These are skilled munitions workers –
they are essential to the war effort –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: – It is my duty to supervise them – and
it is your duty to allow me –</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Am I on the list?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: What list is that?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: The good list? Well, that depends, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Hey, Poldek, how’s it going? You know
about the list? You’re on it.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Of course I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: You want to stay on it? What do you got
for me?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: What do I got for you?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Takes diamonds to stay on this list.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: I’ll kill you, that’s what I got for
you.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You’ll be interested to know I received a
cable this morning from the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The women have
left. They should be arriving here sometime tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Where are the clerks?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They’re in Auschwitz.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo</strong>: Your friend Amon Goeth has been
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo</strong>: There are some things that are unclear. We
need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’d love to, it’ll have to wait until I
get back. I have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right, okay, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo</strong>: In Breslau.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Breslau? I can’t go to Breslau. Not
now.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: How old are you, Mother?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sir, a mistake’s been made. We’re not
supposed to be here, we work for Oskar Schindler. We’re Schindler
Jews.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: And who on earth is Oskar
Schindler?</p>
<p><strong>plaszow guard</strong>: He had a factory in Cracow.
Enamelware.</p>
<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: A potmaker?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Everything you say will be held in
confidence. You are not under investigation. You are not under
investigation. Mr. Goeth is. He is being held on charges of embezzlement
and racketeering. You’re here at his request to corroborate his denials.
Our information onto his financial speculations comes from many sources.
On his behalf there is only you. We know you are close friends. We know
this is hard for you. But we must ask you –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: He stole our country blind.</p>
<p><strong>mila</strong>: Where’s Schindler now?</p>
<p><strong>hoss</strong>: You’re right, a clerical error has bee made.
Let me offer you this in apology for the inconvenience. I have a
shipment coming in tomorrow, I’ll cut you three hundred from it. New
ones. These are fresh.</p>
<p><strong>hoss</strong>: The train comes, we turn it around, it’s
yours.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I appreciate it. I want these.</p>
<p><strong>hoss</strong>: You shouldn’t get stuck on names.</p>
<p><strong>hoss</strong>: That’s right, it creates a lot of
paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: These are mine. They’re on the list.
These are my workers. They should be on the train.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They’re skilled munition workers. They’re
essential.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: They’re boys.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Their fingers. They polish the insides of
shell casings. How else do you expect me to polish the inside of a 45
millimeter shell casing?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Under Department W provisions, it is
unlawful to kill a worker without just cause. Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths.
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and I get paid, that’s
how it works. So there will be no summary executions here. There will be
no interference of any kind with production. In hopes of ensuring that,
guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my
authorization.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: For your cooperation, you have my
gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Good. It’s taken a while to calibrate the
machines, but it’s going good now.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: This isn’t right, is it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: There. That looks right.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How’s it going, Rabbi?</p>
<p><strong>levartov</strong>: Good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Sun’s going down.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It is Friday, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>levartov</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You should be preparing for the Sabbath,
shouldn’t you? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ve got some wine in my office. Why
don’t we go over there, I’ll give it to you. Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I want you to come work for me.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You don’t have to live with me, I
wouldn’t ask that. It’s a nice place. You’d like it. It looks awful. You
get used to that.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right – We can spend time together
that way. We can see each other, see how it goes – without the strain of
– whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out
to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know. This way we’ll see
each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler. My
wife.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Stern is my accountant and friend.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Emilie’s offered to work in the clinic.
To… work there.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: That’s very generous of you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: It was a pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: Pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Can you fix it? The radio.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: What’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: How should I know? It’s broken. See what
you can do.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Stern.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: They arrived.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They arrived, can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: We’ve received a complaint from the Armaments
Board. A very angry complaint. The artillery shells, the tank shells,
rocket casings – apparently all of them – have failed quality-control
tests.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, that’s to be expected. They have to
understand. These are start- up problems. This isn’t pots and pans, this
is a precise business. I’ll write them a letter.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: They’re withholding payment.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I
wouldn’t worry about it. We’ll get it right one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There’s a rumor you’ve been going around
miscalibrating the machines. I don’t think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: They could close us down.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: All right. Call around, find out where we
can buy shells and buy them. We’ll pass them off as ours.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I know what you’re saying, but I don’t see
the difference.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You don’t? I do. I see a difference.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: You’ll lose money. That’s one difference.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Fewer shells will be made.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Stern, if this factory ever produces a
shell that can actually be fired… I’ll be very unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>liepold</strong>: Department W does not forbid my presence on
the factory floor. That is a lie.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Shoot him. Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Shoot him without a hearing. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>liepold</strong>: He sabotaged the machine.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The machine’s broken?</p>
<p><strong>liepold</strong>: The prisoner is under the jurisdiction of
Section D. I’ll preside over the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: But the machine.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The machine is under the authorization of
the Armaments Inspectorate. I will preside over the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>janek</strong>: I’m unfamiliar with the Hilo machines. I
don’t know why I was assigned there.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: If you’re not skilled at armaments work,
you shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>janek</strong>: I’m a lathe operator.</p>
<p><strong>janek</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>janek</strong>: I did adjust the pressure controls.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>janek</strong>: I know that much about them. Somebody had set
the pressure controls wrong. I had to adjust –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The stupidity of these people. I wish
they were capable of sabotaging a machine.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Get him out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Isn’t this nice.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: Oskar, good of you to come.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Are you kidding, I never miss a party.
Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: You have a lovely home. It is nice. Big.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: Oh, God, you don’t have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Wine?</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: Your husband’s a very generous man.</p>
<p><strong>emilie</strong>: He’s always been.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I need guns.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: One of these days the Russians are going
to show up unannounced at my gate. I’d like the chance to defend myself.
I’d like my wife to have that chance. My civilian engineers. My
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: We’re losing the war, aren’t we.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It kind of looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>rasch</strong>: Pistols?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Pistols, rifles, carbines … I’d be
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Stern.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I’ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No, no, what, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Do you have any money I don’t know about?
Hidden away someplace?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Why, am I broke?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Poldek.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s been suggested I cremate them in my
furnaces. As a Catholic I will not. As a human being I will not.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: There’s an area beyond the church reserved
for the burial of suicides. Maybe I can convince the parish council to
allow them to be buried there.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: These aren’t suicides.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: These are victims of a great murder.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Probably looking for a handout.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>goeth</strong>: Where are the guards?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The guards aren’t allowed on the factory
floor. They make my workers nervous.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ll discipline him later.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: It’s time the guards came into the
factory.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: The unconditional surrender of Germany
has just been announced. At midnight tonight the war is over.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Tomorrow, you’ll begin the process of
looking for survivors of your families. In many cases you won’t find
them. After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned
throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: We’ve survived. Some of you have come up
to me and thanked me. Thank yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern, and
others among you, who, worrying about you, have faced death every
moment. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: You’ve shown extraordinary discipline.
You’ve behaved humanely here. You should be proud.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m a member of the Nazi party. I’m a
munitions manufacturer. I’m a profiteer of slave labor, I’m a criminal.
At midnight, you will be free and I will be hunted. I’ll remain with you
until five minutes after midnight After which time, and I hope you’ll
forgive me, I have to flee.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: In memory of the countless victims among
your people, I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I know you’ve received orders from our
Commandant – which he has received from his superiors – to dispose of
the population of this camp.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Now would be the time to do it. They’re
all here. This is your opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Or… …you could leave. And return to your
families as men instead of murderers.</p>
<p><strong>levartov</strong>: We’ve written a letter trying to explain
things. In case you’re captured. Every worker has signed it.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: It’s Hebrew. It says, ‘Whoever saves one
life, saves the world.’</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I could’ve got more out…</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I could’ve got more… if I’d just… I don’t
know, if I’d just… I could’ve got more…</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who
are alive because of you. Look at them.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: If I’d made more money… I threw away so
much money, you have no idea. If I’d just…</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: There will be generations because of what you
did.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I didn’t do enough.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: You did so much.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: This car. Goeth would’ve bought this car.
Why did I keep the car? Ten people, right there, ten more I could’ve
got. This pin –</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Two people. This is gold. Two more
people. He would’ve given me two for it. At least one. He would’ve given
me one. One more. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. One more.
I could’ve gotten one more person I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: They killed so many people… They killed
so many people…</p>
<p><strong>partisan</strong>: It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>partisan</strong>: So what are you doing? You’re free to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: When the Russians arrive. Until then
we’re staying here.</p>
<p><strong>ss nco</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>nco in charge</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: You have been liberated by the Soviet
Army.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Have you been in Poland?</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: I just came from Poland.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Are there any Jews left?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Where should we go?</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: I don’t know. Don’t go east, that’s for
sure, they hate you there. I wouldn’t go west either if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: We could use some food.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: Isn’t that a town over there?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: Good. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Things are great, things are great.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’m having a drink, come on in, we’ll
have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: I mean where have you been? Nobody’s
seen you around for a while.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: I’ve been here. I guess I haven’t been
out.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg</strong>: I thought maybe you’d like to come
over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.</p>
<p><strong>schindler</strong>: Yeah? Yeah, that’d be nice, let me get my
coat.</p>
<p><strong>schindler’s voice</strong>: Mila’s good?</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg’s voice</strong>: She’s good.</p>
<p><strong>schindler’s voice</strong>: Kids are good? Let’s stop at a
store on the way so I can buy them something.</p>
<p><strong>pfefferberg’s voice</strong>: They don’t need anything. They
just want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>schindler’s voice</strong>: Yeah, I know. I’d like to pick up
something for them. It’ll only take a minute.</p>
