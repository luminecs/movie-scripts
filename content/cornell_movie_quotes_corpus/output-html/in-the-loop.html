<p><strong>civil servant</strong>: Monitoring. All the usual.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How did your team do at the weekend?</p>
<p><strong>civil servant</strong>: Yeah, alright. We won.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Great. Wanker.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sam. Morning.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, pop pickers….what Shall we start with
today? Wonky Ron….or Simon Foster, on the PM programme for the BBC.</p>
<p><strong>eddie mair</strong>: Well, I’m joined by Simon Foster, the
Minister for International development. Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie mair</strong>: You’ve been in the job now for eighteen
months, do you think you’re making headway?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ah. Yes I do. You’d expect me to say that I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Mark, are you co-ordinating that millenium
goals press release?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well co-ordinate it better.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Yes, can do.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is that the Minister? Bloody nail - has anyone
got a nail file?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Have we heard anything from Malcolm about
last night’s interview?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No not yet.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Perhaps he didn’t hear it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Or maybe he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He might be dead. He might have had that
massive stroke we’ve all been waiting for. It’s in the post.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: …preventable sickness in many of the poorest
countries round the world….and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which
is a major, major issue….</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister for
International Development. He should be talking about food parcels, not
fucking arse-spraying mayhem.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And so if we can tackle the easy things, like
diarrhoea, then we can…..</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is
this, The Shitting Forecast?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: …and then hopefully that will strike another
blow in the war against preventable diseases.</p>
<p><strong>eddie mair</strong>: You mentioned the word `war”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Steady Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Against preventable diseases, yes….</p>
<p><strong>eddie mair</strong>: Yes. All the evidence now points to a US
military intervention in the Middle East. Is that you view?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well….personally, I think that war is
unforseeable.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sam! Sam!</p>
<p><strong>eddie mair</strong>: Unforseeable?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: NO YOU DO NOT THINK THAT! Sam! I’m going to
have to go over to International Development, and pull Simon Foster’s
fucking hair.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: He did not say “unforseeable’. You may have
heard him say it, but he did not say that, and that is a fact.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He’ll want you to row back from the
`unforeseeable’ thing on Question Time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: On Question Time, you know the funny question
they always ask at the end?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I think we should prep that now. I’d like to
shine on the funny question, cos I’m a funny guy. With a light
touch.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: There’s this guy, he’s a property tycoon. He’s
bought a South Sea Island. It might be something like that, you know.
“If you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island, who would
it be with?”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ah. Well, I can’t say my wife, because I
haven’t got one, and I can’t say my girlfriend, because I haven’t got
one of those either.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And don’t say Mandela, that’s…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Boring. And a bloke.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Or Keira Knightley.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Pervert. Sex. Minister.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: People don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Did you take the washing out of the
machine?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What do you mean, no?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No. I didn’t take the washing out of the
machine.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: It’s going to go really stale.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: It’s not fine. By the time…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It is fine. I’ll wear stale pants.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: I don’t want to go out with some who wears
stale pants.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, there we go. I could go commando, but I
don’t think that’s acceptable in government.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Please. So: got everything you need for your
first day in International Development?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh Yes. It’s all here. My massive intellect.
And an apple for Simon Foster.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Simon Fluster.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Don’t say that, I’m rebranding him.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Well he was crap on the radio last night. He
sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well I’m going to sort that out. After a week
I’ll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Have a good day, good luck honey.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Have a good day at the Foreign Office. Try not
to annoy Russia.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: I’ll give you a call later. Keep your phone
on. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, alright.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Oh and be careful - cars!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Are you going to keep ringing me up every two
minutes, because you’re starting to remind me of my mum. And that could
lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: I’m just checking whether you put last night’s
lasagne in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Croissants!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No. You’re fine to go ahead and print that.
It’s lies, you’d be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable.
No he did not. Oh, just before you go – when I tell your wife about you
and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference…would email be better? Or
a phone call? Or, hey I know, I’ll write it on a cake, “Your hack
husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the
new baby” in those little silver balls. Yeah, maybe best to spike it?
Okay. Fuckity-bye!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, it’s fine, it’s in the fridge. I put some
clingfilm over it.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Why did you put clingfilm on it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: To keep it fresh.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: It’s in the fridge, that’ll keep it fresh.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, but it still might dry out.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James
Lewis at the PM Programme please?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Still slightly warm. That’s how I like my
women as well.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No it isn’t. That’s a myth. Clingfilm is
perfectly safe.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, I’ll hold,. what’s he waiting for? A
sex-change?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: They wouldn’t sell clingfilm if it gave you
cancer. Clingfilm doesn’t give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn’t give you
syphillis.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: James! Right –Simon Foster? Yeah, very
funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom
tomorrow, OK? No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I’ll come over a lock you in
a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME
FUCKING BRIAN!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Paris Hilton?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Lily Allen.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. No women.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The Olson twins?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi. Right. I see.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Malcolm’s coming to see you.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Shit. He’s still alive. When’s he due?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Now. And don’t say you weren’t prepared
because I rang ahead. Give us a minute, will you love?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: In the words of the late, great Nat King
Fucking Cole, `Unforeseeable, that’s what you are..’</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So you’re…whatever your name is, Dan, the new
advisor? Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Toby.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Right. Just most of you lot tend to be called
Dan, or Danny, so it’s always worth a punt. OK, hello. As you know, I’m
Judy Molloy, Civil Service Director of Communications for International
Development.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Is this a normal morning, or…?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay, I’ve got a meeting in two minutes. And
the minister was rubbish in last night’s interview.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Rubbish?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s a technical term. It means he went on the
radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in
a washing machine.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh why didn’t you say? I mean, he asked
you. Fuck. Of course, that explains it. Yeah. Say, if he’d asked you to
fucking black up, or give him your PIN number, or shot yourself, would
you have done that as well.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I would have blacked up. It was the radio and
no-one would have known.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But war is – basically unforeseeable isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That is not our line, alright? Walk the
fucking line. Look.</p>
<p>****: Page 10</p>
<p><strong>mal colm</strong>: We’ve got Karen Clark over from
Washington, okay? We’ve got the US National Security Advisor’s main guy
coming. Yeah? We’ve got enough Pentagon goons here for a fucking coup
d’etat. This is not the time to send out a signal like this in some
personal fucking sodcast.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Minister, this is Toby.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Not the time love. Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an
odd morning, but ’Welcome to the madhouse!’I apologise for Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t apologise for me. You should
apologise for yourself. Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet
you’re still here?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell you
to fuck off what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Fuck off?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’ll go far.Now fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We were thinking, weren’t we Judy, that I
could row back on Question Time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, You’re not going on Question Time
tonight. You’ve been disinvited.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why? We’ve been prepping Question Time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Because they ask fucking questions on
Question Time. And you’re no good at questions. If it was Fumbling, Off-
Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you’d be our main guy. But it’s
not.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sorry, why wasn’t I told about this?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Why should I tell you about this?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Because it’s a scheduled media appearance by
this department’s Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my
purview…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your purview? Where do you think you are
sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government
department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty
little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a
lubricated horse cock.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Malcolm, your swearing doesn’t impress me. My
husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you
sound like Angela Lansbury.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: She’s married? The poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But…okay, Judy’s lubricated horse cock aside
for one moment…. Are you saying that I’m now not allowed to make any
media appearances?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, not until we can trust you to keep to
the line.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But I was going to keep to the line: “I don’t
actually think war is unforeseeable.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What is it then?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is it…I don’t know? Foreseeable? No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No. Not foreseeable. That’s fucking
declaring war. Do you want to fucking declare war?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m a cabinet minister. I didn’t get here by
screwing up every media appearance I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Write this down. It’s neither forseeable
nor undorseeable.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Right. So not inevitable, but
not…evitable.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, you need to work on this fucking
line. That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on. Oh, and
put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister
with a war question we’ll drop a bomb on them.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t do that. That’s political, that’s not
in my…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen,
darling, why don’t you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and
play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. Let them eat cock!
You, Ron Weasley – you do it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You needn’t worry about the Canadians.
They’re just happy to be there. Yes, well, they always look surprised
when they’re invited.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Listen, shall I just give Toby a quick call
about the Simon Foster thing?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hiya. You do know this is the third time
you’ve rung? Are you on a new tariff?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: So? How’s it going? You found the bogs
yet?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: All a bit manic. It was never like this at
Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from
farmers. They swear about everything.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Can you turn that down a bit? Look, I’ve got a
leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with
Karen Clark?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right - Karen Clark from…is that the woman who
went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Karen Clark, US Assistant Secretary of
State?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh right. Shit. Karen Clark. Wow. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Hang on, Michael wants to say something.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Meat! Simon’s only going to be meat in the
room. Don’t get his hopes up.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Yeah, so you know – Simon, between us, he’s
just going to be meat in the room.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Meat?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Yeah. The Americans don’t feel they’re getting
a real meeting unless there’s thirty of you on each side. So Simon
is…you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical
goods? Sort of one of those. But you might not want to tell him that. I
ought to go. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Likewise. Affirmative on that.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So, quick tour.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Um, I do just need to…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Over there…that’s Mike’s patch. Leave Mike to
it. He knows what he’s doing. Don’t you Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Exactly. He’s an idiot. He organised 3,000
tents and sanitation packs for Rwanda.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right…is that not…?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They needed them in Luanda. Angola. It’s been
in the news. And that’s the end of the tour. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look, I understand your hostility to new wood
coming in..</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: There’s a lot of really important people you
need to know about, but I haven’t got time.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey, boss.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier – Malcolm. He’s
a bit of an…alpha male, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look, I’ve managed to get you into the big
meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really? Sure.
How did you…?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I did it through sheer bloody hard work.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Tobes here has got me into the big Karen
Clark meeting.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Wow. Yeah, the Big Meet. How are you spelling
that, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Two `e’s.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Just, maybe, might be best not to get too
excited. It might be that their guys muscle in and have the lion’s share
of the talk time.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah. It might be like that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I think I can work a room, okay? I’m not a
room virgin.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Ah, Michael? I’m Chad.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: We’d like a dual horse-shoe formation for the
meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon
delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we
request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My God. Who was that, Young
Lankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh he’ll be running something relatively
major. They’re all kids in Washington. It’s like Bugsy Malone, but with
real guns.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No-one will hear me if I say anything. How’s
your view? Can we swap?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can I swap with you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I think the meeting’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, quickly then, swap.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: We all agree this is a very tough time, but I
don’t want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is
necessarily the primary option at this point.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are people thinking that? That’s – a bit
hardcore.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, this is worse. Swap back.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza
Weld. You don’t mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Illuminates the logistical factors we face.
She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can’t
envision a theatre deployment for twelve months.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Although not everyone might agree with
the assumptions made in that paper.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Really - such as what?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: The committee feels a much quicker
deployment is possible.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Which committee?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: This has been discussed in a number of
committees. If I said one committee…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>adriano</strong>: Then that was a slip of the tongue</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Have you accidentally alluded to some secret
committee? A war committee?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If I can interject here, I’m aware we’re
pushed for time. I’d like to move us on agenda-wise. Our next item is
international relief co-ordination.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Have you heard of this committee?</p>
<p><strong>adriano</strong>: What’s this Liza Weld paper?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Should I say something? She invited me, I
should say something. If you don’t say something in the first 10
minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know whether you should say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m saying something … I think I’m going to
try saying something.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look - I just think it’s worth noting that
Ministers in The UK Government, such as our colleague here …</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is she talking about me?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Simon Foster …</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: She’s talking about me!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Has made it clear that for them currently war
is unforeseeable. Isn’t that right Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, yes, I mean, that’s what I said. And I
stick to what I said.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But that doesn’t mean that what I said won’t
ever change. It’s not imutable. Or mutable. It’s an ongoing …</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I wonder if there aren’t some area of
mutual agreement we can’t rattle through here and see how much time we
have at the end for this discussion?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Is that all fine?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s all fine. Thanks for that.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Come here - we need to talk What do you mean
stop being a `tit’? In what way was I being a tit? Why am I even over
here if I’m not meant to say anything?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You were just meat in the room, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: ‘Meat in the room’? Oh for fuck’s sake Judy.
I took an hour out to come over here and be room meat?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But you know you’re a prime cut, you’re not -
offal.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Great, I’m not liver. What was I, tit
meat?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Whichever committee they don’t want me to be
a member of, I want to be a member of that. It’s a confused Groucho
Marx.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Okay. Right.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Hey Liza. Your paper got a major citation. You
must be psyched Karen brought it up.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: She…that was her call. I didn’t know it had
been that widely read.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You could not write anything that clashes more
violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you
were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I wasn’t trying, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You are like the woman from The Omen, you’ve
given birth to a demon and it’s going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You probably identify with the kid from The
Omen right?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Ooh.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: See, you’re an only child, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You bring this up whenever you run out of
arguments. I don’t see how my parents’ limited reproductive abilities
reflects badly on me. I’m the sperm that made it.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Have fun with your career kryptonite.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: conspiratorially to Liza</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My teeth hurt. I think the veneers are
chipped. Do they look chipped?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Well, I think that one, that one’s always been
there, right? I’m not sure. Have you got any painkillers?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, don’t look at my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sshhh!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t want to risk a dentist here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey Liza!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Oh … Hi … hi?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Toby? It’s Toby.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Hi. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are you doing? You look like you’re
practicing baby massage.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college.
I had a small thing for her.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not sure she remembered me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No, that is one of the side effects of
Rohypnol.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Linton has set up a secret war committee, I
just know it. I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic, Liza. He is
dangerous. The voices in his head are now singing barbershop
together.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there’s not
a war. It’s going to be a nightmare. It’s bad enough having to cope with
the fucking Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don’t need
this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Er, you wanted a chance to row back on the
war. Do you want to nail the line?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What? No. No. I’ll freestyle it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Is war unforeseeable Minister?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, …loads of things that are actually very
likely are also unforeseeable. Y’know, For the plane in the fog the
mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and
inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Sorry, are you saying that…?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What I’m saying is that to - walk the road of
peace, sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict.
Thank you!</p>
<p>****: Toby Simon and Judy on the back seat as they drive back to the
Department.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck. Why didn’t we nail
the line?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I did try to warn you.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You did try to warn me but you didn’t
actually stop me, did you?. That’s like shouting ‘Train!’ as I get hit
by a train. You should go ‘Look! Train! There’s a Fucking Train!’</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh shit. It’s Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s Malcolm for me too.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How does he do that? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Simon. I don’t like finding out about
people I work with via the news, unless they’ve died. Get over here now
so we can address at least one of those issues.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The thing is. On the war. With your profile..
… Maybe we should - get it out there? That the war is a resigning issue
for you.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can’t say it’s a resigning issue. Because
you then have to resign.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You are having a really great first day you
know that?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster.
You are supposed to be officer class. Don’t do this. Don’t make
waves.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We can do without the ritual humiliation,
Malcolm. You know I’m against talking up the war.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re against talking up the war? Is that
why you said, “Climb the mountain of conflict”?</p>
<p><strong>mal colm</strong>: Do you know what you sounded like? You
sounded like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m just saying. I might be forced to the
verge of making a stand.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right, you two, The White Stripes,
outside.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There’s only two people in the White
Stripes.</p>
<p>****: Look, I admire you, I really do. Making a stand. So, I take it
I can tell the PM you don’t want to go to Washington?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: To where…?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Washington. The boss wants you over there
on a fact-finder. Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in
the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But you were saying, you are on the verge
of your stand…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, look - I don’t know what words I used
in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense I was on the verge. But
that’s the important thing - I was on the verge. Not in any way
decided.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Christ on a bendy-bus, Simon, stop being
such a faffing fuck-arse.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I am standing my ground on the verge.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, when you go to America, talk to Karen
Clarke at the State Department,</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ll give it a whirl.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But keep away from Linton Barwick. He’s
pushing the war for Caulderwood’s lot. I’ll deal with him. Dangerous
fucker. keeps a live hand-grenade as a paperweight. True story.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh right. I won’t talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Talk to as few people as possible. That
would be best for you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get
me on Linton’s War Committee, get me a dental appointment. Not
necessarily in that order.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Ah. Karen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Linton.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: How was London? Good hotel?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Great hotel, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Good meetings?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes. We had some good discussions. The time
at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then…</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Good. Welcome back. I’ll read your words
when they come through. Thank you so much</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is Chad coming… ?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: He’s doing his desperate chorus girl thing,
hanging around trying to catch Linton’s eye. That’s why he’s wearing his
push-up bra today.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Assistant Secretary of State – hi.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Brad.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Chad</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Uh-huh. Exactly</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Can I…?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So listen, Liza, I need you to find out the
names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Dullest?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Because Linton is not going to call it the
big horrible scarey war committee…they’ll have buried the war committee
under the most boring name they can think of. ‘Diverse Strategy
Committee’- not that, I’m on that. But it’ll be a committee that sounds
so tedious you want to self-harm.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Can you get me General Miller at the
Pentagon? My teeth hurt like hell.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Sick of hearing about the teeth…</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I do not understand why anyone would choose
to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for
perverts.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: I could request the glass be
frosted?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What
happened in London?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen
flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza. She’s obviously trying
to use it as some kind of roadblock. It’s called Pwip Pip.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Pip what?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Pwip Pip.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What is that a report on - birdcalls? What
does that stand for?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: I don’t recall. It’s factish. Intel -
case for and against intervention.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: We’ve got all the facts we need on this. In
the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said
there was another thing?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: In the meeting with the Foreign Office
the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: mouth so he can’t be lip-</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: The war committee.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Karen must not find out about that. She is
an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we
need to correct the record.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: We can do that?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Yes we can. They’re an aide memoir for us.
So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said,
but a more full record of what was intended to be said. I think that’s
the more accurate version, right?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I don’t like this section. Cut that. I don’t
think this is really what France are saying. Let’s change that. And
these. And let’s reverse this.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: That’s something Karen said.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: It’s not right. Change it.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: And I like this.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Let’s say everyone agreed with this.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s she so fucking happy about? Is she
laughing at me?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You want me to order some blinds? Or I could
get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. I do.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh. Okay …</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can we go somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So listen. My team for the US. Team Simon.
I’m thinking of taking you and leaving Judy?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I could work with that, definitely. Plus she
can be a bit… you know? “Everything’s a bit shit isn’t it?”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: “So you’re the President? And I’m supposed to
be impressed by that?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. “My husband works in Tower Hamlets.”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: “That’s much harder than being President”.
Okay. It’s settled. Fuck it. She’s staying behind. Go and tell her.</p>
<p><strong>int. state department. karen’s office - day</strong>: 34
34</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Which brings us on to Any Other Business.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I believe I’ve flagged everything I needed
to discuss. As I usually do.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: mouth, mocking Linton’s</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What is that, Karen</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I understand you’ve started up a new
committee, what’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It was mentioned in our London meeting.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: You must have misheard.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I misheard the word committee?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Maybe it was another word. Like
Khomeini.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re sitting on a new Khomeini?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Possibly. There are a lot of words, Karen.
Kansas City. Kitty.</p>
<p><strong>bob ariano</strong>: Itty.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Itty is not a word, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Commissary?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Thank you, James</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Chad.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ok. Why don’t you just recap for me all the
committees that you’re currently sitting on?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I’m Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding
from your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh don’t try to change the subject
Linton.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Oh no. Holy Mother of….</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I don’t mean to be rude Karen but that is a
tad… repulsive. I can’t concentrate on what you’re saying. You have
blood coming out of your teeth and that’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay, Liza come with me.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen
now.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I don’t like to see a woman bleeding from
the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I
really can’t abide.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yes! Ha ha! Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Actually while we’re on Any Other Business I
do have a few points I’d like to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Where are at you at with the committees?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I got it down to two. The Aims and Policy
Alignment Committee. Here - put some down your front - you don’t want it
to go down your… And the Future Planning Committee.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, it’s not the first one. I set that one
up. Does that really sound dull to you? I thought that was a good
name.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Right, no, it is a good name.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay, find out if it is definitely the Future
Planning Committee.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Okay. Okay. Right, listen, I might go and do
that. You’re not going to shout at me if I go and do that are you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m not a fucking monster Liza, okay? Will
you stop implying I’m some kind of monster?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Liza.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: So listen, Bob, there’s something I really
want to tell you. We’re having a hunk of the month competition, and I
just didn’t want you to be feel…objectified in any way….and</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Karen knows about the Future Planning
Committee.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: This is cool.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Don’t be callow Toby. We’re on official
business.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There will be a car won’t there?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh God yeah, of course.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did you book a car?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Me? No. I mean, Judy will have got someone to
do it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi Judy? Yeah sorry if you’re in bed, but
we’re here and… Just can’t see the car? Wondered what the car situation
was?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What car situation?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The airport car?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s not my job Toby. That’s Robbie’s job to
book it, your job to check it and confirm it. Alright? Good night.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. She’s really embarrassed. Sounds like a
snarl up her end. I’ll see what we can do?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: `Simon Forester?’</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi we’re the Simon Foster party?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I almost feel like there should be hookers.
Do you know what I mean? Really, here, we should have hookers.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hey Gav, I’m in a fucking motorcade!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You want girls?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What? Oh no. God no. No no no no no. I was
just - I was just joking. I don’t want hookers. I hate hookers. I mean
not in an aggressive way. I’m just not interested. But thanks. Thanks
very much.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s like a hangar for businessmen.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Toby, have you….?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I haven’t been to an ATM yet…I’ve only got
English….</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s supposed to be a dollar a bag.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Technically, you’ve got a Capitol Hill
view.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Hey Karen. You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I bet you say that to all the girls.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Yeah I do. And some of the guys.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s why you shouldn’t run for Senate. Too
many skeletons in your enormous closet.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Yeah, don’t believe the hype. I’m
just thinking about doing … something. I’m more than just a soldier,
Karen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s right, you’re passionate about
education and housing and what’s the other thing?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: And bestiality.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’d forgotten about that. Are you still
allergic to that dog?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Yes, yes. I wake up and my eyes are
closed and my head is swollen and I look like a giant ball sack.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh my god, they do have memdication for
that…..but a beautiful ball sack, though. And how’s the pentagon?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: It’s kicked up a level. Talking
invasion real soon.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is there somewhere we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t live in this
house.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What if someone comes in now?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I can’t think of an excuse that
would work can you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No. Just be careful. Don’t mess stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Okay so that’s total minimum
European Theatre requirement.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: This is Far East, Korea, Japan
etc.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Add those. Plus contingency already
deployed.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Er - you’ve lost me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Your military hardware is impressive.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Not anymore it isn’t. Okay so this
is total current deployment. Europe, Asia. And the contingency already
deployed. So the current number of combat troops available for an
invasion according to these figures would be …</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thousand?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: No, twelve. Twelve soldiers.
Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re shitting me.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Of course I’m shitting you, but 12
thousand isn’t enough. Twelve thousand’s about how many are going to
die. And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it
looks like you’ve lost.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Uh-huh. Tomorrow I’ve got to meet these
Brits. Simon Foster. He’s the guy that said war was unforseeable, and I
think he could very useful on the committee because he could
internationalise the dissent.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: You’re going to use him as a little
meat puppet.</p>
<p><strong>int. washington hotel - toby’s room.</strong>: 47 47</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Tobes. Hi. So! What’s the plan? What swanky
reception are we going to?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’s the plan? For tonight?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well that’s what I’m asking you Toby, my
chief aide, my political advisor.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know, I thought tonight we’d be
tired?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well I am tired but I’m also a career
politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for
forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out
rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark
documentary, because I’m scared if I watch a porno it’ll end up in the
Register of Members Interests. So what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay … What have I got?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Don’t bullshit me Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay - so far, we have … one flyer under the
door for happy hour in the bar - which might be interesting? And I have
the number of a guy I was with at Uni who I believe now works for CNN
out here.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Liza, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Waving at you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Make yourself more visible.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m practically on top of you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You can stop talking on your phone now. Look,
I have to leave. Phone Simon Foster’s guy. Tell them to come to the war
committee. I’ll give them some face time around ten o’clock. It’ll be
coffee and Danish…tea..they’re going to want tea. Tea and sympathy. Tea
and a handjob, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Hey Toby! It’s Liza Weld. Do you remember?
What you guys doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tv narrator</strong>: There is still a great deal that is
unknown about great white shark mating behaviour…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well it is unbelievably hectic.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can definitely spot the female ones can’t
you?!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Attending the war committee. That’s big. I
mean, I have been on a committee before. “Challenges for the cheese
market” - that was a big one… but…yes, sure I’d love a drink. Forty
minutes? Great. Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello? Hi? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Matty, hi, How’s CNN? yes – sorry? Do I sound
muffled?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Come in….I just wasn’t expecting you to be
here. Physically here. Obviously, you’re always in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m here, I’m there, I’m fucking
everywhere. I am the egg-man.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Have you come to insult me in a different
time zone?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, off out now for a drink with her…yeah,
yeah, ha-di-ha, but nothing’s going to happen there. Little Toby’s
staying in his hammock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Simon, I’ve managed to get us on the…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hello!!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Fuck! Malcolm! Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re meant to shit yourself in there. Not
out here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right. I’ve got us on to Linton’s Future
Planning Committee in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Okay. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s the war committee.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What? The actual….war committee?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, Liza says that…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who’s going to be there?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon. Simon and
me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who else is going – Jimmy Osmond? Gwyneth
Paltrow? You’ve been invited to a diversion. The real committee, the
real thing, that’s happening at The White House.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah well, I’ll text you the details because
I’m going to go out.for A quick drink with some State Department
bods.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t mention this to the press, ok? Don’t
mention it to anyone. Because if the press get a whiff there’s a war
committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to
turn up and try and get on it. So no matter what gay bar you end up,
keep it schtumm.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I was watching that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I have to have a word with you. You might
want to slip into your negligee.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You see those guys? The mosh pit?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more
civilised ‘mosh pit’ it’s more of a mosh caucus actually.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: House staffers, Senators’ interns, most of
them are half-man half-PDF file. Tonight they rage hard. Tomorrow they
go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re worried.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s Pwip Pip.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m sorry? Pip Pip? Is this… a person or a
cell phone tarrif or..</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s my paper. On the war. Pros and Cons of
the war. But I came up with too many cons. The pro-war guys have started
calling me `Connie’. So, yes I’m fucking worried. My career’s on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah- I noticed you’re worried, cos I saw you
looking worried. I’m perceptive like that. But… Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Okay, this place blows. I’m going. What are
you doing?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well I’m incredibly tired. It feels like my
brain’s eight hours behind but my liver’s 12 hours ahead.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You don’t want to come back to my place for a
quick catch up?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: However, due to technological developments I
no longer need sleep, but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol!</p>
<p><strong>56 int. liza’s apartment - night 56</strong>: Toby and Liza
are on the bed together, kissing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Could I just say, you know, that what happens
in Washington stays in Washington?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Yeah I live in Washington. So that doesn’t
really work for me.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. washington hotel - evening 57</strong>: Malcolm is
still in Simon’s room. He’s texting. Simon sneaks the remote and flips
from the news back to the shark doc. Malcolm, without looking up, picks
up the remote and flicks back to the news.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We are under enormous pressure Simon. Karen
will want you to say,
<code>war is unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to talk up</code>climbing
the mountain of conflict’. You say nothing, okay? You can’t swing both
ways, you’re not David fucking Bowie.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Right. Can I go to bed now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, we’re going to run that through.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Am I being tortured?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello I need a number for a taxi in Washington
DC. Straight through please.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello. I need a cab, right now. From? From
where? From from</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s 40, 46, that’s the number, and it’s a
street. It’s a nice street with houses and cars and a - sidewalk and
it’s got leaves and - hold on I’m walking, I’m walking to a sign …</p>
<p><strong>60 ext. washington street 60</strong>: Toby running.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Marcel’s is good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You should go to La Taverna, the Greek place.
It’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: They set fire to the cheese. It’s a lot of
fun.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It sounds a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s the aerospace museum, the National
Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do they set fire to the paintings?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi I’m sorry I’m so late.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And this is your guy?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. He’s, you know, among my guys.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m Karen. And I believe you already know
Liza.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes. From college, in England.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Pulled an all-nighter?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, I, uh, got led astray.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh who by?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Uh, well I ran into - people. There’s some
people from - the MoD over and …</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Not Penny Grayling?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Er - no, another - gang?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Right. Wow. I didn’t know you had so many
delegations in town.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The British are coming!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, I need to just check out a couple of
things … this seems like a good point to break things up.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Er - no problem.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s been great.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I really appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Was that…?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Toby – I don’t want to read you the riot act
here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act.
Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don’t leave your boss twisting in
the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.
`The British are coming’?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So I turned up late to the meeting Simon. I’m
sorry. But it’s not like I threw up in there.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No you’re right. I should be thanking you for
not throwing up. Well done. You’re a star. You didn’t wet yourself,
you’re in the right city, you didn’t say anything overtly racist, you
didn’t pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting ‘willy
banjo’. No I’m being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually
being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my
career. You’re a legend.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That was just - the first bit was it? We’re
going back in do you …think?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We’d barely said hello. I’ve had muggings
that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable
cheese.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Are these all requests to get on the
committee? What’s going on? Did someone post an invite on Facebook? I’m
drowning in Senators. It’s Senator soup here.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi Liza.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Hey Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Yes, I’m feeling fine. Why were you late?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Because…you know…you didn’t wake me up.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You looked so sweet. I thought you knew what
you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I was asleep, of course I didn’t. That’s how
people walk out of windows.</p>
<p><strong>staffer</strong>: Hey Liza, I’ve got another call about the
Committee from Senator Crudden’s office, he wants in too.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What is going on here? Fuck. Why’s this my
problem? Toby you sure you didn’t do bad? You didn’t mention the
committee to anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Nada. Nada.. Bad-da. Nada-bada bing-bong
ding-dang-dong. I have no idea what I’m saying anymore I think I really
am still quite drunk.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Everyone is so hot for your paper. I’m running
off another ten copies. It’s spreading like a virus, Liza. You’re in hot
water. You’re lobsterising.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t feel that.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: It’s by degrees. Wafting. Bisque. I smell
lobster. Can you smell lobster, Toby?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Mate!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I need to…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: So, how far would you go with Linton, you
freaky little stalker? Downtown? Or all the way up Brokeback
Mountain?</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: How are you today? Beat the traffic?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah yeah. Hunky dory. Can I get a
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: eventually does and just puts it on a chair,
not the</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your assistant?</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Yeah. So, Item. We need to have a conversation
about the mood of the British Parliament. Any bumps in the road
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m sorry son, am I - is this it? No
offence, but shouldn’t you be at school with your head down a
toilet?</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Your first point there, the offence. I’m
afraid I’m gonna have to take it. Your second point. I’m 22. But - item
- It’s my birthday in nine days, so if it would be more comfortable we
could… wait…?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t get sarcastic with me son. We burnt
this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and I’m all for doing it
again. Starting with you, you frat fuck. You get sarcastic with me again
and I will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it’ll come
out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny. Okay? I thought…I
was led to believe I was attending the war committee.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Yes, Assistant Secretary of State Linton
Barwick wanted me to brief you on the work of the Future Planning
Committee.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t want the bullshit son, I want the
bull. No one sidelines me. I’m away.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And here we go - the fucking Vice President
has also graced us with his presence!</p>
<p>****: Where is the fucking war committee meeting?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Simon’s going to the war committee I thought
you knew?</p>
<p>****: I thought I was going to the war committee? Tell me where the
fuck it’s happening!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s on the 7th floor in room 712. Oh Malcolm,
do you like how I’m telling you what’s going on where you are?</p>
<p>****: Well let me tell you what’s going on where you are sweet heart,
a certain vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is about to find that she’s
out of a fucking job…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Here she comes - shit - look like we’re
meeting, look like we’re having a meeting!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: … and if you look … at the line they take in
Newsweek - that’s very much … another narrative.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: See you at the committee.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, yeah sure, see you in a mo. Just
finishing off some stuff. Okay, we’re all done there. Let’s roll.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t think you can say that anymore here.
They don’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Shut up. Follow them. Don’t lose them. Lets
rock.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you joining me or shall I see you
there?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: See you there. I don’t need to … do any of
the things you need to go in there to do, so I’ll just see you
there.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: We seem to be overrun with insurgents here,
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Hi, I’m in seat 204, row W. Will I
be able to see the big screen from there? Oh, and can I get one of those
big pointy foam hands with `Go, Monster Trucks!’ written on it?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: The general is on rare form, very rare
form.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: There he is. General George Miller.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Right, yep. There he is.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s the second time in 24 hours I’ve had a
partially obscured view of him.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Okay, due to the fact that seemingly
everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting,
we’ll be relocating to a bigger room. Room 720. So, if you will be so
kind…</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Just so you know – Karen and I did
not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to
find out about this committee.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Well, you’re both here now. John and
Yoko.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: You and I need to talk, mano-a-mano,
cocks on the block, about how things are operating around here at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my
office?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>adriano</strong>: I have no idea how they all heard sir.
There must have been a leak.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Look at Adriano. Poor fuck. He looks
like he’s with his Daddy: “Sorry, Bob, you’re adopted. From a couple
with hereditary heart defects.”</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: “And your mother only ever kept your baby
clothes for the purposes of voodoo.”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m room meat again. This is a massive
abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside.
Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump
him.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh no. I want to stay in here with Miller.
Don’t make me pump Chad.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m making you pump Chad. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’ll be easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No it won’t. It’ll be difficult difficult
lemon difficult.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged
session of the Future Planning Committee. You can all see an agenda?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Assistant Secretary – here on point 6, it
feels like there’s an assumption that we’ll be invading. Should we talk
about the practical? I mean this is the war committee after all?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: It’s the Future Planning Committee.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Unofficially it’s known as the war
committee.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Well, unofficially we can call anything
whatever we like. Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it’s not a shoe,
Karen, it’s a glass of water, and this is the Future Planning
Committee.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But what I’m asking is has a decision been
reached in principle to advocate invasion?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: That’s way off agenda Karen. Although it
would seem a general consensus may be forming.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Well I noted with interest the recent
comments of our colleague Simon Foster in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Perhaps Mr. Foster would have something to
say about that?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m just…watching with interest. IN Britain
we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that
it’s `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.’</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: As I say it seems a consensus is
forming.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s just ridiculous. You have no basis for
saying that.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Karen, please, calm down. We don’t want you
to have another hemorrhage. Item One.</p>
<p><strong>int. state department - day</strong>: 74 74</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So - do you want to go out and get some
lunch?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Are you kidding? Lunchtime is work time.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, what an incredibly depressing motto. You
see you’re playing into the hands of the French saying that.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yeah work hours are too valuable - for
networking. You gotta get in at like 6 work till 8.30 Then start making
those connections baby. Emails and admin at lunch. See if you can play
some strategic racquetball through the pm. Then in the six till midnight
slot chow down on some serious policy work.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right. And what - friends, family, novels,
sexual inter-course you’re going to save those for your thirties and
forties?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you fucking me about?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Mr Tucker, isn’t it? Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You might pull this kind of stunt on some
young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy to be getting his hookers paid
for by tobacco lobbyists, but not me.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ve just had a briefing from a 9-year- old
finalist in Americas got talent. I think he may have been a
ventriloquist. Or possibly the fucking dummie.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: AJ? He is one of my top guys. Stanton
College Prep, Harvard…he’s smart and he’s great at his job.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: His fucking briefing notes were written in
Alphabetti Spaghetti. When I left I nearly tripped over his umbilical
cord.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I’m sorry if it troubles you that our people
achieve excellence at a young age.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: By the way, your prime minister informs me
that he’s tasked you with collating some fresh British intel for us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah, apparently your fucking master race
of gifted toddlers can’t quit get the job done in between breast feeds
and playing with their power rangers. So yeah, we’re getting some actual
grown-ups to bail you out.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Minister, thank you so much for your support
and your recent “Climb the mountain of conflict” comment - great. We’re
going to run with that, it has great repeatability.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Thanks very much, but…it’s all a bit complex
really, in terms of my…</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: It’s early days, my friend. All roads lead
to Munich.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What the fuck does that mean? `All roads
lead to Munich’?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well it just means…I guess, I don’t know what
it means.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: `All roads lead to Munich’?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come on let’s go, get back to the hotel,
nick as many coat hangers as you can. We’re off back to London.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: If you pull it out, America deflates.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t mock that! The closest you’ll come to
getting one of those is buying a Toblerone. Mark Hadley’s dad’s
died.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Nah, I’ll send him a ouija board so they
can keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So what are we getting back to? Apart from a
nice cup of tea and some knife crime?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Constituency surgery in Northampton.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Great, meeting my constituents. It’s like
being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you’re
mental.’</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Sorry, could you…? You just need to kick the
bottom quite hard.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look at them. They all have that smell….like
a charity shop, you know? Afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Right, here you go, you’re pretty booked up -
there’s a list on the desk. I’m just going to have a look at the
guttering.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m just back from America, so it was pretty
tough to make it up here - but you know. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Of course. Right. How was the President?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Good actually.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: And what was the White House like?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Blown up by spaceships.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Twelve-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Um, hold on General …</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted
me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it’s over-running. He
sends apologies.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: He stood me up? They’re better be a fucking
good reason. Like he’s dead. That is just plain fucking rude. I mean,
how would he like it if I just did a big hairy shit on his desk?</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: You’re very w-welcome to wait, we have
newspapers and periodicals?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yeah well excuse me if at this time of
national crisis I don’t sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through Time
magazine eating pop tarts? Tell him to call me. But he might not get
through cos I’m a fucking busy man.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hey, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yeah - can I hang around in here for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Er. Sure. Why?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Do I need a fucking reason? Linton’s playing
me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look, I was going to order food, do you want
to eat.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yeah. Order us some cute mammals. Alive. A
lamb or a piglet so I can snap it’s fucking neck.</p>
<p><strong>int. constituency surgery - day</strong>: 80 80</p>
<p><strong>mrs mcdairmid</strong>: My point is - if the septic tank - if
we didn’t know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible
for it now?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. No. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mcdairmid</strong>: It’s under the communal drive. Why
should we get it pumped?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Well it’s not a council sceptic tank so they’re
not legally obliged to pump it…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mcdairmid</strong>: Look, according to the paperwork
there’s four metric tons of of shit under there. That’s not all me, is
it? I’m not a flipping elephant am I?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, of course not. Nor should you be treated
like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid. Leave it with me. I’m sure there must be
a way through this. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Er, Colin Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Jesus. Still on about bendy buses? No. Tell
him no. What else?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Pauline Michaelson’s son about the constituency
office wall.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Hi, thanks for seeing me
Mr. Foster.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hi Paul, call me Simon. You’ve met Roz.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: I know I have.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Okay, Simon, I’ll try to keep it
brief because I can see you’re a busy man. There’s a bloke out there
wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for
the mentally dispossessed. And for sensible people like yourself,
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Patronising.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Why don’t you explain your issue, Mr
Michaelson?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: I…sorry, is this a joke? How many
times? For the fourth f…ing time. The side wall. Of this property. Your
wall. Is falling over. On to my mum’s garden. She called you up - but
she got fobbed off by your people. Because she’s not Lord Snooty in his
posh car. Because she’s not Madonna on a horse.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That…I agree, it’s unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Do you know what this is? That’s
your constituency office hold music. I don’t want it in my head, do
I?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We did arrange to get a quote from a builder,
but…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Patch from London. They say it’s urgent. Karen
Clark? Is she the coracle woman?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Right. Paul, I really need to take this, but
I haven’t forgotten about you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: No, well I’m not going anywhere,
Simon. You won’t be able to forget me because I’ll be sitting here
staring at you.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Toby, can I hand Paul over to you?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: “Can I fob Paul off with you?”</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So, Paul, where are we up to? I was out
getting coffee. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: See, this is the problem with
civilians wanting to go to war. When you’ve been there you don’t want to
go back unless you absolutely have to. It’s like France.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You finally read Liza’s paper?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Course, I read it. I’m a voracious
reader. I’m the fucking Gore Vidal of the Pentagon. You don’t want
that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes I want that. I want that, that, that,
that and that. Those I don’t care about. And these let’s pack up and
drop on North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Someone should leak this.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Someone maybe shaped a little bit like
you.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Me? Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You have more gravitas.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Exactly. I’m too senior. I can’t
leak. Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out
there. It’s insane. Not only is the case against war incredibly strong,
the case for is caveated to hell. “Most analysts believe the state is
looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders…” Then here in the
caveats, the only source is `Ice Man’ - a possible alcoholic - who’s
probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in
his fucking vodka tonics. INR say we can’t trust him. That’s us
disputing our own findings. Has Linton read this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m not sure he reads. You’re a General. Have
him killed.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: You see this is why we never got
together. That and the hobo teeth.</p>
<p><strong>intercut phone call:</strong>: Page 74</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This is a private call right – unrecorded,
secure line etc etc?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, yeah. I mean, your lot are probably
getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: I’m still here, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’s going on Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Departmental business. About a wall.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Gaza?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh-huh. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Where were you in the committee? I called for
back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit. Maybe worse, cos at a
molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say
Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I’m playing the long game.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There is no long game. They’ve bounced us
into a short game. You looked like a…what do you call it in England? A
’wanker</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We don’t call it that, no…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Paul, look, mate…</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Patronising.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sorry. But I’m on your side. I have to look
after my Mum too. You do, or they get shafted don’t they? So…</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: I’m going to pursue this with, what
do they call it? Extreme prejudice, to the very end. I can be enormously
persistent. Ask my ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Okay, well, I’ll take your details.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That guy’s a bit full-beam.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Full-beam?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, full-beam. Headlights. I kept thinking,
is he going to nut me. He appears not to be nutting me, but he might
well nut me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So what did Karen Clark want?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do you think I came over as weak on the
committee over there?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, uh, no, of course not. I suppose -</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Also - the war committee got leaked, and that
leak came from your department.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I find that difficult to believe.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I want action to be taken. I want a head. On
a plate. To go.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You don’t work here. You’re not my boss. Fuck
off. You can’t make me sack people.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We need to talk in my office.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I think you know.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sorry, this is the wrong extension. I’ll put
you through now.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Come, come into my office.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why? Why do you need to see me?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s the mad man about the wall.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The war?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The wall.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can you come into my office so I can tell you
off?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You fucker. No, not you.</p>
<p><strong>86 int. paul michaelson’s garden/int. dfid - continuous
86</strong>: Wall man Paul is on the phone, standing with a JOURNALIST
by the offending wall, now badly propped up. The journalist is taking
notes and photographs.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What can I do for you Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: These `temporary buttresses’ you
got put up.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: They’re basically a pair of twigs.
Thin twigs.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m sure they’re not twigs.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: No they’re twigs. Are you getting a
picture of those twigs? That wall could fall on my mum and crush her. Do
you know how old she is? Mum, how old are you? I want to tell the
newspaper guy.</p>
<p><strong>mum</strong>: Sixty.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I want a word with the minister and
Charlotte Fucking Bronte.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: You’re never fucking sixty. You’re
older than that. Sixty. How old are you really?</p>
<p><strong>mum</strong>: I’m sixty. If it’s going in a newspaper, I’m
sixty.</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: Fuck off are you sixty. Olivia
Newton- John’s fucking sixty. And she’s not on the statins, is she?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Could you tell your mum to stay away from the
wall just for the time being?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: She needs to get to her plants. She
has to water them. Plants need water.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, sure, but could she use a hose, from a
distance?</p>
<p><strong>paul michaelson</strong>: She doesn’t have a hose, she’s got
a watering can. This is like talking to a brick wall about a brick wall.
Get that down, that’s gold.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Liza, what’s up? Why is everyone running
around? This better be a fucking fire drill.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: The President has said he’s vetoing tarrifs on
Chinese auto imports.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Abbey, get me the president’s statement.</p>
<p><strong>abbey</strong>: Mr Barwick has asked me to…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You work to me, Abbey, you fucking work to
me. Get me the statement. Or I will call security and have you escorted
off the premises via the window.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Sorry, why is that…? He’s…what, buttering the
Chinese up?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He needs them to at least abstain in the
security council.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: We’re going to the UN.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes, we’re going to the UN.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I should be told this fucking stuff! I’m
going into Linton’s office and pulling the pin on his grenade.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m fucking joking.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why didn’t you know about this?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Well since I created the budget deficit the
President doesn’t tend to run things by me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t get funny with me. I am not in the
mood.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No. I’m getting that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: “While Foster jets around at the taxpayer’s
expense, his constituency headquarter’s wall’s collapsing and he doesn’t
give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It doesn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No but it says `Wall-ace and Gromitt’</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Wall-ace though?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You are being portrayed as the biggest twat
in Northamptonshire, and that’s going some.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It is just a wall, Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Listen, my little stem cell, I don’t want
to be dealing with this either, okay? I’ve got bigger fucking fish to
fry, believe me. I’m rolling blue whales in breadcrumbs at the moment.
I’m giving this to Jamie.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh great. The crossest man in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Humpty-Numpty…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What is this, surround bollocking?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: With respect, I haven’t finished. If it isn’t
Humpty-Numpty, sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless
egg- cunt.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hi Jamie.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Okay, that’s enough of the fucking Oxbridge
pleasantries.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How is saying “hello” a…</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Shut it, Love, Actually, or I’ll hole- punch
your face.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right, I’m off to deal with the fate of the
planet, okay?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t look at me like that’s arrogant. That
is just a fucking fact. Don’t even look at me. Be gentle with them.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You know me, Malcy, kid gloves. Made from
real kids.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Right, Butch and Gaydance, this wall story is
playing badly. Look, here’s a cartoon of you as a walrus.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A walrus? I’m not fat. I don’t even have a
moustache.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look…we hired some builders. They didn’t turn
up when they said they would.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: They’re builders. What did you expect?! Have
you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder? No. Because they never
turn up in the fucking nick of time.That’s why you never see a superhero
with a hod.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: This is all getting…this is a really
stressful job, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh come on, you’re not a brain surgeon, you’re
not a snooker player …</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t want to back a war, Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, drop some hints, put some nods and
winks out there, that I’m toying with resignation. Yeah? See if the PM
reacts. See how it plays.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Put out some winks?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And nods.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Big nods?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, no, just sort of… That sort of size
nod.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, not that much.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No, I was just nodding normally to say I
understood the need for a small nod.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Oh. Good.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So, my lovely friends, bottom line…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I hate that phrase. We’re not in
retailing</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sorry Michael, I promise never to use it
again.</p>
<p><strong>mal colm</strong>: Bottom line, is that the President is
going to the UN, and the PM would like us to join him. This will be the
voe to commence military action. So, Rob, Innis, Little Bo Cock Jockey
And the leaky fucking mingebox, return to your desks and prepare for
some extreme briefing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Now then, you still got doubts, Complicated
Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going to
spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. We fight
people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that’s exactly the
sort of thing I didn’t want to do when I went into politics. That’s the
opposite of what I want to be doing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s why you’ve got to stay in
Government. In here you can influence things, delay things. Out there
you’re just another mad shouty fucker people don’t want to make
eye-contact with. Remember Mary? She took a stand over Health. Everyone
decided she was mental.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Only because the Sun showed a photo of her
with wide eyes and her head on a cow.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I found that a very powerful image. Look,
the Prime Minister of this country is not a Viking. He doesn’t drink
blood, he doesn’t go round biting tramps. He doesn’t go to Chequers at
the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I know the Prime Minister isn’t a Viking,
Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Unlike me, the man abhors physical
violence.</p>
<p>****: Page 85</p>
<p><strong>mal colm</strong>: He’s a grade A fucking pussy and he knows
you have similar concerns and he wants your input on this. Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Where’s the intelligence? Where’s the hard
evidence?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Listen, We’ve got evidence harder than a
diamond dildo. We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking
puncture your kidneys.There’s an informant, `Ice Man’, OK? The stuff
he’s giving us? It’ll make your blood run cold. And clot. Your insides
will turn to black pudding. …now, certain box-lickers are sitting on it.
But you’re going to see it, because the PM regards you as a key player
now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Judy Molloy? Ten minutes. Thanks. Prime
Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, Simon. He want you to go
the</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: See- you’re A-list now. You’re a Kennedy.
In the VIP lounge, with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and
the hard-on.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Show me the evidence, Malcolm, that’s my
fucking bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So do you still want…nods and winks?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Cheers everyone. Here’s to surviving
another day.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a lab out
of bits of old psychopath.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello ladies.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: And gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello ladies. I’m just going to -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh. Lovely. I think we could have another
bottle of Sancerre.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: If you can afford it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: If you can get served at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Fucking hell. Here we go again. Fucking
arsehole.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re kidding? What’s it say? Woah!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What a twat. What are you doing? Are you
replying?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah I wouldn’t want to meet Jamie in a dark
alley. Or a bright alley. The whole thing of just being in an alley with
him would be scary, regardless of the lighting.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: You’ve got a text.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh yeah. It’s just Rob about football.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: So, Liza. You shagged her?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What? No.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been
getting his flakey end away?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know anything about his flakey
end.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Could we not talk about accusations and,
health issues, in the pub?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: You haven’t finished your drink.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. I mainly have.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know, it was a weird, intense time
over there. It was…maybe, subconsciously, I don’t know, it was a kind of
last ditch attempt to stop this, awful…war.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s classic. That’s definitely going in
the memoirs.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: You had sex because of the war?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: In the broad sense. Sorry, can you stop doing
that? Can we go somewhere where they’re aren’t enormous children eating
snacks?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Actually I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shall we stay?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I should go. I’ve got a long walk ahead of me.
But that’ll keep me going.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. toby’s flat - evening 92</strong>: Toby lets himself
into the flat. Goes through to the kitchen. Suzy is there with
Michael.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What the fuck is he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What?! What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well I live here.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: No you don’t actually. I’ll go make that
tea.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, if I’m leaving, I’m taking my brie.</p>
<p>****: Page 89</p>
<p><strong>tob y</strong>: And the port. And my Nando’s peri-peri
sauce.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Don’t forget your hydrocortisone.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You putting this in your memoirs as well?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: No, it’s fine. Stay.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Where’s my needlecord jacket?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Your geography teacher’s jacket?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s not how you fold.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Michael, this is one of the more humiliating
moments of my life. I can pack a bag.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The key to travelling is packing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not going to fucking Fiji Michael, I’m
being chucked out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’ll save time the other end.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: There is no other end.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Has she got big tits?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Massive. Enormous. You can see them on Google
Earth. They’ve got their own postcode.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: See you then.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look, Suzy, this is probably going to sound
odd under the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Quickie?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No. Thank you. But no. It’s about Liza.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Oh good tell me more, tell me more about her
tits.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Listen, Suze, Liza wrote a paper, Pwip- Pip. I
think, if it got leaked, it could stop the war.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Good tactic. Get earnest. I tried that with
the wife. Didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: You are such a fucking coward, you know that?
And this is what? A make up leak?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Does such a thing exist?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Toby, take your rubbish clothes and your back
issues of Mojo, your flute, and your eighth of dope and leave me the
fuck alone.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Should I resign? I’ve floated that I might,
when I thought I wouldn’t, so it’ll look convincing if I did. I mean, do
you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war’?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Or is it actually braver to say, `I don’t
agree, but I’m going to grit my teeth and get on with it?’ Is the really
brave thing actually doing what you don’t believe?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Though – maybe? What’s brave about doing the
`right thing’? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I
mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that
worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I
mean not a good idea but …</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I know what you mean. And the Crimean War –
we got nurses out of that.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Nurses are good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Exactly. So…right. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So you’re not resigning?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, I.. where’s Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: In the motorcade. Let’s get a car without
Judy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You want hookers? You like hooky fucky?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I want to talk about the resigning thing.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Still?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But with you and not her. She has this air of
moral righteousness that inhibits you from… saying anything morally
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So. The wires are all currently reporting
that you’re going to resign from government over the war.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What? That wasn’t supposed to get
outside.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah well it is outside. It’s lurking
outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you know, if I could I’d punch you into
total paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>int. un building - day</strong>: 97 97</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt.
This is it. The United Nations.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s all a bit `blurrrgh’, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It could do with a few more scatter cushions
and a bit less asbestos.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: I don’t know what you were expecting –
Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery… great
fountains…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s a shithole. It looks like a hospice
for robots.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Linton Barwick is in there. Karen
Clark is there. You’re right here.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: If you need anything, just whistle.
You know how to whistle don’t you Malcolm? You just put your lips
together and blow.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Right. I’m off upstairs to the
informal delegates’ reception. Hope there’s nibbles, I’m ravenous.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Fuck the nibbles, what was with the homoerotic
tension?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Jamie. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No fucking signal down here. Jesus. I’d be
better off in an internet cafe in Kircoddy.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Okay, your phone’s off, which means you’ve
been shot dead by a fat American, but there’s been a fucktastrophe.
Someone’s leaked Liza Weld’s Pwip Pip paper to the BBC. I reckon it’ll
be on the Six O’Clock news here, one o’clock your time, so it’s going to
fist your fucking vote apart. Missing you loads, pwip-pip,
toodle-oo!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip
Pip leaker and kill them. That’s one job. Job one has two parts. Job
two: stop Pwip Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that
the fat arses at the BBC dither till after the vote, okay? After the
vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do not move from this spot or I’ll fucking
stab you.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, what? No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But you know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, but whatever it was I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So it must have been you Woman from The
Crying Game?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It wasn’t me. You’ve really got it in for me
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Someone’s dropped a bollock in the noodles
and I reckon it was you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’ve done this all before. You accused me of
leaking last time and it wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah well I know you didn’t leak last time.
But what I reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked
this time.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little wet
nose out alright?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m just saying psychologically speaking that
sounds plausible - that you might build up a resentment and then pay it
off in some underhand way. That’s just something I’ve observed.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come on, Baldermort, I need a word.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sorry about that - it’s just … something I’ve
observed.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Wanker. It’s okay. It’s fine. It’s probably
just the stress of this awful, awful war.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We’re in a new reality now and You’ve got
to speed things up.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: What things? Speed up what?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The debate. It needs to start at eleven
o’clock, not one thirty.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Hehe. Can I perhaps briefly explain
the way the process works? And why that isn’t possible? You see through
that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing
what we call the washing up now…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise
you’ll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your
arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that
sustained sexual violence is not the way forward.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: No, it can’t be. I mean it could be
done, it just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then I’ll do it. They’re through there?</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Yes but you can’t go in, that would be
a serious breach of protocol …</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then you do it. Get in there.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: I’m not dancing with you Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m leading, look follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: You’re not dancing me into the
secretariat!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where’s the intel? Are you sure you’re
working as hard as me? Cos I’m sweating spinal fluid here. I’m a
husk.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You get everything you need?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh yeah I think so. Thanks. Oh, Whoa whoa
whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you leak Pwip
Pip? I know you can’t fire a gun, but can you use a fax?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: No, see, because I’m upfront about what I
do. I don’t creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other
people’s dirty work.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m doing my own work. I’m doing my
job.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Uh-hu. I think you’re doing Linton’s dirty
work. I think you’re his English bitch and if I walked into your hotel
room tonight I’d find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out
the back of you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General.
What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof
and go back to sleep why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Listen, Tucker, you may be some
scary poodlefucker back in London, but here? You know what you look
like? A fucking squeezed dick. You got a blue vein running all the way
up to your temple there. That’s where I’d put the fucking bullet. But
I’d stand well back. You look like you’d be a squirter.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Have you ever even killed anybody?
Really?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Falling asleep on someone doesn’t
count.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I’ve done my share. How many you
kill, pussy drip?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Personally, I prefer maiming.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Go on, tough guy, take a swing at
me. I’ll smack you so fucking hard you’ll be shitting teeth.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Go ahead. I can see the headlines now.
‘Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene’. I don’t
know, I’m no expert on spin but could that hurt your career?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right. Do excuse me. I’ve got work to do.
Oh, and don’t EVER call me fucking English again.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Hello everyone. I was wondering if I
might suggest a cheeky early vote? Bit of an adventure. Maybe, we could
knock off early, go for a drink? Ha. I’m kidding. Or am I? No, I am.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There it is. Simon’s going. Everyone’s saying
he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Simon! There he is! Simon. This is
great shit. I wasn’t sure you had the nerve. You’re resigning?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ah okay. They’re not running with that? I
have not said that.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: You’re not resigning?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re still playing the hawk?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s much subtler than that. It’s nuanced.
I’m playing a much cleverer game than that. I’m a fake hawk.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fake hawk.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: You’re a fake hawk? You’re a fucking
idiot. You’re not a fake idiot are you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: We could just tell the press he’s going
anyway. Say he’s confirmed to us that he’s resigning.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I second that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What? You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Do we announce it before or after
the vote?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: During. Then he can’t do anything about
it.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Great. That’s decided then.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. No it’s bloody not. I’m - me. You’re not
me. I decide about all the main things about me, okay? Not you. Me.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: No. No Simon. I’m afraid not. Not on
this one. This is too big for you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Be realistic. You’re being used. We all are.
The one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign. Sacrifice
ourselves. That’s our only weapon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Like a suicide bomber?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: No, not like a suicide bomber. A
suicide bomber gets to make a decision.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Listen, I’m really sorry about Suzy and the
texting and …</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Good. Thanks. Do you have figures there for
CFE minimum requirements?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Er?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Conventional Forces in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure. I’ll just dig that out. Look it was a
very special evening for me and …</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Sorry? What? You’re mumbling.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I just wandered if tonight when all this shit
is over we couldn’t - you know. You’re single. I’m single now. You’re a
woman. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You want to have sex again?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s not a terrible idea is it? One more. For
the Gipper?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You know what a douchbag is Toby? You’re a
douchbag on fucking wheels.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Thanks. That was short and sweet. Well, short
and sour.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m thinking of becoming a suicide
bomber.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s certainly a very powerful way of
getting your point across.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Would you like a mint?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m okay thanks. Are you thinking to overdose
on mints? Because…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do you like me Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re my boss.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, but do you actually like me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sure. Look, I’ll leave you to your
thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I haven’t got any thoughts. I’m just staring
vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes
“oh shit” like a car alarm in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Not you. I know it wasn’t you, you’re too
fucking horny for your Knighthood.</p>
<p>****: Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Was what me?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Was it fucking you!? Answer the question!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She can’t very well answer the question if
you don’t tell her what it is, can she?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo,
this is between me and her. You leaked Liza Weld’s paper to the BBC.
Tell me you leaked it.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: I didn’t leak anything. I don’t know what
you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You’re lying. You touched your nose. That’s
what’s called a `tell’. You are lying.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: `No I’m not.’ That’s a tell as well. Classic.
I know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: This is what I’m doing to the machine. You
see? This is how angry I am with the piece of office equipment which
leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry I am with the person
who did it? Yeah? Can you Suzy?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was me.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Oh fuck off. Don’t come over all Spartacus
now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I leaked it.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Okay for a start turn that fucking row off.
It’s just fucking vowels. Listen to it. Just subsidised fucking foreign
vowels. You only listen to that shit because it’s bad form to actually
wear a big hat that says “I went to private school”.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Who did you leak it to?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I just sent it. I thought it was important
so I sent it through.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Ok. See this fax machine? That’s your career.
I’m pretty sure it’s fucked. Let me just check . Yeah, it is. Plus,
breach of Official Secrets, so that’s fucking swannee. Maybe you can get
a part time job in West End as a gentleman’s fluffer. Or whatever the
fuck they call it these days.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, you know – better to go out with a
bang…</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: No, no. I will not allow this to be a bang.
This will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being
fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine. And they do exist, `cos my
gran’s got one.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: So we’re down to the wire here, Mr Miracle
Worker, what have you got for me? What intel have you rustled us up?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Honestly? I haven’t got it. We need more
time.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: You haven’t got it? Can you delay the vote
to give you time to get it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No. I’ve had the vote brought forward.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Just getting my mints.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I am telling you to delay the vote and get
me some new intel. Now.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar Fucking
Hoover. I don’t work for you. You don’t tell me what to fucking do.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Well firstly, don’t raise your voice. This
is a sacred space. You may not believe that, I may not believe that, but
by God it’s a useful hypocrisy. And secondarily you do work for me. Your
prime minister instructed you to work for me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Get your Polos and fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your guys
has leaked a paper, you can’t do anything. We tell you to get intel, you
can’t do anything. I need the vote put back - you can’t do anything.
You, sir, are a useless piece of <code>S' star star</code>T’.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: We’ve just heard – the wall’s starting to
collapse. A brick has fallen. That’s the news I’m getting. More to
follow. Both news and bricks.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Why don’t you deal with that Tucker? A wall
is falling down, that’s more your level. I can see you with your shirt
off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You’ve been working for him?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s complicated, okay? I’ve been juggling
a number of responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Okay, well, right, after the vote, I
resign.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Look. It’s too late now. Resigning. It’s
not worth it. The horse has bolted. It’s out there getting shot now.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ll see you later, Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If you repeat this to anyone I will pull
your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken
shin bone. Now go away.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Suzy, how’s it going? Has Jamie been round?
Right…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: This is you, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: This is me, yes. And that’s you. I thought we
had this worked out.</p>
<p><strong>tob y</strong>: Sorry Suze I’ve got an incoming call, I’ll
ring back for a further bollocking.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ve got something big lined up and you better
not have fucked it up for me.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello? Oh hi, Paul. How’s it going? No, yes, I
know the wall is collapsing. I’m as frustrated as you are mate.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Look, could I call you back Paul? It’s just
the Vice President’s … I couldn’t? No, okay, let’s keep talking…</p>
<p><strong>int. foreign office - same time</strong>: 108 108</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra. I’ve got good
news. You’re not fired. That’s great news, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That sounds ominous.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: He’s fucking delighted. We want to put Liza
Weld’s Pwip Pip out there, properly. In the public domain. We just have
to refine it a bit.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Refine it?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Take out the cons, change the name of the
main informant.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s a complete fabrication.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Changing his name doesn’t make a difference.
The main source in there he’s not really called Ice Man, is he? “Mr and
Mrs Man, you’ve got a son, Ice.” So we change it, to another name. Who’s
the fuck with the fiddle? The Fiddlefuck.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is Debussy, if that’s what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Okay, we’ll call him Debussy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: And then you’ll make a couple of other
changes. It’ll mean your fingerprints are on it, Mikey, but it’s the
only way to save your job, you leaky fuck.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It wasn’t me, Jamie, alright? It wasn’t me.
Don’t make me do this. Someone else must have come in and used the fax
machine.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: What? Oh, that thing about your fax? Don’t
worry about that. I made that up. The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s
just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Come on Deuce Bigalow. You’re coming with
me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah, BBC newsdesk please. Malcolm Tucker.
Ben? Hi, how you doing? Yeah, well, I’m hearing you’re preparing a story
that we might not like.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I just want to say please, this garden wall
story, please don’t run with it. Simon Foster’s constituency-office
wall? You’ve got that haven’t you? I haven’t let the cat out of the bag?
Shit. Look, my reputation will be in tatters if you run with… And he’s
gone. Boo hoo. I’ve got a hard on.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Can we stop running because my hands are
really rather badly burned now.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I know it was you who leaked Linton’s War
Committee.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh? Right. It wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you telling me it wasn’t you? Is that
your proposition? Is that want you want to say if I ask them to fly you
to Diego Garcia and slip a hood over your head and carry out a cavity
search?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t actually recall. It was a busy
time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s more like it. So…you are now on
probation. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>mal colm</strong>: I am giving you a probationary period,
which will last from today…until the end of recorded time.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re my guy now. I own you now. You’re my
Kunte Kinte. Go and get your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ah, ambassador – with your big baldy head
you are spoiling us.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Good, I’ve been looking for you. I
needed to tell you that by a huge personal effort – huge –I have managed
to bring the vote forward by an hour and a half.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Great. I need it delayed now.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Very funny. That is funny.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: By an hour, at least. Although I guess two
and a half hours now, as you’ve brought it forward.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: No, I’m sorry I’m very sorry but I
won’t humiliate myself again.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You do what I say or you can go and see if
Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose, one
bollock, and a half-chewed cock.</p>
<p><strong>sir jonathan</strong>: Right. What can I say? ……</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: This is nice isn’t it? Cosy. Away from prying
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So what’s this, your political
wet-room?</p>
<p><strong>112 int. un corridor/tiny office - day 112</strong>: Toby is
standing in front of Malcolm, holding his laptop up for Malcolm to look
at and a physical copy of the red Pwip-Pip folder. He’s also got the
Pwip-Pip file on screen.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is it up, have you got it up?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Yeah it’s all fine.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, go to page nine, highlight that.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Go to page nine.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Highlight from that page to the end of the
document.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Do you mean select?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know I don’t use these things.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Select page nine to the end of the
document.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The caveats?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is it highlighted?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You mean selected, yeah it’s selected.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, right, standby … delete!</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Delete!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You can’t just delete the arguments against
the war.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Messenger! Get Messenger up!</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Oh hang on Malc. Michael’s stopped moving. I
think he’s crashed.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Have you tried hitting him? Give him a
thump, that usually works.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Hang on, I think I might be able to use
manual over-ride.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: No, it’s okay. It’s working again.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Great. Now attach that to email.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Attach that to an email.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right, let’s find a printer. The Japanese,
they’ll have one. They’ve got everything.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Get me a blue folder.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Where from?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t fucking know. Do I look like I’ve
ever set foot in a stationary cupboard? I do my shagging in five star
hotels. Now go and find me a blue fucking folder. Pronto.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The intelligence your guys couldn’t find? I
think you owe me a massive, grovelling apology.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: What, you did your job? Eventually?
Congratulations. Maybe they’ll give you a knighthood.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s been a pleasure working with you. You
know, I’ve met some psychos in my time, but none as fucking BORING as
you. Oh sorry, that’s right. You disapprove of swearing. A boring F star
star CUNT!</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Welcome aboard Liza. By the way,
congratulations on Pwip Pip. Excellent work.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t read it personally.
No time. But it certainly raised your profile.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No. That old thing? That was like a thousand
years ago. More maybe.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Terrific. So, I’ll keep this brief and to
the point. We go in, we make our case using the new British intelligence
from their source `Debussy’, we win the argument, we get the hell
out.</p>
<p><strong>chair</strong>: Resolution 5977 is passed.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yup. That’s that then.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: “That’s that then”? That’s your quote for the
ages is it?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: ’And I remember the moment war was declared. I
turned to the Minister and he said “That’s that, then. Anyone want a
mint?”.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Piss off, Toby.</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: We did it Bob!</p>
<p><strong>bob adriano</strong>: Yes sir! There were moments when it was
a little hairy …</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: No there weren’t, no.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Well done Michael. You did a good job. You
did a really, really good job.</p>
<p><strong>int. un office - day</strong>: 119 119</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So, I emailed my resignation ten minutes ago.
Yours should come right after the President’s announcement, to have the
biggest media impact.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I’ve been thinking Karen. This has
been the hardest fucking decision of my political life. I’m not
resigning.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What the fuck George. Seriously? You said
that the war was intolerable and we’d go together.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: It is - it is intolerable. I still
agree with myself about that. But I’ve got to tolerate it. My loyalty is
with the kids. At the end of the day I’m a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re not a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Look at the uniform, Karen. I’m not
a pastry chef. I have military commendations on my chest, not a little
fucking label saying My Name Is George.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re a politician. You live on canapes and
white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and
you scour the national papers for mentions of your name. You’re a
fucking politician.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I’m still a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: When was the last time you shot a guy?</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: What, if I haven’t shot a guy in 15
years then I’m not a soldier? City hall don’t insist I bring along a
fucking bullet- ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier
licence.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know this is an unnecessary war. It’s a
war you don’t believe in. Show me some balls, George.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: I know I’ve got balls, I don’t need
to show them to you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh sure, It just so happens they’re sitting
pretty in a pair of Egyptian cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a Government
salary.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Don’t talk about my fucking balls
that way. My balls have been around. My balls have got balls.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come on Chad, let’s leave the General and his
over-stuffed scrotum. We’re going to draft our resignation
announcements.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Er, I might, stay with the General actually
Karen, if that’s okay? If he’s staying I might stay with him and see
what assistance I can furnish.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay. General Shrek and his faithful talking
donkey.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: This takes balls Karen.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You’ve got balls Sir. Anyone can see you’ve
got big balls. They’re two-thirds of a snowman.</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Okay. This was not the plan.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, you’re right. I am a piss-brain. That’s
the perfect word, Mr Michaelson. Your mother came up with it? Well
congratulate her from me. I am a piss- brain for letting this
happen.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Simon, look, mate. Listen to me. You still
don’t need to resign.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. I’m going to resign, Malcolm. In a hour.
You can’t stop me now.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Boss?</p>
<p><strong>simon malcolm</strong>: Yes? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s on the BBC News website – Partial
collapse of the wall. Mrs Michaelson’s greenhouse has a smashed pane.
The BBC had a crew down there.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: God, and that’s NEWS. Ridiculous, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s nor Ridiculous. You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The wall. It’s just not tolerable.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s just a fucking wall.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Look at this. Give me the paper. He’s my
new boy. I’m just breaking him in.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The Telegraph has a cartoon of you crushed
underneath the Great Wall Of China, suggesting you are the only
political fuck-up visible from space. Look at this. No one could survive
this. The PM is very clear on this - you’re sacked, over the wall.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You haven’t even - spoken to the Prime
Minister.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes I have.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You fucking haven’t I’ve been right here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I have spoken to the Prime Minister.
Whether it has happened or not is irrelevant. It is true. As soon as I
heard about the wall, I spoke to him and he decided you had to go.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m not going quietly.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah well if you try to turn this into some
anti-war protest, you can expect your `mountain of conflict’ soundbite
to be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance mix on YouTube. I
will marshall all the forces of media darkness to hound you to an
assisted suicide.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right, Rumpleforeskin’s give me your
laptop, so – shall we draft your `Dear Prime Minister, just a quick note
to say thanks for sacking me’ letter?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi. General? Look I realise this is a slightly
strange time to say this, but I just want to say how much I admire…</p>
<p><strong>general miller</strong>: Go fuck yoursefl, Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great. Lovely</p>
<p><strong>int. state department. day</strong>: 121 121</p>
<p><strong>linton</strong>: Okay, I don’t want to be accused of micro
managing but I personally do not see that
<code>I heart Huckabees' should be on the list of dvds suitable for forces entertainment. That self-indulgent crap is not suitable entertainment for combat troops. And where's</code>United
93’ on here? That should be playing 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>int. constituency office. day.</strong>: 122 122</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Right, I’ve got a selection of quotes for you,
they’re all local firms and none of them is very well respected. Now,
this sceptic tank is also rearing it’s pooy head again too.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Well Alan, I have been balled out by Linton
for allowing I Heart Huckabees on to the troops DVD roster. You know the
phrase, “I’m too old for this shit? Well, I’m too young for this
shit.</p>
<p>****: Page 122</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: I should be out there having a youth. Getting
high, making women pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ah, here they are. Minister. Elizabeth.
Welcome aboard.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Thanks Malcolm. Looking forward to it. War
seems to be going `great guns’ at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ah, cheeky! Let me take you out for an
expensive lunch, roast swan and all the trimmings, and I’ll bring you up
to speed on the whole Middle East situation.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Are you twisting my arm already?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way.
Watch your step there. There’s still blood on the deck.</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: Hi I’m Danny. Dan. I’m Elizabeth’s chief
advisor.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Judy Molloy. Senior Press -</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: Have I got a desk?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes, it’s that one there.</p>
