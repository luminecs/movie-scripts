<p><strong>never been kissed</strong>: Revised Draft by Jenny Bicks
Based on the Original Screenplay by Abby Kohn &amp; Marc Silverstein
6/26/98 revision</p>
<p><strong>close up on a girl’s face</strong>: It’s Josie Geller, 25,
cute, blonde and scared out of her wits. We hear the chanting of a
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Josie! Josie! Josie!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You know in some movies how they have a dream
sequence only they don’t tell you it’s a dream? Pull out to reveal Josie
on pitcher’s mound of a–</p>
<p><strong>exterior. a baseball stadium – night</strong>: It’s packed.
Reporters line the field. All eyes are on Josie.</p>
<p>****: This is so not a dream. The stadium clock sets at 5:00. The
crowd goes crazy. Josie takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, “Oh
God.”</p>
<p><strong>interior. electronics store – continuous</strong>: Multiple
images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered.</p>
<p>****: It wasn’t supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my
job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball stadium – continuous</strong>: The clock
starts to tick down. The crowd yells again.</p>
<p>****: Trust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this.
I mean, two months ago you couldn’t have picked me out of a crowd…</p>
<p><strong>interior. chicago sun times bullpen – day</strong>: Packed
with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Told you. I’m over there. The camera swings
to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and
paper in hand.</p>
<p><strong>rhoda</strong>: Theater–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Standard American calls for “er”. Standard
British is “re”. So go for “er”, unless you’re a pompous American, then
go for British. Josie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her
wake.</p>
<p><strong>rhoda</strong>: No. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to
go, remember? Josie stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office
assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he
talks, ignoring Josie.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: No way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on.
What.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Messages? Merkin removes his finger from his
nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie.
Disgusted, she takes it by one corner.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: Seriously? No way. No way– Josie’s still
standing there.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: What</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Merkin, do you think we could get some more
yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we’re– Merkin swivels his
chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone
call.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: Okay, I’m back, so– Josie sighs, walks to
her door. It’s marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy
Editor. She adjusts the plate so it’s perfectly straight.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s office – continuous</strong>: Josie enters,
reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into
the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door,
takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her
pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles,
satisfied, ready for another day. Anita Brandt, late 20’s, pretty in a
semi-unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Guess who I did it with last night…</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Roger in Op/Ed.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Who told!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, “I
have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I’m going to do it with
him.”</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Well, that doesn’t mean it was going to
happen for sure. Josie just stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Once it didn’t happen for sure. Gus Strauss,
late 30’s, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy
onto Josie’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Computer’s down. Septuplets story. I need it
back by five. Hopefully the copy’s not a mess.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It is hoped that it’s not a mess. “Hopefully”
is an adverb. It means “with hope”. You have it defining the copy, and
I’m pretty sure the copy doesn’t have feelings. Gus and Anita just stare
at Josie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, excuse me for caring about words.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Oh, man! Who told?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Roger in Op/Ed. Don’t make me send you another
memo about my policy on inter-office dating.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Intra office. And they’re not dating. They’re
having sex.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: And what is your policy? That if you’re not
getting any, no one can? Anita flounces off.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How many times have I fired her?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Five– Six–</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Eh. Gus turns to exit.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey Gus–did you see the story idea I left on
your desk?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah–the blind foster home mother. It was good.
I got Cahoon on it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he’s–good.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller, we’ve been over this. You’re a great
copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You’re not a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You’ve done five of my ideas.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You know what separates us office flunkies from
the reporters?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: They don’t have to be in the office Christmas
show?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: A flack jacket.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: A–flack jacket.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write.
But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He’s
aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You don’t think I can grab bulls’ balls?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller, you don’t want a reporter’s life.
They’re very–messy. You’re all about order. Control. And getting me my
copy by five.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey–I can be out of control. Gus smiles. On
his way out he re-adjusts Josie’s nameplate so it hangs at an angle.
Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can’t take it, and runs to the door
and straightens it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Copy by five.</p>
<p><strong>interior. sun times lunchroom – day</strong>: Actually, a
pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch–Anita eats
Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut
food in front of her.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Be honest. Do you think I’m aggressive? Anita
ponders a moment.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Okay. Remember when they took your office
chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: You stood for like a month. Cynthia, an
affable African-American woman in her 40’s, enters and puts three
microwave meals in the microwave.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Just because I’m not out of control doesn’t
mean I can’t write.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Josie, you listen to me. If you feel you’re
a writer– Here, deep inside, don’t let anyone tell you you’re not. Look
at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into
what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You write obituaries.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Hey, if you can make a busted aorta sound
good–honey, that’s art. The microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the
three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Cynthia, aren’t they only diatetic if you eat
them one at a time?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I eat ’em one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Y’know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn’t
kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger’s got a friend, Marshall in
editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time
you went on a real live date?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m concentrating on my career right now.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes?
Anything?!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Anita!</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Look. You’re way under 30, you’re cute, some
guys find white Carter’s underwear sexy� If you talk to his nose, you
don’t even notice the eye. Josie laughs in spite of herself.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: The right guy is out there. I’m just not
going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be
a fun diversion.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: When I finally get kissed, I’ll know. Anita
and Cynthia trade looks.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Okay. If you’ve never kissed a guy, we got
bigger problems than the underwear.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’ve kissed guys. I’ve just never kissed a
guy. Felt that thing–</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: “That thing”? Is that what you kids are
calling it these days?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That thing. That moment. You kiss someone and
it’s like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus
is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person
you’re meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one
moment you’ve been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry
at the same time because you’re so lucky you found it, and so scared
that it will all go away. Anita and Cynthia take this in.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Damn, girl. You are a writer.</p>
<p><strong>interior. tiki post – day</strong>: Basically a Mailbox Etc.
store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold
Fedex envelopes. Rob Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with “Tiki
Post” emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the
cash register. Monty Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The
place is empty.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hey Monty–you think we’ll get any business
today?</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: I’m handing out a free lei to every customer!
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki
torches.</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a
little something about the mail business. I’ve been in it over thirty
years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that’s changed is the
Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things
up!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I thought people just wanted their mail
delivered on time. Josie walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian
music. Monty puts a lei over her head.</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: Aloha! Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Relax, Monty. It’s just my sister. Monty takes
the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through
the cash inside.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Thanks, Jos. I’ll pay you back. Bambi thanks
you, too. Rob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked
outside.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That is so–weird that you name your car.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No it’s not. Guys name their penises.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Okaaaay…. That car’s going to bankrupt
you.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: She just needs a new windshield wiper.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Because I bought the windshield last week.
I’m a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do. Rob hands the
money back.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Y’know what? Take it. I don’t want it. Josie
hands it back.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob, take the money, okay? It’s no big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, it is. It’s just one more thing to add to
your “things that make you a better person than me” list.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Better person than I.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: See!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I know this woman. She works in admissions at
Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall
semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could
help and–</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I’m not going to college, Jos. And I’m not
playing anymore baseball. This is my life.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: This–this is a luau that sells packing
material!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Someday this luau is going to be all mine!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How can you just give up like that? You had a
real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop
everything. Don’t you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad’s? Pay your
own bills?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as
you!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: For your information, I am very happy.
Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life! She exits. The music starts
up again.</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: Come again!</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment – night</strong>: We pan around
the neatest and quietest walk-up you’ve ever seen. Lots of books on
shelves. We find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing
touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says:
“LOVE”. She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her
two turtles.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: There. What d’you think, guys? Where should
it go? Josie looks around the living room.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hmm. What’s that? Bedroom? Great idea! She
walks into the bedroom with the pillow.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s bedroom – continuous</strong>: A perfectly
arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely
covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of
the others and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>interior. a conference room - same</strong>: It’s packed with
the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of
the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to
Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30’s.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Let me start out by saying that I was very
impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our
supermarkets. An older man, Dutton, smiles proudly.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: But since the Trib did a better piece on
the same subject, you’re fired. Dutton’s face falls. Everyone looks
horrified.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: You heard me. Out. Out. Dutton shuffles
out. Josie takes a big bite of donut.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: So. Happy March everybody!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Happy March Mr. Rigfort.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: To celebrate, I’ve decided it’s time for
another undercover feature! Everyone looks underwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: You all know that some of my best
inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched
foray into hair plugs would lead to last month’s award-winning expose –
“hair today, gone tomorrow”? Hat’s off to you, Bruns. We pan over to
Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods
sadly.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Or should I say “hat’s on”! And what about
when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard
went undercover as an expert slalom skier. Howard smiled wanly. Both his
arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking
out different reporters.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: So last night I’m sitting around the dinner
table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we’re
eating chicken with this peanut sauce. Camera stops at a Chef Boyardee
look-alike.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Undercover chef. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Hang on, Gus. So, we’re eating this peanut
sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking. Camera stops at a
Nurse Ratchet look-alike.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I’m smelling undercover ER nurse.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Turns out he’s allergic to peanuts. And I
think – holy shit. I don’t even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if
they’re even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about
kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to
peanuts? Boom. It hit me – “My Semester In High School.” Camera stops at
a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: You. What’s your name.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Josie. Josie Geller.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: You enroll on Friday. General crowd hubub.
Josie’s in shock.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. But–I’m not a reporter yet…</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: And none of these geezers could pass for a
day under 40. Have fun. And Rigfort exits.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s office - minutes later</strong>: Josie is
so excited she can hardly speak to Anita.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s finally happening, Anita! I’m going to
write! Anita looks concerned.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: My own undercover feature - “Written by Josie
Geller”.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Jos - Maybe you should turn it down. A beat.
Josie’s face falls.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You don’t think I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: No - It’s just a lot of pressure for your
first piece, that’s all. I mean, it’s not a half-page article, it’s a
major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that
guy’s his cousin! Gus enters.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll straighten all this out.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: But I don’t want it straightened out.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller, this is way out of your league. Josie
takes in Anita and Gus.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Okay, just so I’m clear here – neither of you
think I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Jos, that’s not what we’re –</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in
the mailroom and you didn’t think you could learn Spanish fast enough,
who quizzed you on your verbs? Anita looks down, chastened.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Senorita Josie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who
showed you how to hold the needles?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: You knit?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: So, this is my chance. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m not holding your job for you, Geller. Josie
jumps up and down and hugs Gus, who is clearly uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Don’t make me send you the memo on hugging in
the workplace. Josie smiles. Gus exits.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need,
I’ll help you out. Josie sits, motions to the brown paper bag.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You can start by handing me that bag. Anita
does. Josie sticks it over her face, flips her head between her knees
and starts hyperventilating again. Close up on Rob, wearing his Tiki
Post outfit. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No. Uh, uh. Pull out to reveal him standing
with Josie on the sidewalk in front of -</p>
<p><strong>exterior. tiki post - day</strong>: Josie’s shiny Buick is
parked right behind Bambi at the curb.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s just for a couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You can’t just “borrow” my car for a couple of
months! That’s like ten years in Bambi life!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’ll give you my Buick Le Sabre. Rob rolls
his eyes and enters the store.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You can name it whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>interior. tiki post - continuous</strong>: Josie follows Rob
into the store. He turns.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Wow. This must be big.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I got an assignment from the paper. I’m going
undercover. Back to high school. Rob starts laughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Do you remember high school?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It was a long time ago -</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Don’t you remember what they called you? Slowly
Josie’s face falls. She looks very far away.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Josie -</p>
<p><strong>interior. a high school cafeteria - day</strong>: It’s packed
with kids. Everyone stares off-screen at chants -</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie. Josie
Grossie.</p>
<p><strong>interior. tiki post - same</strong>: Josie looks
stricken.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Josie Grossie.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I know. I came up with it. You look
nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God. She puts
her hand over her mouth, races for the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>interior. tiki post bathroom - minutes later</strong>: Josie
has just gotten violently ill. She rises off her knees, grabs some
toilet paper to wipe her mouth. She looks down at her feet.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school corridor - day</strong>: We close up on
brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage JOSIE braces, heavy
glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking down the corridor with a huge
backpack on her back. A boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of
her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk Sprite into her
backback. Kids smile and snicker as Josie continues down the hallway.
She spots, Billy Prince, ultmate high school heartthrob, and approaches
him nervously.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey, Billy Prince, I noticed you weren’t in
math today, and I have the notes in case you want - Midway through
Josie’s speech, we hear the odd sound of liquid hitting linoleum. Josie
follow Billy’s gaze down to between her feet where a pool of Sprite has
gathered. Billy starts to laugh. Kids around him join in. As the
laughter echoes around her we DISSOLVE BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>interior. tiki post bathroom - same</strong>: Josie stares
into the mirror. Staring back is teenage Josie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: This is a very bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the mall - teen clothing store - day</strong>:
Anita and Josie cruise through a teen clothing store, carrying large
bags from a stationery store. Josie picks up a platform sneaker and just
stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: So, you were a geek. Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Anita, remember espadrilles?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Please. That doesn’t make you a nerd.
Everyone wore those shoes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: The girls threw them at me in the locker
room.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Okay. That’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: At the end of the yeat the person who got the
most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once
doesn’t mean it’s going to happen again. That’s why you have me for
fashion consultation. Anita pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it
up.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Now this is cute.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That is lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: So I was thinking about what you were saying
- y’know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What’d you feel when you kissed him?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Bridgework?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Very romantic. Josie pulls out a plain
button-down cardigan.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How about this?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I am not letting you out of the house in
that, young lady. Anita grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching
earrings and holds them up.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Cuuuute!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: ’Nita, this is about reporting, not
accessorizing.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: And we’re going to have to do something about
your hair.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Anita!</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay?
How many of us get to go back to high school? You’re gonna have a
blast!</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to: close up - an alarm clock</strong>: on a
bedside table. Surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair color, a stack of
index cards, ripped magazine pages of teen looks, issues of Teen Beat
and YM. The clock slips to 7:00. NPR starts playing. A hand reaches
over, hits the radio off. SOUND EFFECTS: A school bell. As the bell
continues to ring, we widen to:</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s bedroom - morning</strong>: Josie sits up
in bed, covers pulled up to her chin in terror.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. a chicago street - morning</strong>: MUSIC UP:
“Morning Train”. Crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto
the stairs leading up to the El. A big yellow car jerks into frame,
backfires noisily. It’s Josie at the wheel of Bambi. She jerks out of
frame.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. south glen south high schoool - morning</strong>: A
suburban campus anchored by a main building. Cars pull into the parking
lot for the beginning of the day. Kids greet each other, converge on the
front doors of the school. General mayhem. Bambi pulls in. She jerks
into a spot, backfiring once more for effect. The entire scene stops.
Kids freeze, look at Josie. A beat, and they they continue on their
way.</p>
<p><strong>interior. bambi - continuous</strong>: Josie takes a few deep
breaths.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Okay, I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do
this.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. parking lot - continuous</strong>: Josie steps out
of the car wearing the maribou jacket, earrings, and white jeans. She
shuts the door behing her, starts walking. She has unknowingly shut her
jacket in the door and as she walks, a piece of maribou rips, trailing
behind her like a tail.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, okay. Feeling good…</p>
<p><strong>interior. school lobby - same</strong>: Josie merges with the
throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby. She stares
around, overwhelmed. “Go Rams!” banners share space with signs that
read: “63 DAYS TIL PROM!” She inches her way along the wall until she is
stopped by a guard who grabs her arm.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey–where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh, I’m a student. Most definitely a student.
In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students. Hi.
Hi there. The guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them,
to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through. Josie
smiles, “whoops,” walks back.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>interior. school lobby - minutes later</strong>: Josie’s
stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell phone, laptop, mini
tape recorder, electronic organizer, pager, being scrutinized by the
guard. Josie’s sure she’s been found out. Camera widens. Down from
Josie, we see other kids’ belongings spread out. They have the identical
high-tech equipment. The guard picks up Josie’s nail file, examines it
-</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Weapon. And throws it in the trash.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - morning</strong>: Josie
stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, totally lost. She
approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi–um, I’m looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox? As
soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth - a
tongue pierce. Josie does too. We zoom in on that shiny little metal
ball. Josie is fixated. So fixated that we stop hearing the boy’s voice.
All we see is the mouth - and that ball - moving. The mouth closes. He’s
done. Josie’s face is contorted in imagined pain.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Ow. I mean, wow. Wow. Great directions.
Clear. Concise. And Josie takes off, totally embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - morning</strong>: Josie walks
up to Room 204. Opening the door, she’s met by a sea of faces. Ms. Knox,
mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the front of the class.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Hi - hello. Wilkommen. Entre. Josie walks
in. Kids whisper and snicker.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Yes, well, I’m sorry I forgot to take my
hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es
su casa. Josie makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. The class
titters. She sits in front of two girls, Kirsten and Kristen, beautiful
and intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: That is so sad –</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I know, like five chickens had to die just
so she could look that stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Josie, in my classroom, tardiness is
unacceptable –</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m really sorry – Ms. Knox pulls a
ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk. The class laughs in
recognition.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Not as sorry as I am. Ms. Knox puts the
sombrero on a less-than-thrilled Josie.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Ole! Ten minutes in this hat, you’ll never
be late again. So, let’s hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up.
Josie does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can
read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard –it’s filled with precise
script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards
face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins –</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: My name is Josie. I’m a high school student.
I came from – Just then the classroom door opens. We see from Josie’s
perspective a blinding light, Josie squints. From the light emerges a
shadowy vision of Billy Prince.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Billy? Josie blinks, REVEAL not Billy, but a
beautiful guy, Guy. He stands very close to her.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Bali. I’m from Billy-Bali. It’s a suburb of
Bali proper. Guy pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to Ms. Knox,
and moves to his seat.</p>
<p><strong>ms. knox</strong>: Bali. Fascinating! What did your family do
there? Josie looks around in panic, sees a student in a South Glen South
windbreaker with huge ram on the back.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: We were–sheep–farmers. We raised sheep. In
Billy-Bali. Josie realizes the trouble she’s gotten herself into.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God–do I miss Billy-Bali. It
had–a really great…aquarium. She sits. Defeated.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - later</strong>: Josie rushes
down the hall, still toting her enormous bag. A huge banner - SOUTH
GLEN, OUR NATION’S BEST PROM - hangs prominently. She talks covertly
into a hand-held tape recorder.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Note to self–Research Bali. Kill Anita for
picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero.</p>
<p><strong>interior. classroom - same</strong>: Josie and her enormous
bookbag enter. She takes a seat toward the back of the room. Kristen,
Kirsten and GIBBY, another beauty, enter and head to the back of the
room. Kirsten and Gibby stand over Josie, staring at her.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: We sit here.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. Sorry–I didn’t know these were
assigned.</p>
<p><strong>gibby:</strong>: They’re not. Josie quickly gathers her
things and moves one row forward, next to two empty seats. TWO STONERS
shuffle over to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>stoner 1</strong>: Sorry. We sit here.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Couldn’t you two–sit there?</p>
<p><strong>stoner 2</strong>: Right. Except there are three of us– The
Stoners eye each other, then the two seats. A look of horror comes over
Stoner 1. STONER 1 Dude–we left Jed at the 7-11! Again! Josie picks up
her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in the room-in the front row,
surrounded by “Denominators” who all wear orange Denominator
sweatshirts. Sitting next to Josie is ALDYS, a Denominator–intense,
wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. She smiles at
Josie. Josie smiles back and looks up as MR. COULSON enters the room.
He’s a ruggedly handsome twenty-something Yale grad. He grabs a notebook
out of his bag, goes around to sit on the front of his desk, sipping
coffee from a Styrofoam cup.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hi, everyone. I don t think we’ve met. I’m Sam
Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not
letting you guys call me Sam.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m Josie. Geller. I think the school would
probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie. Sam
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Josie since you’re new–I love to drink my
coffee during class, and since I allow myself to do this, I allow
everyone to bring beverages to class as well. welcome to Shakespeare’s
“As You Like It.” Okay. How many of you actually read the assignment
last night? About five hands go up. SAM Not bad. Now how many of you
spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods? Twenty hands.
Sam laughs. SAM Man. If I could just get you guys to read while you eat.
Sam opens his book. Aldys notices Josie has no book. She moves next to
her.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Here. We can share. They share a smile.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: ’As You Like It” is an example of a
Shakespearean– Sam turns to the blackboard and starts writing. We CU on
his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all the girls
swoon. SAM Pastoral Comedy. Anyone know what that means? An
enthusiastic, if slightly dim girl, SERA, waves her hand.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Oh oh oh! That’s what they do to milk!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same
letter– –three syllables–</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Parakeet?!</p>
<p><strong>aldys:</strong>: There’s a minute of my life I’ll never get
back. Josie smiles at this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay, anyone else— Josie can’t contain
herself.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Pastoral means set in the country. Originally
seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It’s from the Latin pascere. To graze.
Student bleets like a sheep O.S. Sam just stares at her, smiling.
Finally, he walks over and shakes her hand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did I mention to the class that I love our new
student? Josie beams.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Did I mention that the class also loves our
new kiss ass? Josie’s smile quickly fades.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gibby, that’s not exactly the kind of
participation I’m looking for. Gibby looks right at Josie.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Ooops. Sorry. Josie just sits there, face
burning.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - later</strong>: Josie
approaches her locker. She can’t get to it because a COUPLE is busy
making out against it. A GIRL’S VOICE comes over the loudspeaker. She’s
completely ignored.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Hi. This is Sydney, Student Body
President! Okay, first. Bad news-The’ district didn’t allocate enough
funds, so as of this afternoon, there will be no music department. Now,
about Prom– The entire hallway FREEZES. The couple breaks their clinch
and looks up. SILENCE. Josie is amazed.</p>
<p><strong>sydney�s voice</strong>: Voting on Prom theme has been
completed. And the theme is– CU on expectant FACES.</p>
<p><strong>sydney�s voice</strong>: The Millennium! PANDEMONIUM. Kids
cheer, gasp. One GIRL faints. The crowd surges again. Josie, caught in
the flow, doesn’t notice a locker door flinging open. She smashes her
face right into it. Everyone, including Guy, turns and laughs. Even some
Denominators.</p>
<p><strong>cu: a cafeteria tray</strong>: Moves down the food line. It’s
piled with unidentifiable foods and three glasses of fluorescent red
punch. Hands pull the tray out of the frame. INTO FRAME comes another
tray, this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting with three
celery sticks on a plate. WIDEN TO REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>interior. cafeteria - day</strong>: Josie, pulling the
perfect tray down the cafeteria line. She reaches some awful-looking
Cole slaw in a big vat. A CAFETERIA GUY in a plastic cap hovers above
it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Excuse me. What’s in the Cole slaw? The
cafeteria guy hauls an industrial-size plastic tub onto the, counter and
turns it-so Josie can read the label: “KOLE SLAW FOOD.” Josie wrinkles
her nose. She moves on to the cash register.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: That’ll be twelve ninety-five.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh my gosh. Wow. That’s… pricey.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: That’s real meat in the ham sandwich. Josie
turns to a GIRL in line behind her.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Boy–that’s a lot of bread for that bread! The
Girl rolls her eyes, reaches past Josie to grab a mustard bottle. Josie
turns with her tray toward the room.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: INTERIOR. CAFETERIA - DAY 4 KIDS stare at
CAMERA and chant:</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Josie Grossie–Josie Grossie–Josie Grossie.
ANGLE BACK ON JOSIE. She’s seventeen. Standing with her tray, paralyzed.
The CAMERA SPINS, showing us her back. There, tattooed in squeeze-bottle
mustard, is “GROSSIE.” A boy stands behind her victoriously holding the
mustard bottle.</p>
<p><strong>interior. cafeteria - same</strong>: Josie shakes off the
vision and stares out at the crowded cafeteria. She sees Kirsten,
Kristen and Gibby, steels herself, and decides to approach. Kirsten is
eating a bran muffin.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat
grams.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Nah uh.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Yeah, I read this thing that one bran muffin
can be like two bran muffins sometimes. Kirsten pushes the muffin
away.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: God. Food is so confusing.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi Kristen.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: It’s Kirsten. Josie plops herself down with
these girls, and takes a spiral pad out of her big knapsack. In the
process, she manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white
jeans.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’ll teach me to wear white after Labor
Day.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Umm- I don’t think you’re supposed to wear
white jeans after 1983. They all laugh. Josie fakes a laugh, too.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Right, right. Josie picks up her notepad and
her pen.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: So - tell me about yourselves. They all just
stare at Josie in disgust. Guy approaches their table.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m Guy. Guy looks at Josie. He’s beautiful.
She’s flustered.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my.
Look at that–I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Are you in special ed? Josie stands up, grabs
her bag and her chocolate milk-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Bye. Guy. Others. She leaves the Cafeteria,
passing a-couple of Denominators.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Aaaah! How old am I?</p>
<p><strong>denominator #1</strong>: Approximately six thousand three
hundred and fifty days old- subject to adjustment for month of birth.
This is very funny Denominator humor- to the Denominators. Josie leaves
the Cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. school grounds - continuous</strong>: Josie runs
out an exit door and right into a SECURITY GUARD</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got a pass?</p>
<p><strong>interior. gym - later</strong>: A banner above reads
“PRESIDENTIAL FITNESS TESTING THIS WEEK.” FIFTEEN SENIOR GIRLS,
including Josie, in matching green and yellow polyester gym clothes do
sprints up and-down the basketball court. Josie looks like she’s about
to die. Ms. Brown yells as she passes.</p>
<p><strong>ms. brown</strong>: move it Geller! Move it! Move it! Josie
stops, grabs the woman by the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Must–have–water–</p>
<p><strong>ms. brown</strong>: What do I look like, your waitress? Now
you’re gonna complete these sprints, cause if you don’t you fail. And if
you fail gym, you’re NEVER GETTING INTO COLLEGE!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh–my–God–you guys are�still telling that
lie–?</p>
<p><strong>ms. brown</strong>: That’s it Geller–drop and give me twenty!
Josie drops to the gym floor.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - later</strong>: It’s -
finally- the end of the day. Josie makes her way down the hall,
clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed and shoved by kids as they
storm outside. A huge banner hangs overhead reading: “SIGN UP FOR SENIOR
NIGHT!” She tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her. She
makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we see, as she shoves
her pad of paper into her bag, it is completely blank.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. parking lot - same</strong>: Kids fill the parking
lot. Josie walks, talking on her cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rhoda, make sure Gus gets-the whole message,
okay? Yeah–bye– Josie arrives where she parked Bambi. The space is
empty. She still holds the phone to her ear–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wait a second– No, not you–bye– Josie shuts
the phone, looks around…retraces her steps … Bambi is gone. Josie walks
around the lot, getting visibly upset. In the corner of the lot, we see
a group of Denominators removing a BIG METAL CHAIN from around a group
of tightly packed cars.</p>
<p>****: They do it to all the new kids. Josie finds Aldys standing next
to her.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Who’s of they? Aldys motions up to a second
floor window. Guy and his Group look down on them, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They
push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for
it. We’ve taken to chaining ours together for safety. I’m Aldys.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: When it’s not yours. My mom was going through
her Harlequin Romance phase.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Try being named after a guitar-playing
pussycat. Aldys doesn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Never mind. That is so awful that they hide
your cars.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: I guess. Although, what is truly awful is
that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room
right now- She points up to the biology room-</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: They still would not know the difference
between a synecdoche and a hyperbole. Josie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I know. It’s pathetic. Aldys stares Josie
down.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Well, do you?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole-
as in ” head of cattle”, whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like
“I could eat a horse.”</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Nice. They stop and look around.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How long will they watch us for?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched
me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why do they listen to Guy?</p>
<p><strong>aldys:</strong>: Because he’s Guy Perkins. Listen, you want
to walk to Na-Na’s and get something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah. Let’s do that. They start to walk out
of the parking lot. Josie is visibly thrilled - having finally found a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>interior. na-na’s - later</strong>: Josie and Aldys share a
huge plate of chili fries.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Yeah - isn’t it amazing that those guys are
our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh I know. A WAITER delivers two huge
chocolate shakes.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: I’m going to be so happy to get to college. I
hear at Northwestern they don’t make fun of you for knowing the element
table.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey–I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the
bathroom. OUT THE WINDOW, Josie sees her Buick with Rob at the wheel
stopped at a red light. Detailed on to the side in big white script is:
“THE TIKI POST”. Josie’s eyes widen. The light changes. Rob pulls
away.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. My. God. You’ll really like Northwestern.
They both slurp down their shakes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do
you want to be?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Professor of medieval literature. Novelist.
Weekend flautist. Aldys takes another slurp of her shake. WE HEAR a
muffled cell phone RINGING.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: I think your knapsack is ringing. Josie takes
the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - same</strong>: Gus speaks into his
phone, knitting frantically.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller, I got your message. What the hell kind
of story are you pitching?! Josie smiles awkwardly at Aldys, covering
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you
too.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You’re a sick puppy, Geller. Josie indicates to
Aldys she’ll be right back and walks to the back of the restaurant by
the pay phones.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s an expose on cafeteria food.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: And you’re leading with the terrible truth
about cole slaw?!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, the bulk of it will be about the
pimento loaf–</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller…you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at
what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So
unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex
with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Gus slams down his phone.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You didn’t taste the pimento loaf. She looks
back to the table where Aldys is dividing the check.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. track - high school - dusk</strong>: In the middle
of the track is Josie’s car. The MARCHING BAND clumsily practices their
formations around it. Josie and Aldys arrive at the car and Aldys pops
the hood.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: They love to disconnect the battery, too. She
looks under the hood, reconnects the battery. Slams the hood down.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Just so you know, I think they recalled these
cars in 1974.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Sure. No problem. Aldys heads to the lot for
her car, and then turns around.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Petty good.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: How would you like to join The Denominators?
The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm
guy last year.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: College?</p>
<p><strong>nasa.</strong>: Plus we have these really fun pizza study
groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you
need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we
could offer you a certain amount of protection”, if you know what I
mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other. Josie
smiles. MUSIC UP: SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK’S “Magic Three”</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - day</strong>: Josie and
Denominators walk down the hallway in unison, past Guy’s Group, open
their lockers in order a la “RESERVOIR DOGS”, take out paper, pencils,

<p><strong>interior. - high school hallway - day</strong>: Josie and
Aldys, both wearing big orange Denominator sweatshirts, are behind a
table manning a bake sale. A banner behind them says: n =
3.14578697786978 Pie = $.75 No one is stopping to buy anything. Josie
points to the left, Aldys looks, and Josie stuffs a whole brownie in her
mouth. They laugh uncontrollably as Josie starts to choke and cough up
most of the brownie. We pan down a row of nervous looking Denominator
faces as they watch Josie, sitting head to head against a DIGIT, an
opposing Math-a-lon competitor. They both work furiously on a problem. A
judge sits between them. A makeshift scoreboard hanging off the desk
shows the score is tied. Josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the
judge her card. He looks it over, and gives her team five points. They
win. The Denominators erupt into cheers. They’re jumping all over Josie,
going crazy. As we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty, except for
a handful of Denominators going crazy on one side, and a janitor
sweeping up on the other.</p>
<p><strong>interior. mall book store - day</strong>: Smiling at each
other, Josie and Aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line. WE
WIDEN to reveal they’re in line with NERDY ADULTS also clutching their
books. At the head of the line is a blow-up poster for The New Elements
Of Grammar. An OLD MAN signs books for his fans.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment - night</strong>: It’s late.
Josie is typing on her laptop, referencing notes from her notebook.
Schoolbooks and homework are spread around her.</p>
<p><strong>interior. classroom - day</strong>: Sam is perched on the
desk. The usual players in their usual seats. Aldys is standing and
reading from her book.</p>
<p><strong>aldys:</strong>: “All the world’s a stage and all the men and
women merely players.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Anyone have any idea what Shakespeare meant by
that? No one answers. SAM Anyone? Sera … Megan … exchange student who
doesn’t speak English? We CU on the students, ending on an Asian boy who
smiles wildly at Sam and waves. Sam smiles, and waves back. SAM It’s
about disguise, playing a part. It’s the theme of “As You Like It.” Can
anyone tell me where we see that?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Well, Rosalind disguises herself as a man and
escapes into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Right. And it’s when she’s in costume that she
can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare’s making the
point here that when we’re disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we
wouldn’t do in ordinary life. CU on Josie’s face. She’s clearly
uncomfortable. Sam walks up to a huge football player, BRETT. SAM Brett
when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: We win?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You hit people. You yell. You touch other guys’
butts. The class giggles. Brett looks horrified.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But it’s okay, because you’re in uniform.
Disguise changes the rules I had these Spiderman pyjamas. I thought when
I wore them, that I had super powers. One night I tried to walk up the
side of the garage.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Did you make it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: To the Emergency Room. Yeah. Josie smiles at
this, a little smitten. SAM Josie, why don’t you read from Act 5, Scene
2, Rosalind’s speech– Josie stands up, starts reading–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: “No sooner had they met but they looked; no
sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed…” Josie’s
voice begins to fade away-</p>
<p><strong>interior. classroom - day</strong>: ANGLE BACK to Josie, now
seventeen and mortified, nervously standing in class and reading a poem.
Billy Prince sits to the side–she glances at him throughout the poem,
it’s clearly about him.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Does he notice me? Does he hear my heart
screaming his name– sometimes it’s so loud I think the Gods can hear my
pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss. The
CLASS laughs at her except for Billy, who smiles at her, looking
slightly touched.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school library - day</strong>:
Seventeen-year-old Josie is surrounded by an elaborate, color-coded
index card system for her research paper. Her friend, SHEILA,
over-weight and pimply, comes running across the library at breakneck
speed. She sits down next to Josie, visibly excited and pushes her index
cards aside.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: O.K., what have you wanted for like ever but
you didn’t think it would -ever happen? Josie looks at her for a moment,
mulling it over.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That they’d start an Olympic team for grammar
- like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I’m
scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I’m so
young. But then there’s talk of me in the ’96 games-</p>
<p><strong>sheila.</strong>: No-, better. Something better Josie
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m the most popular girl in school, and
Billy Prince is taking me to prom. Josie laughs at the absurdity. She
looks at Sheila. Sheila is dead serious.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Billy Prince is asking you to prom.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy
Prince is asking me to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. The two girls look
at each other. Big smiles erupt into screams, as they jump up and down,
hugging each other. SFX - The BELL RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>- same</strong>: It’s the end of class. Students pack their
bags.</p>
<p><strong>sam:</strong>: O.K. - just a reminder. Your paper is due in
one week.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - same</strong>: Aldys and
Josie head out of class and down the hallway towards their lockers.
Josie stops in front of hers where the Makeout Couple continues their
clinch, blocking her locker. Josie pauses frustrated as Sydney’s Voice
comes over the loudspeaker.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Hey guys! Bad news–Chem wing is closed. The
Hazardous Materials Crew is on the way. Now, about prom. The entire
hallway STOPS to listen. The makeout Couple stop making out.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Please join a committee–because we are going
to KICK NORTHGLEN’S BUTT and make millennium the best prom EVER! The
hallway erupts in CHEERS. Josie makes a move to go for her locker. The
Makeout Couple are faster. They’re back in their clinch, blocking Josie
again.</p>
<p><strong>cu on guy</strong>: walking with his group.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Rufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Rufus?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah. I made it up. Start using it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What is with this school and prom?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Southglen South competes every year for best
prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don’t even go to prom. -But
to everyone else it’s huge.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Aldys, don’t miss your prom–it only happens
once.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: This one has been so hyped. We’re tied for
most wins with Northglen North. This year’s winner will determine the
winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen
picks has to be totally unique– INTERIOR. NORTHGLEN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -
DAY KIDS all stare at a loudspeaker.</p>
<p><strong>kid’s voice:</strong>: And this year’s prom theme is–the
millennium! The Northglen kids go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>interior. southglen high school hallway - same</strong>:
Josie reaches for her knapsack, and realizes she left it in English.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I left my bag in English. I’ll see you later.
Josie dashes down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>interior. classroom - same</strong>: Sam still sits at his
desk. He reads a book. Josie enters.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whoa. Deja Vu.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Sorry. Forgetful. Josie picks up her bookbag.
She notices the book Sam’s reading–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Dorothy Parker–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You like her?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I love the way she writes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not the happiest of souls. “Art is a form of
catharsis, and love is a permanent flop.”</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: But I think she wanted to be happy, that’s
why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: True. I guess she hadn’t completely given up
hope. Are you sure you’re seventeen?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Sure, why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers
from the ’30’s. They don’t even like people in their 30’s.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, I’m definitely seventeen and now
definitely late– And she smiles and runs out.</p>
<p><strong>interior. aldys’ car - night</strong>: Aldys drives, Josie
has shotgun and TYKE, Aldys’ nine-year-old sister, is in back. They all
hold double-scooped cones and they all sing FREE TO BE YOU AND ME at
full voice.</p>
<p><strong>tyke</strong>: See, aren’t you guys glad you took a break
from that Denominator stuff. I mean, you shouldn’t be spending your
Saturday night studying the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: we should be spending it thinking of how we
can better serve your baby-sitting needs?</p>
<p><strong>tyke</strong>: They pull up at a red light, next to an
abandoned drive-in. Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS,
standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. She
opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better
look.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: That’s the old drive-in. They call it “The
Court”. Now it’s just a continuous party for Guy’s group.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Gibby and Kristen talking by a car.</p>
<p><strong>aldys:</strong>: Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the
fact that they’re actually brainiacs with super powers and they’re
plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: No. It’s lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p><strong>angle back on: aldys and josie</strong>: Suddenly, Guy pokes
his head in, startling everyone.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Wow, if it isn’t Alpo. Coming out to sniff some
hydrants? Josie is frozen, but not Aldys.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Oh, Guy, you on a little break from having an
original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that’s all the time. Tyke gets it,
and laughs. Guy doesn’t get it at all.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You guys aren’t seriously trying to hang out at
The Court?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a
trashcan. Where do I sign up?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And stay away from prom.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Last I checked–this was still a free
country.</p>
<p><strong>tyke</strong>: There’s a land that I see, where the children
are free- Guy’s right in Aldys’ face, leaning over Josie. Aldys starts
to drive away. Guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside
the car.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Look, geek, why don’t you just go home and play
with your calculator. Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to
get cool. Guy stops running, and the car continues down the street.</p>
<p><strong>interior. car � continuous</strong>: Aldys seems a little
shaken, Tyke continues singing.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Are you kidding, Josie? It’s lame. All they
do is stand around and get drunk. It’s lame.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Yes, it’s lame.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go
there, and stand around?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - day</strong>: CLOSE ON a newspaper
headline: “THE COURT - SITE FOR PARTIES, DRUGS AND WEEKEND ARRESTS” - as
Gus throws the newspaper down on his desk. Josie sits across the desk
from him. She reads the headline, looking very surprised.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Josie, I am appalled. Josie picks up the paper,
and starts reading intently.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Jeez, so am I. I had no idea that these kids-
let’s see- turn to A14- She tries to turn to A14, but Gus grabs the
paper out of her hands in a rage.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in
there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this
in the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. Right. Gus angrily tries to fold the
paper back ’up. He’s having a hard time. Josie tries to help, but he
yanks it away. Gus reads aloud from the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Responding officers found minors, marijuana,
and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party
at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call “The Court.”
Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, “Yeah, everyone who’s anyone is at
The Court on Saturday night.”</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Kristen got a quote? Gus looks up at
Josie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes, urm, she’s right. I have learned it is a
very popular place for the young people to go.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Have you been there?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Uhh, no.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Have you been to any parties?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, how would you define to parties”?
Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session–
Gus looks like he may combust. He opens the newspaper, finds what he’s
looking for, and shoves it in Josie’s face. It is a picture of all of
the popular kids at Southglen- Kristen, Kirsten, Gibby, Guy- they are
all posing for the picture at The Court, smiling and holding beers.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: This is where the stories are. You are going to
become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You
are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you
are going to be in their same damn limo!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don’t-
I mean, I don’t think I can do this. He points to the picture in the
paper of the Popular Kids.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Do you even know these kids?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: They hid my car– Gus leans in very close.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my
job depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Depend on it. No s. Your subject is
plural.</p>
<p><strong>out!</strong>: Josie grabs her knapsack and does.</p>
<p><strong>interior. anita’s cubicle - continuous</strong>: Josie runs
through the bullpen, past Anita’s cubicle. ROGER from op/ed enters. He
and Anita smile flirtatiously.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Hi Roger from op/ed–</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hi Anita from classifieds. We still on for
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: of course– And he leans in and kisses her.
She pulls away, confused. A beat. Anita kisses him again. Nothing. ANITA
Y’know what? No, I don’t think we are on. I think I have to stay home.
Yeah. I’m staying home! I don’t know what I’ll do there, but I’m gonna
do it. Alone! Roger walks off.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. josie’s parents’ house - night</strong>: Rob opens
the door still dressed in his Tiki Post outfit. He takes one look at
Josie and knows that things are not good.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Are mom and dad here?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No. They’re at the Franklin Hint Expo at the
Skokie Holiday Inn.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Good. She shoves her way into the house. Rob
follows.</p>
<p><strong>interior. den - continuous</strong>: Josie storms into the
den, and plants herself on the sofa. She sees that Rob has been watching
baseball on T.V., and she turns it off.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I can’t do it. I thought I could. I can’t. I
give up–I’m never going to be a reporter. Rob sits next to her on the
couch. He looks up at the T.V.-, which is now off.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Did you catch the score? Josie gives him a look
of death.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, I mean, no big whoop.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I can’t do this. She pulls the article out of
her purse, and shoves it at Rob. He sees the picture of all the popular
kids at The Court.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we’ve got
some underage hotties on our hands, here!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Gus insists that I become friends with these
kids. The popular kids. It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Why is that impossible? Josie’s eyes get
teary.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob, you don’t know how it was for me back in
high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You
never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to
be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can’t do all that
again. I can’t go back to Southglen South.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh my God! You’re at Southglen South? They have
a killer baseball team.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob. Please focus. He puts his arm around
her.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Jos, you’ve been to college, you’re successful,
you wash your hair now– you’re not Josie Grossie anymore.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Don’t you realize how much I wanted to be you
in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be
popular?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Come on! It’s not that hard. All you need is
one person. Once the right person thinks you’re cool, you’re in.
Everyone else will be too scared to question it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Little known fact. Josie takes this in.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Look, don’t you wanna show them - Gus, Billy
Prince, yourself–that you’re not freaked out by the cool kids anymore?
That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes, desperately.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Plus, if you quit you’re no better than me.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Better than I…</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: That’s the spirit!</p>
<p><strong>exterior. high school parking lot - next morning</strong>:
Josie approaches the school. She’s clearly made a new attempt at style-
she’s teetering on too-high platform shoes and showing a blending white
midriff. No one pays much attention to her. GEORGE, thirty-something
African-American, the epitome of cool, waves Josie over to an open van
side door. Josie looks confused and scurries to the van.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: George! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just get in the van, Josie.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - moments later</strong>: High-tech
surveillance wonderland meets seventies living room. Tape players and
monitors share space with shag carpeting and a mini-fridge. Barry White
PLAYS on a TAPE. George starts to wrap wire around Josie’s waist. He
pins a kid’s plastic “captain’s wings” onto her collar.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hidden camera.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wings?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We used it for our expose on overweight
flight attendants–“Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of
Nuts?”</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m not doing this until I speak with
Gus.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Geller, stop being a pain in the ass. Josie
looks all around.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No, it’s the Great and Powerful Oz. Now
listen–you’re in over your head. This is how it’s gonna work. I review
the tapes, I find your story.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What if I say no?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the
cole slaw piece. Off Josie’s look of concern…</p>
<p><strong>exterior. school - minutes later</strong>: A crush of kids
flood up the stairs to the front door of the school. We see Kirsten,
Kristen and Gibby walking three abreast ahead of Josie up the stairs.
The Crowd parts around them. Josie heads towards them.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby– What’s up
girlfriends? The three girls pause and turn just as Josie, caught up in
the moment, doesn’t see a stray backpack on the stairs in front of her.
Josie trips and–</p>
<p><strong>josie-cam pov:</strong>: The CAMERA FACE-PLANTS into the
pavement.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - same</strong>: George watches the
monitor, winces.</p>
<p><strong>josie-cam pov:</strong>: The CAMERA still faces the
pavement.</p>
<p>****: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>interior. coulsom’s classroom - later</strong>: Josie is
standing, reading from her paper. Sam is rapt.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And so it is Rosalind, in disguise, who is
best able to see through the disguises of others. To say to Phebe,
“Mistress, know thy self,” to look at love from every angle, and to
realize, finally, that she is in love with Orlando– The BELL RINGS.
Class is over. Josie puts her stuff away and starts to follow the Cool
Girls out.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey guys, wait up– The Girls keep moving. Sam
stops Josie.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, Josie, hold on. You’ve been hiding
something from me.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Your writing. It’s amazing, Josie. You’re
really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So what are you thinking for college?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: College. Haven’t really thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s crazy. I’ll get you some
applications.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don’t
go to college. We just go right into sheep herding.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your
writing. You’re a natural.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks. Wow. That’s–really nice to hear.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Josie, you’re different. When you speak in
class, I can tell–You actually feel the words– in here. They’re alive.
Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon”? How for her it was
like a Concord grape. “That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to
suck out of its skin–”</p>
<p><strong>sam/josie</strong>: It –and swallow whole.” They both take a
breath in. Look away from each other.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van � same</strong>: George watches the
monitor.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - afternoon</strong>: Anita sits on
Gus’s desk, watches the last scene on Gus’s TV, engrossed. Gus walks in
and stops the tape.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Showtime’s over! Move-it! Back to work! Anita
climbs off his desk.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Gus, have you ever been in love?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Leave.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Oh give it up, Gus. I’m just making
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation,
deadlines, those I understand.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: You should go out every now and then, Gus;
with some new ties the girls would be all over you. Gus stares down at
his tie. But he’s smiling–a little.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Go away. I have enough work here to last me all
night.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Listen, I don’t have any plans–you want some
help?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No Roger from op/ed?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Nope. They share a smile.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway � day</strong>: Josie walks
toward her locker, the Make out Couple is at it again. Josie’s fed up.
She taps the Boy on his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Excuse me. Hi. Do you guys have some kind of
schedule I could work around? He ignores Josie and goes back to his
Girlfriend. Aldys, in her Denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins,
approaches Josie.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Hey, where’s your sweatshirt?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I � uhh, must have forgotten-</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I’ll
get it for you. She starts to leave.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Oh � I almost forgot � I’ll see you tonight
at Big Cup. 7:30, right? Josie looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Remember, that poet that we liked � the
reading he’s doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Right. 7:30.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: I’m late for lab. Aldys takes off. Josie
looks down the hall, where Guy, Kristen and the others are all looking
at a flyer pasted to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That is gonna be such a sweet show. I am so
there. Guy looks at Tommy and Jason, who f follow his lead.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, yeah, man, I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s gonna be Rufalicious.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re using it wrong. They head off, en masse.
Josie goes and looks at the flyer: “JIMMY CLIFF TONIGHT AT DELLOSER
HALL”. Josie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. club/delloser hall - night</strong>: Marquee reads
“Jimmy Cliff.” A crowd has gathered by the door. Josie gets out of cab,
and walks towards the club.</p>
<p><strong>interior. club/delloser hall - night</strong>: Josie enters
the small, smoky club. She wears what she considers to be her “hip
concert outfit,” an outfit that completely clashes with the Rasta wear
of the other concert goers. -She reaches the BOUNCER.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You Drinking? Josie notices the two Stoners
from school standing behind her in line.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I am not 21. I am only seventeen and I still
attend high school. The bouncer stamps her hand. She looks down at her
hand. WE CU ON her hand, reading DELLOSER. She enters as the two Stoners
approach the Bouncer.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Two of you? A beat as the Stoners look at
each other, realizing…</p>
<p><strong>stoner 1</strong>: Oh, Dude– And they run out of the
club.</p>
<p><strong>interior. club/delloser hall - same</strong>: JIIAMY CLIFF is
playing. The crowd sits at tables, grooving. Josie approaches the bar. A
guy turns around–it’s Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Josie–out on a school night. A woman, LARA,
emerges from the crowd. And puts her arm around SAM. An awkward
beat.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, right, sorry. Lara–Josie. Josie–Lara.
Josie’s a student of mine. Lara’s my-date.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: Nice to meet you. Another awkward pause.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, let’s go dance. The crowd roars
over Cliff’s next song as Lara drags San off into the crowd. Sam looks
back briefly at Josie as we lose him into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>angle on josie</strong>: She sees Guy’s group sitting at a
table and approaches an empty seat. They immediately scoot around so
that the seat is taken. Undeterred, Josie sees a seat at the next table
and sits down in it. She looks up to see that she is at a table of huge
RASTAFARIANS. They all wear big Rasta hats and even bigger hair and are
smoking a joint the size of Cuba. She smiles awkwardly.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi. Is it okay if I sit here?</p>
<p><strong>rasta #1</strong>: Oh, ya mon. We accept all peoples. We are
all about da’ love. Josie and the Rasta’s start to groove to the music.
Josie looks over at Guy’s table, sees they are toking off a small joint
and passing it around.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continous</strong>: George and his
DATE, a Pam Grier look-alike, sit close on the couch, grooving to the
CONCERT PLAYING on the monitor and through the various speakers. CU on
the monitor.</p>
<p><strong>josie-cam pov:</strong>: The joint the size of Cuba is passed
into frame. Josie’s hand takes it. Catching sight of this, George and
his Date exchange concerned looks.</p>
<p><strong>interior. club/delloser hall - later</strong>: Josie is high
beyond belief, wearing a big Rasta hat and loudly laughing her ass off
as the Rastas just stare. She can hardly keep herself in her chair.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Get it?! Get it?! He was a firecracker! She
lifts up Rasta 1’s dreadlocks to get his ear.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: A firecracker! And she cracks up again.</p>
<p><strong>rasta #1</strong>: I don’t love her. Rastas share looks ill
around. Then Josie hears the first strains of “The Harder They
Come”–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh my God! This music rules! And Josie
proceeds to get up and take over the place–she’s dancing on the table,
getting up with the band and playing the bongos, all with absolutely no
rhythm or style. But with a lot of whooping. The club is agog.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Lara and Sam. They both look aghast.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: She’s a student of yours?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s from Bali. And as Josie continues to
dance on stage, making a total fool of herself, Jimmy Cliff turns to
CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy:</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment - later</strong>: Josie is on the
phone, and is in the process of finishing an entire pie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m telling you, Rob! I think I did it! I’m
totally in! I was soo cool tonight! You’d be so– You know what’s a weird
word? Fork. Wait! Wait! Did I tell you about my new friends? I made
friends with a whole table of Rastafarians! Not one, a whole table! Oh.
My. God. Someone ate my entire pie.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment - next morning</strong>: Josie is
asleep where we left her, her head on her hand, empty pie plate nearby.
She wakes, picks her head up. Looks down at her hand, the DELLOSER stamp
is faint. CLOSE UP ON her forehead. There in block letters backwards is
“LOSER”. She looks up at the clock, which reads: 8:30. She’s late. Very
late. She grabs her book bag and her keys, and races out.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - morning</strong>: Josie
strides confidently down the hallway, LOSER prominently on her forehead.
She sees Guy and his Group.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi Guy. Guys. Guy’s Guys. They stare, then
snicker.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hi loser. The group laughs and joins in, saying
“Hey Loser.” Josie’s face registers confusion.</p>
<p><strong>josie-cam pov:</strong>: We move slowly down the packed
hallway, the camera shifting nervously amidst a sea of laughing kids.
The LAUGHTER starts to ECHO. Josie starts to walk quickly, then run,
through the gauntlet of’ laughing and pointing kids.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continuous</strong>: WE HEAR THE
LAUGHING, the JOSIE CAM JERKS frantically from KID to KID.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This can not be good–</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - continuous</strong>: JOSIE
CAM P.O.V. WE HEAR Josie BREATHING HEAVILY as she runs past KIDS who all
stare or LAUGH. She makes it to the Girls Room, pushes open the
door.</p>
<p><strong>interior. girls’ bathroom - continuous</strong>: Josie goes
to the sink, splashes water on her face.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van continous</strong>: George watches the
monitor, HANDS splash water. A HAND grabs a paper towel. George can now
see Josie reflected in the bathroom mirror. He sees the “LOSER” stamp on
her forehead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh man. Look up, girl. C’mon, Look up–</p>
<p><strong>interior. girls’ bathroom - continuous</strong>: Josie wipes
her mouth. Throws the towel away. Goes to exit–</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continuous</strong>: George is now
apoplectic.</p>
<p><strong>interior. bathroom - continuous</strong>: Josie pauses, goes
back to the mirror. She looks up. Sees the stamp. Her hand goes to her
mouth in horror. She runs into a stall.</p>
<p><strong>josie cam p.o.v.</strong>: WE FACE the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continuous</strong>: George looks at
the monitor in amazement.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - day</strong>: A Group is watching
Gus’s TV, including Bruns and Howard . They are slack-jawed in shock. WE
HEAR O.S. the SOUNDS of Josie VOMITING. Gus shakes his head sadly.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It’s like the All-Humiliation Network. They all
nod in agreement.</p>
<p><strong>interior. girls’ bathroom - minutes later</strong>: Josie is
in the fetal position on the floor of a stall.</p>
<p><strong>interior. den - night</strong>: The den of Josie’s parents’
home. Josie is decked out. She’s wearing a pretty hideous metallic pink
dress, matching gloves, bag, shoes. She’s shining her braces, using the
T.V. screen as a mirror. The PHONE RINGS. Josie grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey, Billy. I’m ready. Sure, I can just wait
for you on the front porch. See you in a -uhh- jiffer. She hangs up.
Sixteen year old Rob, very cute and buff, enters. His pretty GIRLFRIEND
is on his arm.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Jiffer? Rob just shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. josie’s front porch night</strong>: Josie, in all
her prom splendor, waits out on the front porch for her date. She sees a
LONG, BLACK LIMO turn the corner, headed for the house. She’s hopping up
and down with excitement. She checks her reflection in her compact, and
then watches the limo approach. The sunroof of the limo opens and Billy
Prince, the Adonis of the suburbs, stands up, sticking out of the
sunroof. He waves. Josie smiles and waves back. Then, another figure
joins Billy’s. It’s a GORGEOUS BLONDE in a slinky dress. She’s standing
up, sticking out of the sunroof as well. Josie looks a bit confused, but
still tries to smile. Then, she sees them holding things. LITTLE THINGS.
LITTLE WHITE THINGS. Before Josie realizes what’s going on, her metallic
ensemble is covered in dripping, oozing eggs. One whacks her right in
her trifocals.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, write a poem about this! Billy and his
date lob a few more eggs, and their limo roars off. Josie stands on the
porch, alone. She’s got egg in her hair, on her face, all over her
dress- everywhere. She starts to cry. Softly at first, moving into big,
loud, wet sobs. She sits down on the porch, her head in her hands, and
just keeps crying.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - - day</strong>: Homeroom has
just gotten out, and the halls are packed with kids. Josie is running
full speed, trying to negotiate around lots of kids, in her frantic-race
for the door. Kids still point and stare. She bangs into some freshmen,
gets whacked by a book bag, slides some banners that kids are painting -
but she won’t slow down. Just as she’s almost at the doors to the
school, the BIG WOODEN DOOR to the front office opens. Josie can’t stop.
A figure emerges, but before Josie can even see who it is, she slams
into it and goes down. She bangs her head on the hard linoleum
floor.</p>

<p><strong>josie-cam pov:</strong>: We see two KIDS looking down into
the camera.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey–you okay? Camera nods “yes” slowly. Tommy
and Jason come into frame.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wow. You took a pretty big fall.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah. Like every loser should. And they move
out of frame, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: As every loser should.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you O.K.? Josie, are you O.K.? Rob comes
into frame.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - continuous</strong>: Rob is
bent over Josie. She rubs her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’ve been in a horrible accident. This is a
coma-induced nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No. Josie, this is real. She looks up.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh my God! That’s worse! What are you doing
here?! Rob leans in and whispers to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I just registered. Rob whips out his fake ID
and shows it to her.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Manufactured at the Tiki Post. Rob helps Josie
up.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Are you crazy?! You can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The
game isn’t over–I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball
team, the right scout sees me– I’m into the minors-it’s game time!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You’re twenty-three years old!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: With the reading comprehension of a fifteen
year old! Plus, I’m popular… You want to be popular… I can recognize a
cry for help when I see one.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know,
you can’t just come in here and be popular in just one day.</p>
<p><strong>interior. cafeteria - later</strong>: Josie emerges from the
cafeteria line with her tray. A LOUD CHANT comes from one of the
tables.</p>
<p><strong>rob, rob, rob</strong>: She turns to see Rob in the middle of
a hot dog eating contest with a HUGE WRESTLER. Rob downs his last one,
raises his hands in victory. The CROWD goes WILD. Rob sits down at Guy’s
table.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Dude, you rock! He high-fives Rob. A pretty
girl, TRACY approached Rob.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hi. I’m Tracy and I’m sixteen and I’m a
gymnast and I don’t have a boyfriend…</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Thank you. I’m Rob.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>angle back on josie</strong>: Aldys approaches.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Hey � where were you last night? I was
worried. Josie can’t take her eyes off Rob sitting at Guy’s table. Aldys
notices Josie’s distraction.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling
you, but I only got your machine. I don’t even know your parents line
and I was really worried.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh. I forgot. Aldys is really hurt.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Well, maybe you should forget about sitting
with us too. Josie just stands there all alone.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. track - later</strong>: Girls P.E. is over. The
girls head back to the locker room. Josie lags behind the group, and
then wanders over to the baseball diamond, where she hears a bunch of
hoots and hollers.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball diamond - same</strong>: The team is
practicing. Rob has just hit a home run with three men on. EVERYONE
CHEERS him on as he runs the bases. As he comes into home, he is met
with congrats, high fives. Everyone loves him. Josie watches the whole
scene, seething with jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>interior. girls’ locker room - later</strong>: Josie,
post-shower, is wrapped in a towel and carrying her sweaty gym clothes.
A group of GIRLS walk by her, giggling as they exit. She approaches her
locker and finds it ajar and completely empty. She looks from the empty
locker down to the sweaty clothes in her hand. A realization sweeps over
her face.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - later</strong>: Josie
shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym
clothes. She is clearly beaten. She looks down the hall, stunned. It is
ridiculous Rob is being followed by a posse, everyone knows his name.
Girls tug on his shirt, guys slap him on the back or high-five him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Robster, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: The Rob man. My man Rob.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Hey, Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Hi there Robbie Rob. Josie sees Guy
approach Rob, and shake his hand.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey Robo- how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Nice pants, man. They are rufus. Guy smiles.
Josie looks like she’s going to hurl. She looks down the hall the other
way- where a huge banner hangs that reads:</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hey Rob, see you at the carnival later?</p>
<p><strong>stoner 1</strong>: It’s Robilicious! Josie looks on the wall
next to her- and sees a list:</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh, please. Josie has seen enough, and walks
on.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. carnival grounds - night</strong>: Establishing
shot of a smallish carnival, Ferris wheel, midway, tea cups ride. Near
the entrance reads a banner: “SOUTHGLEN HIGH SENIOR NIGHT”.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. carnival midway - same</strong>: Aldys and the
Denominators stand in front of a booth that displays a large glass jar
of jellybeans. Calculators and paper out, they’re engrossed in find the
answer. Josie walks by alone. The Denominators don’t notice her.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. the ferris wheel - same</strong>: WE PAN DOWN the
line of KIDS waiting to ride the Ferris wheel. In front are Tommy,
Jason, Gibby and Kirsten.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: This has been so much fun! We’ve been first
in line for every ride!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s cuz we cut every line. WE PAN DOWN to
the end of the line, where we find Josie, standing alone. She’s trying
her best to keep her game face on. The CARNY opens the gate, the Kids
pile onto the ride, two by two. Josie reaches an empty car–the last
one–and gets in. The Carny holds the safety bar open.</p>
<p><strong>carny</strong>: Where’s your partner?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t–I don’t have one–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Do you have to yell like that? Sam, standing
by a vendor, looks over and notices Josie’s predicament.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Of course it’s Loser that’s holding up the
ride! Sam walks up to the Josie’s bucket.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thank you. He gets in. The ride JERKS into
motion.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whoa. They start a slow ascent. Sam seems ill
at ease.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Are you–scared?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m gonna tell you something here, and I hope
it doesn’t undermine my position as an authority figure. I’m a little
afraid of heights.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You’re afraid of the Ferris wheel.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Actually, it’s more the plunging head first
into the crowd part that gets me.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh right. The Spiderman incident.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You remember that story?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Of course. I remember everything from your
class. They smile at each other. The smile is interrupted by a HEAVY
SWAYING of their bucket, caused by Tommy ROCKING in the bucket ahead.
Sam looks a little green.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yoooooow.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Don’t look down! They’re facing the ground at
this point.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Out of my control.</p>
<p><strong>tommy! cut it out! enough!</strong>: Tommy stops. Sam turns
to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I said that as a chaperone. They start to
ascend again. Sam relaxes. SAM Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you
something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’s what makes you interesting. As a
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: God, I would love to think I’m an interesting
teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had
any passion at all.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the
classroom.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You have to say that. You’re my student.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t have to say that. They look into each
other’s eyes just as Tommy RATTLES his bucket ruthlessly.</p>
<p><strong>if the bucket’s a-rockin’, don’t come-a knockin’.</strong>:
Josie and Sam laugh uncomfortably.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boys.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d like to tell you that we all grow out of
it, but that’s a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. And you know what’s scary–when
you get older it just gets more confusing. I’ve spent the last ten years
with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I
shouldn’t be talking about this stuff with you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’s okay. It’s nice to have someone to
talk to– The bucket is rocked again by Tommy–Sam grips the safety
bar.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Same here. They stop rocking but they’re still
stuck at the top. SAM All I can tell you is that when you’re my age, the
guys will be lined up around the block for you. They share a smile.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You have to say that. You’re my teacher.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I shouldn’t say that, because I’m your teacher.
They look at each other, their smiles fading into realization. Suddenly,
the car jerks, and they start to move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out
of their reverie. They smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small
laugh. WIDE SHOT of the Ferris wheel as Josie and Sam descend.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thanks, Josie. This wasn’t as bad as I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: When are you going to open your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m thinking when I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball dugout - day</strong>: Rob sits with a
bunch of BASEBALL PLAYERS. MATZ and PACKER, the studs of the team, come
into the dugout and join them.</p>
<p><strong>packer</strong>: Hey Rob, thanks for showing me that new
grip. It totally changed my swing.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No problem, man. They do one of those
elaborate, fraternity-like handshakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Rob
sees Josie walking alone across the field. He gets an idea.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hey, you guys know that girl, Josie Geller?</p>
<p><strong>matz</strong>: You mean “Loser”?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, dude, Josie. We used to go out and she
dumped me. But we’re still good friends. And she is� amazing, if you
know what I mean. The guys are all stunned.</p>
<p><strong>interior. biology classroom - day</strong>: Gibby stands
staring at a skeleton with Rob and the Cool Girls.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: All right–that’s it. Just water and Ex-Lax
till prom.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hey–Josie’s Dad invented that stuff. Josie’s
like the heiress to the Ex- Lax fortune.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah. She’s loaded. She spends all her
vacations on the family yacht in the south of France. They react.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. track - day</strong>: Rob stands behind the
bleachers with Tommy, Jason, and Guy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: She used to date the drummer for The Big Bad
Voodoo Daddys?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No way. I always wanted to be a drummer.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah well, she left him for the drummer from
“Sister Hazel.” Y’know the song “All for You?”</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That was about Josie? Rufus�</p>
<p><strong>interior. cafeteria - day</strong>: Josie turns with her tray
after paying. Aldys sees her.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Hey, Josie–I’m really sorry I snapped at you.
Do you wanna– Josie sees Rob waving her over to “the table” where
Kristen, Gibby and the gang sit.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh, Aldys, y’know, I have to– And Josie walks
over to Guy’s table, leaving Aldys staring after her. Josie sits down at
the table. Everyone stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Hey Josie. It’s Josie, right?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Can I just say–I totally love Ex-Lax.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Okay, that’s good to know–</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I can’t believe you dated Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy. Josie shoots a look at Rob.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hey, I told you–Josie doesn’t like to talk
about that.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Yeah, Tommy, that’s totally gochay.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: I think it’s pronounced gauche.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah it’s French. There’s no accent aigue, so
the e is soft. A silent beat. Josie thinks she may have blown it.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Duh, of course you would know that. From
being on your yacht in the south of France. They all smile at her. Josie
soaks in her newfound popularity.</p>
<p><strong>interior. science classroom - day</strong>: On the walls are
SAFE SEX posters. On the front desk, pamphlets on sexually transmitted
diseases share space with plastic biology cross-section models of male
and female reproductive organs. Sam stands in front of his English
class, impatiently looking at his watch. Josie looks up from her desk,
sees Anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door. Josie’s
eyes widen, she starts to make “get out of here” movements. Sam notices
Josie and follows her gaze to Anita. He opens the door, speaks sotto to
Anita.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hi. You’re here for the sex talk?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Well. I like a man who gets to the point.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re Pam?</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: If you say so. Sam turns to the class.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Welcome juniors and seniors, this is Pam
Kitterman. She’s our district health counselor. She’s here to lead our
sex discussion. He ushers a surprised Anita to the front of the room.
Josie reacts.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I am? Oh, I am. Hi. Okay. Sex. Yes, well,
sex. What’s to say really, y’know? You like a guy, you do it. Sometimes
he calls. Sometimes he doesn’t. Anita leans into Josie, talks sotto.
ANITA Hi!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What are you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I had a lunch break so I thought I’d come by
and see you. Your teacher is a fox! . Why don’t we discuss that after
class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over
already.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Right. Right. Anita walks back to the front
of the classroom. ANITA Okay, sex. Let’s see. Sex is really fun. When
you’re old enough. Which none of you are, trust me I should know cuz
when you lose it to some guy named Junior with really bad breath in the
back of a van at a Guns and Roses concert you’re gonna wish you listened
to your Mom when she said, y’know, no one’s gonna want to buy the whole
friggin ice cream truck when you’re handing out the popsicles for free.
There’s a deafening silence. The kids are amazed. ANITA Okay. Any
questions?</p>
<p><strong>interior. science classroon - later</strong>: The Kids all
have bananas and condoms. They are in various stages of putting the
condom over the banana. Anita walks among them, clearly more comfortable
with her role now.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Okay. I know it’s hard. Titters from the
group. ANITA Difficult. But safe sex is really important. I try to
practice it every day. Josie reacts. ANGLE ON KIRSTEN &amp; KRISTEN.
Their condoms are snugly on their bananas. They stare at Josie.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: wait, rewind. Do you really think she
hooked-up with our Rob? They’re so–different.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Sometimes opposites attract.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Yeah. Look at Bert and Ernie. WE ANGLE ON
ANITA. She’s walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: So just..imagine the bananas are the real
thing. She takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at it. She
snorts. ANITA In a land called “every man’s fantasy”. She looks up, sees
the real MISS KITTERMAN , standing outside the door and waving. Without
missing a beat, Anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: JOSIE AND TRACY still struggling with
condoms.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: God, I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Maybe because we’re not supposed to be having
sex with bananas.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You know what, though? I feel like I’m really
ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wow. That’s big. I mean sex is a really big
deal. You shouldn’t do it until you know you’ve found the right person.
ANGLE ON SAM, listening. Josie is oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They
spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they
find it, they know. That’s the penguin they stay with for the rest of
their lives.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: But I’m not a penguin.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s an analogy. A surprised Josie looks up to
see Sam next to her. She lets her condom go. And it flies off her banana
into his face. Josie turns to Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Excuse me. I have to go die now. The class is
interrupted by Sydney over the loudspeaker:</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Hey guys–Sydney again! Don’t forget–No going
into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. And about prom�
Everyone freezes. Dead silence. SYDNEY Really bad news. We just got the
word from intelligence– Northglen High is doing the Millennium too!
Complete chaos. SCREAMING terror. A GIRL faints. Sera squeezes her
banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. Other KIDS are beating their
bananas against desktops. Brett, the football player, absentmindedly
peels his banana and begins eating it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All right guys, let’s calm down. Calm down.
Sit! They all do, including Anita. SAM Now look. Let’s focus. Prom
theme. We need a new idea.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: OH! How about “Under the Sea?” She’s met with
a round of “boos”. Anita reacts. ANITA Well excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What about the “Roaring Twenties”� or “The
80’s”? The Class lets out a GIANT GROAN on that one.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: What do you think we are? Amateurs?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Josie.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: That’s not a theme.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, Josie will have the answer. A long beat.
Expectant faces all turn to Josie. She looks at Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How about–’ meant for each other–Famous
couples throughout history? Another beat as the Class considers.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah. That’s it. The Class suddenly
CONCURS.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Yeah. /That’s it. /Rufus. Josie soaks in all
the approval like a sponge.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks. Thank you. Josie looks from Sam and
Anita’s smiling faces to find Guy smiling at her. CLOSE UP ON A BANNER
reading: “MILLENNIUM”. It comes down, replaced by one that reads: “MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER… WIDEN TO REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - day</strong>: Josie and the
Cool Girls walk under the banner, laughing. We PAN UP to their lapels
and see that they are all wearing replicas of Josie-’s geeky airplane
pin. They pass Aldys, Josie is oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>interior. mall - day</strong>: Josie and the Girls walk four
abreast, like a pack of proud lions. Kids part to let them through.</p>

around.</p>
<p><strong>interior. music room - day</strong>: Josie and Sam pick out
CDs from a DJ’s case. Josie picks one out and puts it in the “yes” pile.

Josie sneaks it back.</p>
<p><strong>interior. teen clothing store - same</strong>: Josie’s hiding
behind a rack of clothes, talking on her cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m telling you Gus. It’s a great story. They
keep the tags on, then return the clothes after they’ve worn them.
Gus?–Gus? Kirsten discovers Josie behind the rack. Josie quickly pulls a
cardigan off a rack, feigning interest in it. The Girls all do the
same.</p>
<p><strong>interior. hall concourse - same</strong>: Josie and the
Girls, wearing matching cardigans, walk past Aldys and another
Denominator on their way to the escalator. Josie and Aldys lock eyes and
Josie smiles but Aldys turns her back to her.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Look, there goes another Lemming. WE ANGLE ON
the escalator as Josie and the Girls rise single file out of- FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball stands - day</strong>: Josie sits with her
new friends, emulating them by sunning in a bikini top and shorts while
they watch the game.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Josie, you have totally transitioned.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Transitioned?</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: You crossed over.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Into our group.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: It’s really hard to do. Some kids try for
all of-high school and never make it.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio’s
uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>gibby:</strong>: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: We’d love to transition a gay guy into the
group.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: We’re very evolved.</p>
<p><strong>on the field</strong>: A BALL sails fast and hard. It looks
like it’s going to be a base hit, into left Field, but the shortstop
leaps up and grabs it. That shortstop is Rob. The Team cheers. Coach
Romano heads out of the dugout towards Rob.</p>
<p><strong>in the stands</strong>: Josie and the Gang leap up and cheer.
Josie almost loses her top, but catches it, just as Guy comes around the
side of the stands and notices Josie.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball diamond - continuous</strong>: Coach
Romano approaches Rob. Slaps him on the back.</p>
<p><strong>coach romano</strong>: Great playing, Rob. You might be just
what Southglen South needs to get to Nationals.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I’m playing in the championship game?</p>
<p><strong>coach romano</strong>: Playing? You’re starting shortstop.
And I don’t mean to put more pressure on you but there are going to be
some pro scouts there.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh man! Rob grabs Coach Romano in a bear hug.
The Coach is uncomfortable. Rob moves towards the dugout and the Coach
happily slaps him on the ass.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball stands - same</strong>: Josie and the
Girls are leaving. Guy catches up to them and taps Josie on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So–you going to the party at Rob’s? Josie’s
taken aback. The Girls notice Guy’s interest.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob’s?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah, you gonna be there? Josie stumbles on a
step Guy immediately reaches out to steady her. She melts. She can’t
even speak, so she just nods.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Good. I’ll see you tonight. Guy walks off.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: He is totally crunching on you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Do I want to be crunched?</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: By Guy?</p>
<p><strong>gibby/kristen/kirsten</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>interior. sun times elevator - day</strong>: CAMERA PANS the
faces of some dull-looking workers. It stops on Josie, who stands out in
her teen garb and huge knapsack. A star struck female WORKER turns to
her.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: I really loved you in the sex-ed scene.
Josie reacts.</p>
<p><strong>interior. bullpen - continous</strong>: Josie spills out the
elevator and races through the bullpen with Rhoda in pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>rhoda</strong>: Splendiferous– Josie stops, turns back to
her.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Totally. Josie keeps going. A confused Rhoda
stares after her. She passes Merkin’s desk. He is still on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: No way … Yeah? … No way. Josie reaches over,
grabs the phone out of his hand and hangs up without missing a beat. She
continues on as Merkin stares after her. Josie reaches the conference
room door. An older WOMAN runs out crying.</p>
<p><strong>interior. conference room - continuous</strong>: Rigfort
presides over a staff meeting. CLOSE UP on stunned office WORKERS’
faces.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Alrighty then–next on the agenda-sack races
at the company picnic-yes or no? Josie sneaks in. She pushes past
workers to get to a chair, big backpack whacking them as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi. Sorry I’m late. Sorry. Excuse me– Josie
takes the chair next to Anita’s. Anita looks her up and down.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: I love that jacket.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Miss Geller, what’s the status on your
story?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh it’s great. Totally Rufus. Gus and Anita
look at each other, both mouthing “Rufus?”</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I have, um– Josie dumps out her backpack on
the table. Teen items spill out-notebooks, CDs, barrettes, a hacky sac,
a Frisbee, glitter nail polish. She rifles through it all–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: –notes here somewhere- There’s my math
homework!</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Geller, I don’t need your notes. I need
your story. Though I speak for everyone when I say I’ve seen the tapes.
Compelling stuff. All the workers nod in agreement.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: But I want a story in two weeks. I’m saving
the “Life and Style” cover for you. You’re gonna make one hell of a
reporter. Oh, and if you don’t, you and Gus are fired. Josie and Gus
react.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Now, onto the next order of business.
Marketing department-yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>exterior. josie’s parents’ house � night</strong>: Beer cans
and kids litter the lawn. Josie pulls into the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s parents house � same</strong>: Josie makes
her way through the THRONGS OF KIDS. It’s a big high school “rager” lots
of big blue keg cups, drunk girls, etc. The cool Girls are present and
socializing. Josie finally makes her way to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>interior. kitchen - same</strong>: Rob is mixing margaritas,
wearing a big sombrero. Tracy sits on the counter, gazing lovingly at
Rob’s every move.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey Rob, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m Rob’s prom date. Josie glares at Rob.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: And a gymnast!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: She’s sixteen years old, Rob. That’s totally
and completely illegal. Josie feels an arm around her shoulder. It’s
Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey there.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hey. There. Guy takes Josie’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come here. I want to ask you something. Rob
watches them leaving the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: See you around the cellblock, Mrs. Robinson.
Josie turns around and gives him a death look. Tracy turns to Rob.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Rob, what do you want to be when you grow
up?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Well, a ball player.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No, I know. But, what if you don’t make it?
’I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your
life. It’s okay for an after school job, but, come on, “hi, I’m Rob and
I run the Tiki Post”?! Totally lame. Tracy starts to giggle. Rob does
not.</p>
<p><strong>interior. upstairs hallway - continuous</strong>: Guy and
Josie stand in front of Josie’s old room. A bicycle license plate that
says-“JOSIE” is nailed to the door. She stands in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Maybe we should go in a different room?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I already checked. There are some pretty
serious couples in there. Guy reaches for the doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s old bedroom - continuous</strong>: They go
in. Josie sees her spelling bee trophies- with her name. She turns them
around, trying to appear nonchalant. As Guy enters, he eyes the
trophies, the stuffed animals, the many sets of encyclopedias.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Wow, Rob’s sister must be such a loser. Josie
manages a weak smile. Guy sits on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come here, sit down. She sits on the bed, and
then sees a picture of her and her family on the bedside table. She
dives across the bed to overturn it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m sure you’ve probably heard that I want to
ask you, but I’d like to know if you’d go to prom with me. I know we
didn’t hit it off right at the beginning but-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes. I’ll go. Yes. Guy leans in as if to kiss
her and whispers…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Rufus. But I don’t even know where you
live.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You know what? Why don’t you just pick me up
here? We could all share a limo.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Cool. I’ll catch you later. Guy leaves. Josie
is ecstatic and flops back on her bed. Stuffed animals fall all around
her.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - day</strong>: Josie and Rob
walk confidently through the hallway. Kids greet and high five them
both.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey Jos. Hey Robster.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Looking good guys.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey Jos. Rob, rufus kegger. Rob and Josie
turn the corner.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob, this is unbelievable. I mean– Josie
shoves through the double doors leading into the gym.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gym - continuous</strong>: The place is a flurry of
activity, a staging area for prom. Various committees are set up at
tables throughout the room. Josie and Rob enter.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: –I spent my whole life wanting to fit in, and
now– Gibby and Kirsten run up to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or
Veronica?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Betty. Gibby turns to Kirsten.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Told you. And they move off. Rob spots Tracy
and moves off to her.</p>
<p>****: I always liked Betty better. Josie turns, sees Sam.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You did? And they begin to walk through the
prom prop area, and it begins to appear like a romantic date–they pass
flowers, he picks one out, they pass a bistro table, a backdrop of a
sunset follows them for awhile, etc.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh yeah. Betty was so spunky and fun. Veronica
may have had great legs, but she was too moody. Very high maintenance.
Josie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A TABLE where Kristen and Tommy are
selling prom tickets. Aldys is standing in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: You can’t not sell me a ticket to prom.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen, Alpo–we can do whatever we want.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: Oh, I get it. It’s that pesky making change
part that’s confusing you guys. Here. I’ll make it easy. Money- Ticket.
Aldys takes her ticket, walks off. Tommy and Kristen turn to each other
and start whispering conspiratorially.</p>
<p><strong>angle back on: josie and sam</strong>: Sera runs up to
Josie.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Josie, were Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum a
couple? Josie and Sam share a look.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, in a strict sense, probably not. But
for prom–sure.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Thanks! Sera turns off.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re really doing a great job here, Josie. I
like your “can do” attitude.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks. They weren’t related to Humpty
Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg
shape in common.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: But Humpty Dumpty was alone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s sad, isn’t it? He had to sit on that
wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’s really what we all need, right?
Someone to sit up on the wall with us–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah. To watch the world go by.–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: To put us back together again when we fall.
They share a meaningful glance and a smile.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Our penguin, right?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Do you think you’ll find her?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, actually I do. They are lost in each
other. They lean closer, as if they may kiss, then Sam breaks the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh my God! I almost forgot–I got you a meeting
with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What! But–I wasn’t even going to go to
college–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him
to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh–yikes!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I told him –if I’m wrong about this girl, you
can take away my teaching certificate!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wow. You believe in me that much–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to
yourself–to your writing, to go to college. You’re a great writer. You
just have to find your story. As they share a meaningful look, WE FREEZE
FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - later</strong>: Gus and Josie sit in
front of his TV. The image of Sam and Josie is frozen on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That’s your story!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You’re crazy. I can’t–I can’t-no. No.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It’s got it all–sex, intrigue, immorality in
the education system–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: He’s my teacher!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: And that’s the best part. “Teacher-Student
Relations: How close is too close?” We’re gonna blow the lid off it!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: There is no lid! Nothing’s going on between
Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not yet. Every person in this office comes in
here and watches you guys! It’s like the goddamn Young and the Restless!
Rigfort’s salivating over it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You already pitched this to Rigfort?! Gus
leans in, now all business.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Josie, this isn’t a joke. You heard Rigfort.
It’s both of our asses on the line. This is your story.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment - bedroom - night</strong>: Josie
is getting ready for prom. She wears her bathrobe and is doing her
make-up. She looks over at her dresser where she eyes the camera/flight
wings pin tentatively.</p>
<p><strong>interior. den - night</strong>: Rob, in boxers, a dress
shirt, and socks is filling flasks with vodka. Josie comes in the door
wearing a lovely Elizabethan gown. She looks absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Wow, Josie- you look really-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rufus?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks. And what are -</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Duh. Tom Cruise. “Risky Business”. He puts on
his black wayfarer sunglasses, and does the famous slide into the living
room. Josie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rob–thanks. For everything. This is really
happening. I never thought–</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I know. Rob smiles and exits. Josie nervously
checks her reflection in the T.V. - just like she did eight years ago.
She takes a deep breath, and goes out.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. front porch - same</strong>: Josie comes out on the
porch, and sees the limo rounding the corner, just like eight years
before. The sunroof opens. And Guy stands up - holding something. Josie
panics - and starts to take cover - but then sees he’s holding a dozen
white roses. And holding them out to her.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come on beautiful - what are you waiting for?
Josie, smiling, runs down the driveway to the limo.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. country club - night</strong>: Prom night. And it
really is magical. Twinkling lights dot the trees, MUSIC wafts out from
the club. A neon sign that says “Meant For Each Other” blinks above the
building.- COUPLES make their way inside. We see MORK a MINDY, ANTONY a
CLEOPATRA and Sera dressed as a RABBIT. Annoyed, she turns back to her
lagging date, Brett, dressed as a TORTOISE.</p>
<p><strong>sera</strong>: Hello! If you don’t hurry up we’re gonna miss
the whole thing! Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen exit limos with their
DATES. They all wear the same straight blonde wig, and look at each
other in horror.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu
Barbie idea.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Uh uh. I’m Disco Barbie. Kirsten’s wearing
a short, tight miniskirt.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: And I’m Evening Gown Barbie.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Right. That’s not an evening gown.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: It is on Barbie. Josie and Guy approach,
dressed in Elizabethan costume. They look great.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Josie, you look Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Who are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: Don’t tell me�you’re Medieval Barbie.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Rosalind and Orlando. From “As You Like It”?
Shakespeare? It’s like talking to a sack of hammers. Guy interjects.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Look! I get to have a sword! And they all ooh
and ahh.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club � continous</strong>: WE FOLLOW Josie
and the group into the prom. The place looks amazing. Lights, ice
sculptures, champagne fountains. WE PAN DOWN the buffet. A BOY dressed
as a jar of PEANUT BUTTER and his date, JELLY, are getting food. Peanut
Butter turns away from the buffet and bumps into a GIRL dressed as a
CHOCOLATE BAR.</p>
<p><strong>peanut butter</strong>: oh, sorry. There’s a magical beat as
they smile at each other.</p>
<p><strong>chocolate bar</strong>: That’s okay– Jelly looks on,
chagrined. We reach two OLDER GENTLEMEN in tuxes who carry clipboards
and wear big buttons that read: NATIONAL PROM JUDGE. They contemplate
the ice sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>judge #1</strong>: It’s deft and unique without being
derivative.</p>
<p><strong>judge #2</strong>: Hey! Pigs in blankets! And he runs
off.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - later that night</strong>: Josie
sits with the COOL GROUP at a table. Kristen is making odd faces.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Kristen, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I’m practicing my surprised face for when
we get named to prom court. JOSEPH and a very pregnant MARY approach
their table and try to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Sorry. There’s no room at this table.
Joseph and Mary amble off. Guy turns to Josie.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You having fun?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the
spectacle around her.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continuous</strong>: Candles are
lit. George’s Date sits on the couch. The monitor is on showing the
JOSIE CAM POV. He flips the switch, the lights dim and a small disco
ball starts moving slowly. George settles in next to his Date.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - continuous</strong>: The entire
office is crammed into Gus’s office. Anita sits up front, spellbound,
watching the JOSIE CAM. Gus stands in back. Okay, he’s a little
interested too.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: This is the most beautiful prom I have ever
been to. Cynthia runs in with a bowl of popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Did I miss the crowning?</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: No, but I’m closing the pool in five
minutes. Merkin holds out a bowl of cash.</p>
<p><strong>merkin</strong>: Josie’s odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom
court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of
the night.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - continuous</strong>: WE PAN ACROSS
the dance floor where we see POPEYE &amp; OLIVE OYL, SONNY &amp; CHER,
the BLUES BROTHERS. WE HOLD on ROBIN dancing with BATGIRL. BATMAN
approached and taps Robin’s shoulder–</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: May I have this dance- And Batgirl steps
aside–Robin and Batman dance happily away. ANGLE ON ROB trying to slow
dance with Tracy , but she is so-drunk she’s having trouble
balancing.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Are you having fun?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah. Definitely. He tries to stand her up on
her own.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Good. Gibby gave me champagne.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Maybe we should sit. He helps her to a chair
next to the dance floor. They both sit. Next to them, a ravenous MISS
PIGGY eats with her date KERMIT looking on. She picks up an hors
d’oeuvre and stares at it horrified.</p>
<p><strong>miss piggy</strong>: Oh my God! Is this a pig in a blanket?!
Tracy looks at Rob, and gets serious.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Rob, I’ve - I’ve thought about it a lot. And
I think- I mean, I know. You’re the one. My penguin. Rob looks at her.
She’s young. She’s beautiful. She’s tipsy. She’s trying to put her legs
behind her head.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Wow - I-</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me
and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let’s have sex. He looks around.
It’s high school prom. A skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner.
Other kids are sneaking smokes. He can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I’m gonna get you some water. And then, I think
we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie. Rob gets up,
kisses Tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment
table. Tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into
Kermit’s lap. Kermit looks down, surprised and interested. Miss Piggy
notices, gives him a big “Harumph”, tosses her hair, and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>angle back on: the cool table.</strong>: Gibby is staring
O.S. in horror.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: You guys–what is the one thing that could
ruin my senior prom?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: That you would trip on your Barbie heels
and I’d get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud? WE FOLLOW
Kristen’s stare to the prom entrance where Aldys and the Denominators
enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to
form a human ladder. They cross the dance floor, interrupting everything
with their unwieldy, tied-together conga line. They approach the Cool
Table.</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: So what are you supposed to be? Other than
freaks?</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: We’re DNA. A double helix. But I guess you’d
know that if you’d actually passed bio. Kristen reaches out and touches
the rope binding Denominator #1 to Aldys. Denominator #1 slaps her hand
away.</p>
<p><strong>denominator #1</strong>: Please don’t touch the hydrogen.
It’s rented. Kristen reacts.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - on the stage � later</strong>: Sam
takes the stage, with a card in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, the moment has arrived. He looks at the

Kristen Rey, Miss Kirsten Leosis and Miss Gibby Zarefsky. And the
princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob - Sam looks
at the card, and then looks around. Nobody can help him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Rob … Mr. Rob! The crowd cheers. Gibby,
Kirsten, and Kristen all jump in preplanned delight. Rob seems genuinely
surprised. Jason carries Tommy up to the stage piggyback. The girls make
their way to the stage, and put on their “PROM COURT” sashes. Sam looks
to the card again.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Next up - Southglen’s Prom King� Guy is already
halfway to the stage-</p>

money.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - continuous-</strong>: Josie is
hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, elated, to the stage. Sam
places the Queen’s tiara on her head and hands her a bouquet of flowers.
They lock eyes for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And now - as it is custom - the king and queen
will have their first dance.</p>
<p><strong>on the dance floor:</strong>: Guy and Josie begin to dance.
From Josie’s P.O.V., it’s in SLOW MOTION, the world glittering and
wonderful around her.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey–what are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Shakespeare. How he described a night like
this–“Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of
bright gold”. What about you? What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My sword. It’s like a switch has been flicked
on in Josie’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Josie, you rock my world. You’re like the most
amazing girl I’ve ever dated. You’re so smart and fun and crazy! You
rock my world.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You said that already.</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - buffet - minutes later</strong>:
Josie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face
with Sam. They’re both taken aback by the other’s beauty.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Josie–you make a really beautiful prom
queen.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Thanks. So do you. They both laugh,
embarrassed, at Josie’s flub.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I always feel like such a goofball in these
penguin suits. Like I’m at my own wedding or something. An awkward
beat.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You wanna– He gestures towards the dance floor.
Josie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, okay– And they walk off onto the dance
floor.</p>
<p><strong>angle on: the side of the dance floor.</strong>: Guy
approaches Aldys.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, listen–it’s prom. How about we let all the
old shit go. Would you like to dance? Aldys can’t help it. She smiles, a
little flattered.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: If it’s okay with the rest of the double helix.
Aldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group. And starts to dance
with Guy.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: JOSIE AND SAM as they continue to
dance.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Proms always make me sad. They’re so final.
Graduation. Everyone’s scattering, moving on.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, are you here with anybody?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, I’m alone.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s weird because “prom” is actually from
the word “promenade”. And you can’t really promenade alone, can you? Sam
smiles at this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re amazing, Josie Geller.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: GUY AND ALDYS as they dance, WE SEE the
Cool Girls and Jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing
Gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a CAN OF ALPO. She hands it
to Jason who pulls a CAN OPENER out of his pocket, opens the lid. He
hands it to Kirsten who take the lid off. She hands the can to Kristen,
who hands the can to Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So–have you thought anymore about
Dartmouth?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, I have. CLOSE UP on Josie’s HAND as she
subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: There’s something I have to tell you– Her
foot comes down on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>interior. george’s van - continuous</strong>: George is
making out with his Date when the monitor suddenly FRITZES OFF. George
looks up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the–?! George stands and hits the side
of the monitor.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - continuous</strong>: Gus’s monitor
flicks to static. The Crowd lets out a horrified GASP.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Tell him what?! Tell him what?!</p>
<p><strong>interior. country club - dance floor - continuous</strong>:
Sam looks deep into Josie’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There’s something I have to tell you, too–
Josie’s eyes shift from Sam to over his shoulder. She spots Aldys, who
smiles at her. Josie’s eyes travel up to the can of DOG FOOD.</p>
<p><strong>flash: teenage josie</strong>: on the porch, facing Billy and
his Date.</p>
<p><strong>flash: teenage josie</strong>: with egg dripping all over
her.</p>
<p><strong>nooooooo!</strong>: SLOW MOTION as Josie lunges for Aldys and
pulls her to floor as Tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down
Guy’s front. The Crowd stops dead, staring. The can, now empty, rolls
slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise ECHOING in the
silence.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What is your problem?!</p>
<p><strong>gibby</strong>: I knew it. You are a loser.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: You ruined the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Everyone is still staring. It’s dead quiet.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Let me tell you something. It is still
silent. Josie takes a deep breath, and looks around the room.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t care about being the prom queen. I am
twenty five years old. Looks of confusion and teenage disgust. Rob is
pissed. Sam looks shocked.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m here as an undercover reporter for the
Sun Times for God’s sake and I’ve been beating my brains out trying to
impress you. She tears off her crown, and chucks it. She’s on a
roll.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I want to tell you something. You people-
Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through
the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep
others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss
out on so much. Why her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell
you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and
she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my
friends only after my brother, Rob… She points out Rob in the crowd.
He’s mortified.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: posed as a student and told you to like me.
But y’know–l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to
be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good. But not as good as being
myself. And to all of you– there’s a big world out there. Bigger than
prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won’t matter if
you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school.
What matters is that you don’t regret who you were, who you are-What if
Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn’t
“cool”? What if Rosie O’Donnell had stopped cracking jokes because
someone told her they were stupid? What if Michael Jordan never went
back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?. In this
room right now, there could be a future Nobel Prize winner, a Supreme
Court Justice, an amazing Mom. Find out who you are and don’t be afraid
of it. And if you’ll all excuse me, I have some business to take care
of. Reaction shots’ all around. Kids start clapping, hollering,
whooping. The MUSIC STARTS UP again. They all go back to dancing The
Denominators lead their own conga line.</p>
<p><strong>angle on: josie</strong>: She looks around for Sam but he is
gone. She runs out, brushing past the Judges.</p>
<p><strong>angle on: judges</strong>: Judge #2 dabs his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>judge #1</strong>: This prom had it all. Laughter, tears, an
amazing climax. Judge #2, still overcome, just raises his “two thumbs
up.”</p>
<p><strong>exterior. country club parking lot - moments later</strong>:
Josie exits the club, looking for Sam. George runs up to her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey–I lost the feed! What happened with
Coulson? Gus is going crazy! Out of the shadows emerges Sam. The look on
his face says he just heard everything.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: So–surprise! He shakes his head in disbelief
and walks off. Josie chases after him. He turns back to her.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Surprise!” you were doing a story on me?!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No, surprise, I thought you’d be–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all
along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You were attracted to me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any
idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to
a 17 year old! When I wasn’t taking cold showers, I was trying to figure
out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn’t teach anymore! I
thought I was the one being unethical.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wait, I was going to tell you–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You set me up. For a story. You know what’s
crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: But now you don’t have to–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now I don’t want to! I bought all of your
penguin crap. I thought I found her–the right one! And the problem was
she was too young! No - the problem was–she didn’t even exist!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I did exist. I do exist. I’m the same
person!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The person I cared about wouldn’t have done
this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don’t know
you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t! Look, you could get to know me,
again. Sam turns and starts to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Please. Please don’t walk away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I just can’t look at you the same way. Sam gets
into his car and drives off. Josie is devastated.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment building - hallway -
later</strong>: Josie, still in the prom dress, rounds the corner of her
apartment hallway and sees Rob, still in his Risky Business get-up,
slumped in front of the door.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and
make sure you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Really? He gets up. He’s not happy.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could
you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And
how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come
to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn’t have
given a shit about my age.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I wasn’t even thinking about-</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, you weren’t. Don’t you realize the only
time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing
ball with those guys?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up. He storms
off.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s bedroom - later that night</strong>: Josie
lies amidst the needlepoint pillows, still in her prom costume. She
stares blankly at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’s office - day</strong>: Gus slaps a newspaper
down on his desk. CLOSE ON - the front page of the paper, and not just
any newspaper - THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE - the Sun Times’ rival. There is a
PHOTO of Josie from Prom with the headline that reads: “REPORTER
REVEALED AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL”. Josie picks it up, and starts
reading.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Your story was Rigfort’s baby. We were scooped!
We’ve got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of
us.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell
him the whole story.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’ll tell you a story. It’s about this shy copy
editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely
botches her first assignment as a reporter. Josie stands. Slams down the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: We are not screwed. Yes, I made a mistake.
But we will have a story. You will have an amazing story. Josie
exits.</p>
<p><strong>interior. sun times bullpen - continuous</strong>: Josie
walks out of Gus’s office, continues, determined, towards the elevators.
Anita falls into step with her.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: Josie! Josie, how’d it go? Did he ream
you?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yeah, but I’m okay. I’ve got some work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: You need my help?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No, thanks–I’m doing this on my own. Josie
walks past Merkin’s desk. She holds out her hand to Merkin.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Merkin. Highlighter. Merkin slaps a
highlighter into her hand, she continues on. Anita watches her go.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. southglen high school - day</strong>: Josie,
looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase, bounds
up the steps, two at a time.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - same</strong>: Josie walks
down the hall, purposefully - she is on a mission. Groups of kids stop
and stare at her, but this time, Josie doesn’t even notice. As Josie
rounds a corner, she comes face to face with Guy, who is at his locker.
He looks at her. She smiles. And now it is Guy that is nervous. He drops
a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. Josie looks at him -
and for the first time we see it register on her face - this guy is just
a seventeen- year-old kid.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Uh, hey, umm–Ms. Geller. This is totally
embarrassing but my mom, she’s all worried about me getting a job after
graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me,
at the Sun Times? Josie smiles big.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’ll do what I can. And tell your mom not to
worry - you’ll do O.K. Josie continues down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>interior. locker room - same</strong>: The guys’ locker room.
A bunch of GUYS are getting dressed after P. E.</p>
<p><strong>woman coming through! cover up what you don’t want
seen!</strong>: And with that Josie comes walking into the locker room,
completely unruffled, and storms over to Coach Romano’s office, just as
he is leaving it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi, Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller,
from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the
Sun Times, Jim Lakin?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Sure, every coach in the area tries to get
Jim to cover his team. Josie puts her arm around the coach, and leads
him back into his own office.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, what would you say if I told you that I
could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be
at the game?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: I’d say you can have whatever the hell you
want. Josie smiles, together they enter his office and close the
door.</p>
<p><strong>interior. josie’s apartment - day</strong>: Josie sits at her
disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Someone once told me that to write well you
have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years
old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my
childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>interior. gus’ office - day</strong>: Gus comes in, snaps on
the light, sits at his desk, and opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the
“Life and Style” section. And there it is. Front page - “NEVER BEEN
KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER.” There are three pictures next to the article.
One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, and one is her
as a normal, 25 yr. old adult.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: High school was more of the same. Then, at
seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy
in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a
cruel joke. I have never fully recovered.</p>
<p><strong>interior. sun times luhchrooh - day</strong>: Anita and
Cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch room, over a shared bag of
microwave popcorn. They are astounded-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes, it is embarrassing to share this with
the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I
learned it, without sharing this humiliating history.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. a house - morning</strong>: The Sun Times lies on
the front mat. The door opens; we see a pair of bare feet. A hand
reaches down to grab the paper. WE PAN UP to reveal Sam in all his
depressed glory–sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I received an assignment, my first as a
reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight
into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst
nightmare. Sam shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. southglen high school - day</strong>: Kids stream
into school.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What I found?</p>
<p><strong>interior. mrs. knox’s ciassroom - day</strong>: Mrs. Knox,
wearing the sombrero, teaches her class.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: There’s still that one teacher, who marches
to her own drummer- And in the back row, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby are
laughing an talking–</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Those girls are still there. The ones that,
even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you’ve
ever seen close up.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball diamond - day</strong>: The BASEBALL TEAM
as they practice-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: The athletes - and the immense sense of
fraternity and loyalty that they share-</p>
<p><strong>interior. science lab - day</strong>: Aldys and the
Denominators- making smores over a bunson burner getting into a melted
chocolate and marshmallow fight- and laughing hysterically-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: The smart kids. Who everyone else always knew
as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my
friends.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. parking lot - day</strong>: Guy, Tommy and Jason,
as they get out Guy’s car, in the parking lot-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And there’s still that one guy, the one who
is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders-</p>
<p><strong>exterior. high school - day</strong>: We focus in on Guy, as
he takes the front steps two at a time-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: - to the way he, in his own way, struggles to
uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him.
High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the
same without him.</p>
<p><strong>interior. high school hallway - day</strong>: Guy, his
buddies, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, sign yearbooks, hang out by the
lockers-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: All of these things made me miserable at
seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is
just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A
time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us.
A time that makes us who we are, for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. newsstand - day</strong>: HANDS grab Chicago Sun
Times at the newsstand-</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: High school- going through it the first time-
helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that
who I am is O.K. I always wanted to be “in”, but seven years later, when
they finally opened the door, I somehow gained the confidence to stay
outside, firmly, happily.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. “el” train platform - day</strong>: About 75% of
the people have their Life and Style sections opened, reading Josie’s
piece.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: This is not the article I was sent in to
write. This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of
regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second,
my regrets are down to one.</p>
<p><strong>interior. sam’s kitchen - morning</strong>: The kitchen of a
depressed guy–empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant. Sam pours milk
into a bowl of Lucky Charms while he reads the Sports Section of the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: A certain teacher was trampled in my path to
self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no
way makes up for what I did to him. He’s not paying attention and the
milk overflows the bowl, soaking the table.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: To this man, you know who you are, I am so
sorry. He takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up the
remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash can. He leaves
the kitchen. WE HOLD ON the empty room.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And, I would like to add one more thing - I
think I am in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball, stadium parking lot � night</strong>:
Cars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And so I propose this - as an ending to this
article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie
Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game � where my
friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. baseball field - night</strong>: The Southglen Rams
baseball team minus Rob, are on the field, warming up.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I will stand on the pitcher’s mound for the
five minutes prior to the first pitch. If this man accepts my apology, I
ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real
kiss. We find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Five minutes may seem like a short time, but
trust me, when you’ve been waiting twenty-five years, it’s usually the
last five minutes that kill you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I went back to high school and discovered I
was a loser, again. WIDEN TO REVEAL the picture on the fridge in–</p>
<p><strong>interior. sam’s kitchen - evening</strong>: Sam enters, still
in sweats, carrying a book. He opens the fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it,
is confronted by Josie’s picture. He takes it down, looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: And then I discovered it wasn’t so bad. I
wasn’t so bad. So, now that I’m ready to start living the rest of my
life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him. Sam
lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Because inside everyone is a loser afraid to
be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it
all better. WE FOLLOW Sam’s stare down into the trash and see the photo
lying on top and to the side of Josie’s article–the photos from the
article are clearly visible. ANGLE ON HOT DOGS, POPCORN CHANGING HANDS
being sold by the truckload at the stadium. The crowds are over
capacity. Way over. People fill the parking lot, they cover every other
inch of school grounds, as well. They stand on the roofs of nearby
buildings, they sit on top of their cars. It looks like most of Chicago
is either already there, or on their way. Some WOMEN hold signs for
Josie, others hold and wave her article. Josie sticks her head out of
the dugout, and looks out at the fans. TV REPORTERS are everywhere,
including several on the field. She looks like she may faint. She ducks
back in.</p>
<p><strong>interior. dugout - same</strong>: The team is dressed, ready,
excited. Anita and Aldys stand next to Josie. Josie looks up at the
crowd, amazed.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Wow. It’s packed.</p>
<p><strong>anita</strong>: It’s great! They’re behind you. They feel
like they know you.</p>
<p><strong>aldys</strong>: It’s romantic, what you’re doing, and they
want to be a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well I’m so glad that you guys are. Josie
then starts to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her ankles.
Anita and Aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to Josie. She
hyperventilates into it. Coach Romano approaches. Josie puts the bag
down.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Sweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there’d
be all these TV crews here. This thing’s gonna be on every station in
the country. Josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag
again.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You more than kept your end of the bargain.
Now go out there and get ’em. Josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass.
She hugs Aldys. Then Anita gives Josie a big hug, and won’t let go.
Josie has to pull Anita pulls back. Josie struggles to get out of the
hug- Anita won’t let her. Finally, they are both laughing. Josie walks
out of the dugout, and onto the field.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. pitcher’s mound - same</strong>: She walks, alone,
out to the pitcher’s mound, clutching a microphone. The crowd goes
berserk. She stands until they quiet.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Could I have five minutes on the clock,
please? The scoreboard clock reads 5:00. Josie stands, alone.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. box seats � same</strong>: The staff from the Sun
Times sits in box seats up front. Rigfort joins them, carrying a huge
load of hot dogs.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: I got weiners. Hot weiners. Rigfort sits
next to Gus. Behind them sit Bruns, his hair finally growing in and
Howard, now down to just a sling.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: I love this. Sun Times readers, out here,
making a personal connection to one of our reporters. This is amazing,
isn’t it? Weiner? Gus takes a weiner.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Wait a minute… Rigfort pulls something
small and shiny out of the bun.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: There’s a bolt in my weiner. Then he turns
back to Howard and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>rigfort</strong>: Hey Howard, what are you doing for the next
month? Howard’s face falls.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. pitcher’s mound - same</strong>: Josie still stands
there. The clock is down to 2:30. She looks over to the dugout.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. bleachers - same</strong>: The Denominators talking
and laughing. Behind them, sit the Marching Band</p>
<p><strong>exterior. pitcher’s mound � same</strong>: Josie forces-a
stoic smile. 1:00 is on the clock.</p>

there, head still held high.</p>
<p><strong>five - four - three - two -</strong>: Josie steals a look to
the dugout. No one is coming out the door.</p>
<p><strong>one!!</strong>: Josie makes one more desperate look around.
No one is running toward her. CLOSE UP on Josie, completely crestfallen.
She drops the microphone. It reverbs in the silent stadium. WE PAN
ACROSS the Crowd, all defeated. And then… A commotion in the stands. Sam
bursts through the crowd. He runs toward the mound. The Crowd is on
their feet. It feels like a lifetime before he reaches Josie, grabs her,
pulls her close to him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I told you you could write, Josie Geller.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I finally found my story. And they kiss
passionately. The most amazing, most waited-for kiss in the history of
man. A kiss that will last forever.</p>
<p><strong>interior. dugout - same</strong>: Rob is in his baseball

<p><strong>exterior. bleachers - same</strong>: Guy, Kirsten, etc. have

the CAMERA PULLS UP, taking in the kiss, the Crowd, the stadium… CAMERA
