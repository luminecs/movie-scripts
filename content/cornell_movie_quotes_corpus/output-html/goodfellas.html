<p><strong>hood</strong>: Billy. You look beautiful. Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>baits</strong>: What are you having? Give ’em what they’re
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Billy, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Son of a bitch. Get over here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen to him. “Watch the suit,” he says. A
little pisser I’ve known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don’t go get too
big.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t go busting my balls. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Busting his balls? If I was busting your
balls, I’d send you home for your shine box.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You remember Tommy’s shines? The kid was
great. He made mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No more shines, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We’re only kidding.
You can’t take a joke? Come ooonn.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Now get the hell home and get your shine
box.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, relax. He’s drunk. He’s been locked
up for six years.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t give a shit. That guy’s got no
right.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy. He. doesn’t mean anything. Forget
about it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He’s insulting me. Rat bastard. He’s never
been any fuckin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy. Come on. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Keep him here. I’m going for a bag.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Batts. I’m sorry. Tommy gets loaded. He
doesn’t mean any disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>batts</strong>: He’s got a hot head.</p>
<p><strong>batts</strong>: They’re fucking mutts.</p>
<p><strong>butts</strong>: I seen them. They walk around like big shots
and they don’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A guy gets half a load on. He mouths off.</p>
<p><strong>batts</strong>: When I was a kid, I swear on my mother, you
mouth off, you got your fucking legs broke.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Quick! Lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are we going to do with him? We can’t
dump him in the street.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Bring the car round back. I know a place
Upstate they’ll never find him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I didn’t want to get blood on your floor.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Batts’s made. His whole crew is going to be
looking for him. This is fucking bad.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There’s a shovel at my mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: SSHHH. You’ll wake ’er up.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Have some more. Yon hardly touched anything.
Did Tommy tell you about my painting? Look.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: They want me to do a portrait next. I’m
gonna do the Moan Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jesus Christ! Miserable bastard!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can you believe this no-good fuck? The prick!
He’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Rat bastard. No-good, low-life fuck.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As far back as I can remember, I always
wanted to be a gangster.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: To me, being a gangster was better than being
President of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Even before I first wandered into the
cabstand for an after-school job, I knew I wanted to be a part of them.
It was there I belonged.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: To me it meant being somebody in a
neighborhood full of nobodies.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They weren’t like anyone else. They did
whatever they wanted. They’d double-park in front of the hydrant and
nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer when they played cards all
night, nobody ever called the cops.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a pizzeria
and a few other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss over
everybody in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie might have moved slow, but it was only
because he didn’t have to move for anybody.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: At first, my parents loved that I found a job
across the street. My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age
of eleven, and he liked that I got myself a job. He always said American
kids were spoiled lazy.</p>
<p><strong>carmella</strong>: Come on. Come on. You’ll all be late.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And my mother was happy after she found out
that the Varios came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my
mother, it was the answer to her prayers.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was the luckiest kid in the world.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I could go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I could do anything.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I knew everybody and everybody knew me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But it wasn’t too long before my parents
changed their minds. For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a
part-tie job, but for me, it was full-time.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: People like my father could never understand,
but I was a part of something. I belonged. I was treated like a
grown-up. Every day I was learning to score.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Did you study hard in school today? Did you
learn a lot? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I can’t hear you, you little liar. I got
this from the school. They say you haven’t been there in months.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Little lying bastard.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: My father was always pissed off. He was
pissed that he had to work so hard. He was pissed that he made such
lousy money. Be was pissed that there were seven of us living in a tiny
house. But after a while, he was mostly pissed that I hung around the
cabstand. He said they were bums and that I was a bum. He said I was
going to get into trouble. I used to say I was only running errands
after school, but he knew better. He knew what went on at the cabstand
and, every once in a while, usually after he got his load on, I had to
take a beating. But by then, I didn’t care. No matter how many beatings
I took, I wouldn’t listen to what he said. I don’t think I even heard
him. The way I saw it, everybody has to take a beating some time.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I can’t make any more deliveries.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: Whadda you mean, you can’t make any more
deliveries? You’re going to fuck up everything?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: My father got a letter from the school. He
said the next time he’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>hood #1</strong>: Is that the one?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: NO.</p>
<p><strong>hood �2</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No. There. That’s him. That’s the guy.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: You know this kid?</p>
<p><strong>mailman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tuddy</strong>: You know where he lives?</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: You deliver mail to his house?</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: From now on, any letters to the kid from his
school come directly here. Do you understand? One more letter from the
school to the kid’s house and …</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: … you’re going in the oven head- first.</p>
<p><strong>renky</strong>: That was it. No more letters from truant
officers. No more letters from school. In fact, no more letters from
anybody. How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance
to the flag and sit through good government bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie and he
got a piece of everything they made. It was tribute, just like the old
country, except they were doing it in America. All they got from Paulie
was protection from other guys looking to rip them off. That’s what it’s
all about. That’s what the FBI can never understand – that what Paulie
and the organization does is offer protection for people who can’t go to
the cops. They’re like the police department for wiseguys.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: I’ll be up at the corner.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: People locked at me differently. They knew I
was with somebody.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I didn’t have to wait on line at the bakery
on Sunday morning anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was
with, and he’d come from around the counter, no matter how many people
were waiting. I was taken care of first.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Our neighbors didn’t park in our driveway
anymore, even though we didn’t have a car. At thirteen, I was making
more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood. I had more
money than I could spend. I had it all.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: One day some of the kids from the
neighborhood carried my mother’s groceries all the way home for her. It
was out of respect.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My God! You look like a gangster.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ve been shot! Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>tuddy</strong>: Close the door. Don’t let him in.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s okay. It’s okay. They’re getting an
ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was the first time I had ever seen anyone
shot.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: You’re some fucking jerk.</p>
<p><strong>toddy</strong>: I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that
guy. :</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I
remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right. I knew Paulie didn’t want
anybody dying in the building.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was a glorious time. Wiseguys were all
over the place. It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joey decided to
take on a boss and start a war. It was when I met the world. It was when
I first met Jimmy Burke.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He couldn’t have been more than twenty-four
or twenty-five at the time, but he was already a legend. He’d walk in
the door and everybody who worked the room went wild. He’d give the
doorman a hundred just for opening the door. He shoved hundreds in the
pockets of the dealers and who ran the games. The bartender got a
hundred just for keeping the ice cubes cold.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, kid! Get me a seven and seven.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Henry. Say hello to Jimmy Burke.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Keep ’em coming.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the
city. He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses
when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what
he really loved to do was steal. I mean, he actually enjoyed it. Jimmy
was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies. He was
one of the city’s biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze.
Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They
went fast.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And almost all of them were gimmie’s.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They called him Jimmy the Gent. The drivers
loved him. They used to tip him off about the really good loads. Of
course, everybody got a piece. And when the cops assigned a whole army
to stop him, Jimmy made them partners.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tommy. Help the lady.</p>
<p><strong>school-crossing guard</strong>: Thank you, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Say hello to Tommy. You’ll do good
together.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Anything good?</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>detective #2</strong>: Where did you get these cigarettes?
It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Councilor, proceed.</p>
<p><strong>chords of hoods</strong>: You broke your cherry! You broke
your cherry!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: By the time I grew up, there was thirty
billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport and we tried to
steal every bit of it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’ve got to understand, we grew up near the
airport.. It belonged to Paulie. We had friends and relatives who worked
all over the place and they tipped as off about what was coming in and
what was going out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: If any of the truckers or airlines gave as
trouble, Paulie had his people scare then with a little strike. It was
beautiful. It was an even bigger money-major than numbers, and Jimmy was
in charge. Whenever we needed money, we’d rob the airport. To us, it was
better than Citibank.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hurry, gimme the phone. Two niggers just
stole my track.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There was Jimmy and Tommy and me. And there
was Anthony Stabile, Angelo Sepe, Fat Andy, Frankie the Wop, Freddy No
Nose, Pete the Killer, Nicky Blanda, Mikey Franzese, and Johnny Echoes,
who got that nickname because he said everything twice. Like*, “You
wanna get the papers, get the papers.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sonny, we got the coats.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: You got any suits?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Not till Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I need suits.</p>
<p><strong>henry, jimmy, tommy, and assorted hoods and their</strong>:
GIRLFRIENDS</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For us to live any other way was nuts. To us,
those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks, who
took the subway to work every day and worried about their bills, were
dead. They were suckers. They had no balls. If we wanted something, we
just took it. If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never
complained again. It was routine. You didn’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>frenchy</strong>: It’s all there. I can get you past the
alarms and I can get the key.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s okay. Put it on the tab.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Tommy, it’s not just this. Tommy, please.
It’s seven grand here.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Tommy, I need the money, Tommy, please. I owe
the world.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You Sonofabitch fuck. Are you calling me a
deadbeat? The money I spent here? Embarrassing me in front of my
friends. You miserable fuck. Can you believe this bastard? Ungrateful
fuck! I oughta break your fucking legs!</p>
<p><strong>frenchy</strong>: Hey, Tommy. Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: If you knew those fucking kids. They’re nuts.
Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: But I’m worried. I’m hearing all kinds of
things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I’ve always done the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You think that matters? You think they give a
shit about anything? The little bastards.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: But it isn’t right, Paulie. That Tommy, he’s
making trouble for me all over town. I can’t go here. I can’t go
there.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You? You think you’re the only one? I’ve
talked to them a million times, but they don’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: But, Paulie, please.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Someday they’ll get what’s coming to them.
That’s the only way they’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Paulie, I swear, I’m afraid. The guy’s nuts.
What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: What can I do? If I could do something, don’t
you think I would?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tell him. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I was thinking that maybe you could come in
with me. Take a piece of the place. If you were with me, maybe than
they’d have to lay off.</p>
<p><strong>vasio</strong>: What, do I need …</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I mean it. We could do good.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You want a partner?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Now the guy’s got Paulie for a partner. Any
problems, he goes to Paulie. Trouble with the bill? He can go to Paulie.
Trouble with the cops? Deliveries? Tommy? He can call Paulie.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But now the guy has got to come up with
Paulie ’s money every week, no matter what. Business bad? Fuck you, pay
me. You had a fire? Fuck you, pay ma. The place got hit by lighting?
Fuck you, pay me. Also, Paulie could do anything. Especially run up
bills on the joint’s credit. Why not? Nobody’s gonna pay for it
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As soon as the deliveries are made in the
front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount.
You take a two hundred dollar case of booze and sell it for a hundred.
It doesn’t matter. It’s all profit.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And, finally, when there’s nothing 1 left,
when you can’t borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of
booze, you bust the joint out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You light a match.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you
about? Diana? She’s from the Five Towns. She’s Jewish. She won’t go out
with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She’s fucking prejudiced, but
she’s built. She’s never been out with an Italian before. She says
she’ll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend. You believe
this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Will you get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is it my fault she won’t go out without her
girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don’t even have to stay. Jeesuz!
What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy …</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I swear you don’t have to do nothing. You
just show up and then leave. What do you think, I want you around? All I
need is for you to get me started.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven
o’clock and here I am a back-up guy.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Have more coffee. It’ll wake you up.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I couldn’t wait to get away. I was ordering
the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Isn’t she great? Isn’t this great? Let’s do
it tomorrow night? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I couldn’t stand him. I thought he was really
obnoxious. He kept fidgeting around.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Before it was even time to go home he was
pushing me into the car …</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: … and then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.
But Diana and Tommy had made us promise to meet them again on Friday
night. We agreed. Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood
me up.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: We were a trio instead of double- date that
night, but I made Tommy take me looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’ve got some nerve. Standing me up. Nobody
does that to me. Who do you think you are? A big shot?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I didn’t know, I swear. I thought it was next
week.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Liar!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Take it easy. We can talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: She’s screaming on the street and I mean
loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she’s
screaming, but mostly I’m looking at her eyes. They were just like
Elizabeth Taylor’s. That’s what everybody said.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Talk? To you? After what you did!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I thought you were going to stand me up. You
looked bored. You didn’t say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was
all over me. Right?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, let me make it up.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Button year shirt, quick! Hurry</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ma, this is my friend, Henry Hill.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My daughter says you’re half-Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’re you doing? What about the car?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He watches it for me. It’s better than
waiting at a garage.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You gave them twenty dollars each?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: This is from Mister Tony, over there.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Where, over there?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Over there, over there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m in construction.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They don’t feel like you’re in
construction.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m a union delegate.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Air France made me. We walked out with four
hundred and twenty thousand dollars without a gun. And we did the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: It’s a lot of money for a kid. If anyone
asks, just say you won it shooting crap.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No. No. You’ve got to sign for it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He lives across the street.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: One night Billy Daniels sent us champagne.
There was nothing like it. I didn’t think that there was anything
strange in any of this – you know, a twenty-one-year-old kid with such
connections.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He was an exciting guy. He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody. Everybody wanted to be nice to him. And
he knew how to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>int. marty krugman’s queens bouevard wig and beauty salon
-</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>marty’s tv</strong>: They’ll stay put even in a typhoon. And
I should know. I’m the president of the company.”</p>
<p><strong>marty.</strong>: Jimmy’s busting my chops. Okay, give ’em
eight to five on Cleveland. He wants three points over the vig. From me?
I don’t believe this shit?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Marty. Please. You know Jimmy. You borrowed
his money. Pay ’em.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I didn’t agree to three points over the vig.-
What am I nuts? I didn’t need it that much.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are you gonna do? Fight with him? He
wants his money.</p>
<p><strong>majkty</strong>: Fuck ’em. I never paid points. I always did
the right thing. Did I ever bust his balls? Did I? Did I? I could have
dropped a dime a million times, and I wouldn’t have had to pay dick.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Marty, you’re talking crazy. Drop a dime?
Call the cops? Don’t even let anybody hear such bullshit. Hey don’t you
just pay the man his money and shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You got money for your bullshit television,
don’t you? I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night
long, don’t I? You got money for that, but you don’t have my money?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy. He’ll be okay. He’s good for it.
Relax.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Wait there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ve known him all my life. He just started
grabbing at me. He wouldn’t stop. And when I hit him across the nose
with my shoe, he got mad and shoved me over.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go inside. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Get inside!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey! Fucko! You want something?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: HELP! Police! He’s got a gun! Police!
Quick! Murder!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Here, hold this.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know there are women, like my best friends,
who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them
a gun to hide. “Fha! You and your gun. Get out of here, who needs you?”
That’s what they would have said to him. But I didn’t. I’ve got to admit
the truth. It turned me on.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It was like he had two families. The first
time I was introduced to them all at once, it was crazy. Paulie and his
brothers had lots of sons and nephews and almost all of them were named
Peter or Paul. It was unbelievable. There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding. Plus, they were all married to girls
named Marie, and they named all their daughters Marie. By the time I
finished meeting everybody. I thought I was drunk.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Here. This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Paulie, you shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My bag. My bag.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What bag?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The bag with the envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh that. Don’t worry about that. Nobody’s
gonna steal it.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: He didn’t call?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s with his friends.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: What kind of person doesn’t
call?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s a grown man. Be doesn’t have to call
every five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: If he was so grown up he’d get you
two an apartment.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t bring that up. You’re the one who
wanted us here.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Look. He’s got the whole house in an
uproar.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: He’s got your father upset. Good
thing he doesn’t have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he
deserves?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ma! Please! You’re driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Driving you crazy? Don’t get me
started. You’re here a month and sometimes I know he doesn’t come home
at all. What kind of people are these?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Do? What can you do? What did you
expect? He wasn’t Jewish. Did you know bow they live? Your father would
never stay out this late without calling. In thirty years he never
stayed out all night.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Where were you? Where have you been?
Why didn’t you call? We were all worried to death! A married man doesn’t
stay out like this!</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Normal people don’t live this
way.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - jimmy and mickey’s archie-bunker house
-</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: We weren’t married to nine-to-five guys, but
the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess
party.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Angie, sweetheart, you want it fluff?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: He’s the one with the hands. I’d like to
smack his face.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: The red-haired guy? He looks a like a
farmer?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Sonofabitch. I swear. You can’t go through
the gate without his hands. I told him. Keep’ your fucking hands off,
you Sonofabitch, or I’ll cut them off.</p>
<p><strong>angie)</strong>: He don’t know bow lucky he is. It I just
mentioned it to Vince, I don’t even want to know.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: That’s the problem. How can you mention
it? Vince ’d kill him.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: You think I don’t know? You think I like to
keep this inside? But I gotta, or he’ll kill the miserable bastard and
he’ll be there for life. It’s disgusting what you have to put up
with.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Look at Jeannie’s kid.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: What? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: The oldest one. He was in an argument. A
lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The
kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he’s been
arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now
Jeannie’s got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral
parlor.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: But he was always a bad kid, that one.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: No. Come on. It was the younger one that was
the bad one.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They had bad skin and wore too much makeup. I
mean they didn’t look very good. They looked beat- up.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You never saw teeth like that where I was
growing up and the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap. A lot
of pants suits and double-knits. And they talked about how rotten their
kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts,
but that the kids still didn’t pay any attention. When Henry picked me
up, I was dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I Don’t know. I don’t know if I could live
that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie’s
husband –</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Are you nuts? Jeannie’s husband went to the
can just to get away from her, she’s such a pain in the ass. Let me tell
you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make
themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don’t
have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men.
That’s who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the
getaway car.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Listen, we’re beginning to make real money
for the first time. It’s business. Do you think I’m going to walk away
from that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: After a while, it all got to be normal. None
of it seemed like crimes. It was more that Henry was enterprising. That
he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling, while other men were
sitting on their asses waiting for handouts. Our husbands weren’t brain
surgeons. They were blue collar guys, and the only way they could get
extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And we were also very close. I mean, there
were never any outsiders around. Absolutely never! And being together
all the time made everything seem even more normal.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There was always a little harassment. They
always wanted to talk to Henry about this or that. They’d come with
their subpoenas and warrants and make me sign. But mostly they were just
looking for a handout. A few bucks to keep things quiet, no matter what
they found.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Can I make you some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I always asked them if they wanted coffee.
Some of the wives, like Mickey Burke, used to curse at them and spit on
the floor. Imagine. She’d spit on her own floor. That never made any
sense to me. It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: We did everything together and we were always
the same crowd. Anniversaries. Christenings. We only want to each
other’s houses.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The woman played cards. When my kids were
born. Jimmy and Mickey were always the first at the hospital.</p>

NURSE HOLDS OP A BABY. MICKEY IS IN TEARS.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: When we went to the Islands or Vegas for
vacation, we always . went together.</p>

<p><strong>karen</strong>: It got to ba normal. I got to where I was
even proud that I had the kind of husband who was willing to go out and
risk his neck just to get us the little extras.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But I got my mother to watch the kids
tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I told you I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m gonna need some money.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>(note</strong>: REPLAY THE OPENING OF THE FILM AT 9 TIMES
NORMAL:SPEED – HENRY SLAMMING THE TRUNK CLOSED.)</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For most of the guys, killing got to be
accepted. They were routine. Murder was the only way everybody stayed in
line. It was the ultimate weapon. Yon got out of line, you got whacked.
Everyone knew the rules.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But sometimes, even if people didn’t get out
of line, they’d get whacked. Hits just became a habit for some guys. It
didn’t take anything to get yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Guys would get into arguments over nothing
and before you knew it, one of them was dead. They were shooting each
other all the time. Shooting people was a normal thing. It was no big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You didn’t have to do anything and nobody was
immune. You just had to be there.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But we had a problem with Billy Batts. This
was a touchy thing. Tommy had killed a made man. Billy was a part of the
Bambino crew and untouchable.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Before you could touch a made guy, you had to
have a good reason. There had to be a sit-down. And you better get an
okay, or you’d be the one who got whacked.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Saturday night was for wives, but Friday
night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Last week I saw Sunny Davis. What a
performer. You gotta see him. You gotta catch him. He does imitations I
swear you’d think it was the real people.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Yeah, the way he moves. It’s unbelievable.
I mean, you can understand how a white girl could fall for him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: I don’t mean me. Not me. I just mean, you
can see how some girls could. Like that Swedish girl. You can see how
she fell for him. You can see how he has this, this, personality.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: What did you hear about that thing?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What thing? The Brooklyn thing?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: No. No. The guy from downtown.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The guy from near where Christie used to
live?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: No. The other one. The one who disappeared up
the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh I Him.</p>
<p><strong>vasio</strong>: You know the one I mean?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh yeah. Sure. That guy. I know him.</p>
<p><strong>vasio</strong>: That Batts was a miserable fuck, but his
people are looking still for him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh yeah. Yeah. I know. I even looked into it
myself. Nobody knows what the fuck happened to him. He came in the joint
that one night and then he disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>varzo</strong>: Hell, keep your eyes open. They’re busting my
balls looking for the fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We got a problem, that thing we took care of
upstate?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie was just talking about him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, we gotta dig him up again.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The guy just sold the property. They’re gonna
build condominiums and I don’t want anybody digging up the little
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s been six months.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s still better than letting somebody find
him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: If Paulie finds out, we got problems.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck Paulie. If Batts’ crew finds we whacked
him, we got real problems.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happened to the car? I hit a skunk.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I set up Linda in an apartment around the
corner from the Suite. That way I was able to stay over a couple of
nights a week. Karen was home with the kids anyway and she never asked
any questions anyway.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Linda and I were having so much fun, she
started screwing up at work, and I had to straighten out her boss a
little bit.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Spider. C’mon, get me a seven and seven.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Spider, what did I say? Did I say I was dying
over here? Come on. Move it. Don’t walk, dance. Did you ever see in the
cowboy movies where they make them dance? Did you see The Oklahoma Kid,
the only cowboy movie Cagney ever made? Come on, dance, you varmit.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Tommy, don’t fuck around.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yahooo.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy, don’t fuck around. Put the gun away.
Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, no. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No. It’s okay. Just watch this. Watch it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I gotta go out!</p>
<p><strong>kaben</strong>: Not tonight, you’re not. Not without the car
keys, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t care. Something’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That again.</p>
<p><strong>kaben</strong>: You’re a liar. I look at you and I know
you’re a liar.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I need some air. I need a little peace. At
least at home.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey! Look at this. Fred Astaira, back from
the wars. Can you believe this guy? That bandage. It’s bigger than his
foot.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Spider. You’re so full of shit. Even with
that foot, I bet you can dance.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on. Spider. Come on. Let’s see you
dance.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Why don’t you go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, Spider. That’s very good. Did you hear,
Spider? The kid’s got balls. See, the kid’s got balls. He’s a good
kid.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You going to take that shit from this punk?
This fuckin’ low-life. This kid’s got bigger balls than you’ll have any
day. He just got shot in the foot by you and he tells you to go fuck
yourself. I can’t believe this shit. Can you believe this shit? Tommy!
You gonna take that shit from a punk?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: All right, you dumb fuck, if you’re going to
be a big fuckin’ wiseguy, you can dig the hole.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: After Billy Batts and Spider, everything was
going crazy. Not just our crew, but everybody.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Open up! I know you’re there! You stay away
from my husband.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: She wouldn’t open the door. I rang her bell.
Still, she wouldn’t open. I rang her bell for two hours, and she kept on
hiding.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Henry. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s the matter with you? You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kareh</strong>: Crazy? I’m crazy enough to shoot you and
her.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But still I couldn’t hurt him. How could I
hurt him? I couldn’t even bring myself to leave him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s all bullshit. I swear. It’s nothing.
Whatever you want, we’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt,
I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone
else? Why should she win?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I don’t need this bullshit. I got enough to
worry about getting whacked on the street. I gotta come home to get
whacked?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I swear on my mother, I should kill you.
You’re fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Honey. Go get me some cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Karen’s come to the house. She’s very upset.
It’s no good. You gotta straighten this all out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Things gotta be calm right now, and Karen’s
so high-strung. She’s with Mickey every day. Who knows what she’s gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Jimmy and Tommy were supposed to pick up
something in Tampa for me this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You go with Jimmy, instead. Get away for a
few days. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Enjoy yourselves. Have a good time. Then,
when you get back Monday, you go home to Karen.</p>
<p><strong>mam</strong>: I ain’t got it. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I can’t. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: we’re gonna feed the bastard to the
lions.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What lions? I’m not going near any lions.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We only have to shove’em over the moat.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They must really feed each other to the lions
down there, because the guy gave the money right up and we got to spend
the rest of the weekend at the track. But then, I couldn’t believe what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: When we got home, we were all over the
newspapers. At first, I didn’t even know why we got picked up.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Then, I found out, that the guy we roughed up
turned out to have a sister working as a typist for the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who could believe it? Of all the fucking
people. She gave up everybody. Jimmy. Me. Even her brother.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It took the jury six hours to bring us in
guilty. The judge gave Jimmy and me ten years like he was giving away
candy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy, marty krugman, joe manri, stacks edwards,
frenchy</strong>: McMAHON, etc., are all having drinks with HENRY before
he goes off to prison.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I thought you were supposed to turn yourself
in at ten o’clock this morning?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m just having my last few drinks.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ve been all over town. I got a call from
the bondman. He says they’re going to rescind your bail if you don’t
show up and sign in right now. They’re going to take away the house.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Say hello to Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Okay, now you can take me to jail.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Dinner was always a big thing. We had a pasta
course and then meat or fish. Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a
year for contempt and he had a system for doing garlic. He used a razor
and he sliced it so thin it used to liquify in the pan with a little
oil.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce. I
felt he put in too many onions, but it was a good sauce anyway.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Johnny Dio did the meat. He didn’t have a
broiler, so Johnny did everything in pans. He smelled up the joint
something awful and the hacks used to die.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Everybody else in the joint was doing real
time, all mixed together, living like pigs.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We lived alone, we owned the joint. Even
those hacks who we couldn’t bribe would never rat on the guys who
did.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nice? Good?</p>
<p><strong>varzo</strong>: Okay. What else?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Now we eat.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Are there any more?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No, that’s it. Ho more today.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You son of a bitch. She’s been here.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t lie to me. I saw her name in the
register.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jezuz Christ!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay
up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What am I doing? I’m in here! I’m in jail. I
can’t stop people from coming to see me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You want her? Good! Let her sneak this stuff
in for you!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Let her fight with these creep bastards every
week to make life easier for you!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Let her carry this shit inside.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Nobody’s helping me. Tommy got four years.
Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed
you, and you know what he told me?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He told me to take the kids to the police
station and make the cops put me on welfare.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We’ve got to help each other.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see
him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s only you and me. That’s what happens
when you go away. We’re on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As
long as he’s on parole he doesn’t want anybody doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I can’t do it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes, you can. I’ve got it set up. We’ll be
fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I’ve got a guy
in here from Pittsburgh who’ll move it for me. Believe me, in a month
we’ll be fine. We won’t need anybody.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m afraid. I’m afraid if Paulie finds
out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t worry about Paulie. Is he helping you?
Is he putting food on the table? We’ve got to help ourselves. We just
have to be careful while we do it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t want to hear about her anymore.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Get packed. We’re getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t worry with what. You just start looking
for a new place. I’m going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from
Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and
it’s only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But you’ve got to see your parole officer in
the afternoon and I promised we’d take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t worry about it. You listening to me?
Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: I don’t want any more of that Shit.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Wha? Me?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know
what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Me? Why would I get into that shit?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: I know what you did inside. You did what you
had to do. I’m not talking about that. I’m talking from now on, outside.
I’m talking right here.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why would I get into that?</p>
<p><strong>varzo</strong>: Don’t make me a fool. You know what I mean,
from now on, you gotta be careful. Just don’t mess around with that
shit, and watch out for Jimmy. Jimmy’s a good earner, but he’s sometimes
too hungry. He’s wild. He does foolish things. Jimmy is not a
businessman. As good as he is, he takes too many chances.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I know that. I know Jimmy. You think I’d take
chances like Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>varzo</strong>: And that Tommy. He’s a good kid, but he’s
crazy. He’s a cowboy. He’s got too much to prove. You got to watch out
for kids like that.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie, I know. I know what they are. But I
use them for certain things. Please. Believe me, you don’t nave to
worry.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: I’m not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He’s
seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don’t
need that. I don’t care who it is. I’m warning everybody. Gribbs got
twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking
around selling junk behind his back. That’s not going to happen to me.
You understand?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie. Why would I? I swear.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You’re only home early because we got you a
job, right? And I don’t need any heat. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nods.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: And, if you hear about anybody else fucking
around with that shit, you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nods again.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Anybody! You understand?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It took me about a week of sneaking around
before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff without Paulie finding out.
But when I did, it was a real score. I started using Robin’s place to
mix the stuff and even with Robin’s snorting more than she mixed, I
could see this was a good business. I made twelve thousand dollars in my
second week and I had a down-payment on my house. All I had to do was
every once in a while, tell Robin I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was perfect. As long as I kept getting the
stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out. But within a
couple of weeks it got to be so big I needed help. I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-
one-five.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who’s buying?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Burke?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Still working?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This we had to have made special. I mean, sit
in it. Go ahead. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The others you couldn’t even sit in. And from
here, watch the wall.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: See. It opens. We had the electricians fix it
up special.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This we imported. It came in two pieces.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s a fait accompli?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And Jimmy’s in it, right?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Will you stop.</p>
<p><strong>hasty</strong>: But you don’t understand. It’s worth
millions. It’s once in a</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Lifetime. We’ll be rich. No more nut every
week. I’ve been cultivating this thing for two years.</p>
<p><strong>a seedy mob hangout. we see all of the wiseguys who
will</strong>: BE A PART OF THE LUFTHANSA ROBBERY. MARTY, HENRY, TOMMY,
AND JIMMY ARE WATCHING A BASKETBALL GAME.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And these are the guys.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tommy and Sepe were going to grab the outside
guard and make him get us in the front door.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Frenchy and</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Fat Louis had to keep than tied up and away
from alarms.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Only Marty was driving us nuts. He was
busting Jimmy’s balls for an advance on the money we were going to
steal.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Even Stacks got in on it. He was supposed to
steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours in
Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I had everybody working. Even our old
babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: She’s beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at
her.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hello! Hello! Have a good flight?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I hate Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where’d you find such creeps?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They’re okay and it’s worth it. Ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is this the same one as last time?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. That one was my sister’s. This is
Louise’s.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look at her, Henry, is she sweet? Doesn’t she
look like Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s what the stewardess said.</p>
<p><strong>hehry</strong>: Hey! Watch out.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Stay there.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t start. I told you to clean up. Look at
this place. It’s a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought
you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. There’s enough powder around
here to put us all away.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I hate to do dishes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>radio news broadcaster</strong>: … and nobody knows for sure
just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa
cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport. The FBI says two million dollars.
Port Authority police say four million dollars, the city cops say five.
How much maximum? That they won’t say. So far, Lufthansa has not said
anything, but they’ve promised to break their silence soon with a press
conference, and WINS will be there to cover it live from the scene of
the heist at JFK when they do. It looks like a big one. Maybe the
biggest this town has ever seen. Stay tuned …</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Are you okay? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nothing. I dropped the soap. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come here. Look at this genius.</p>
<p><strong>fat louie</strong>: Come outside. I gotta show you. Just for
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>fat louie</strong>: Is that beautiful? I got it for
Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You fucking nuts? Didn’t I say not to go buy
anything for a while? You got a fucking car?</p>
<p><strong>fat louie</strong>: Don’t get excited. It’s okay. My mother
bought it for us. It’s a wedding present. It’s in her name.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re crazy. The bulls are across the
street. They’re watching everything we do.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jesus Christ! Are you all fucking nuts?</p>
<p><strong>sepe</strong>: What’s the matter with him?</p>
<p><strong>sepe</strong>: Hey? What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sepe</strong>: Angelo! He’s taking my coat! Angelo!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Didn’t I tell you not to get anything big?
Didn’t I tell you not to attract attention? In two days, one fuck buys a
Caddy and another buys a ten thousand dollar mink. Can you believe this
shit? Now get the fuck home and get rid of the coat. Bring it back to
where you got it. I don’t care what you do, just get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sepe</strong>: I’m not giving it back. Angelo? Do you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>sepe</strong>: Did I tell you to shut up? Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fucking guys. Can you believe them. I told
them all: Don’t . attract attention. Act normal.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh! There you are. I’ve been looking all over
for you two.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, I need it, Jimmy. I need it all.</p>
<p><strong>hehry</strong>: Marty. Relax. You saw some money.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But I need it all. I owe people too, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jimmy. Wait. Listen. Please!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I want to talk to Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He heard.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It’s
my share. Jimmy owes me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Marty, please. Let me talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For Christmas. Your share. It’s just a
taste.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We did it. We did it.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey! Look what I got. The most expensive tree
they had.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go buy yourself a coat.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Lufthansa should have been our ultimate
score. The heist of a lifetime. Six million in cash. More than enough to
go around.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey! Stacks! Come on! Open the door! Wake
up!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on! Come on! We got some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: You got coffee?</p>
<p><strong>stacks</strong>: Fucks! You said you had coffee.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Put on a pot.</p>
<p><strong>stacks</strong>: Ball-busting sons of bitches.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Stacks was always crazy. Instead of getting
rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned, went to his
girlfriend’s and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck.
It was all over the television. They even said they came up with prints
off the wheel. It was just a matter of tine before they got to
Stacks.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Give’m a drink.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Have a drink first.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I still gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh yeah? Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s going on? What happened to Stacks? Is
everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There are cops all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So what? Where are they gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s worried.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: ) Come on. Don’t worry so fucking much.
Things are beautiful. Didn’t you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tommy’s gonna be made.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie’s gonna make him?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little
guinea fuck. Someday he’s gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we’ll
work for him.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jimmy, can I talk to you now?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey! Come on, already. If it wasn’t for me,
none of you would have had anything.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Will you shut your fucking mouth. You’re
gonna get your money, just stop busting balls. Okay? Relax. You hear?
Everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Son of a bitch. You’re a pisser.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You wanna talk? Okay, come on, let’s get it
over with. I swear I’ve never known a ball buster like you in all my
life.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ah, but Jimmy, nobody loves you. like I do.
You know that. You name it. I’ll do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Except to stop busting my balls.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Open up. Henry! Karen! It’s me. Fran!</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Marty didn’t come home. He’s missing. I know
something happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Wait a minute. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Fran. It’ll be okay. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I know something happened.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What could happen? He got drunk. He passed
out somewhere. I’ll go looking for him in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: In twenty years he’s never been away all night
without calling. I know something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Awright, awright. Let me take you home and
I’ll go look for him myself. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’ll I tell Fran?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a
broad. What do you care about her.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, don’t fuck around, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do it all the time. Bust their fucking
balls.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy, come on. Fuck ’em. Don’t give them the
satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on, fuckoes. Let’s go for a ride. I keep
‘em up all fuckin’ night.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cafora’s pink cadillac parked on brooklyn street
near</strong>: SCHOOL BUS STOP - MORNING</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy was cutting every link between himself
and the robbery, but it had nothing to do with me. I gave Jimmy the tip
and he gave me some Christmas money. From then on I kept my mouth shut.
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his. I know he kicked some money
upstairs to Paulie, but that was it. It made him sick to have to turn
money over to the guys who stole it. He’d rather whack them. Anyway,
what did I care? I wasn’t. asking for anything and, besides. Jimmy was
making nice money with me through my Pittsburgh connections. But still,
for months after the robbery, they were finding bodies all over.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: When they found Sepe in the meat truck, he
was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy. He was
like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people and
after a while even the Lufthansa thing began to calm down. But the thing
that made Jimmy so happy that morning was that this was the day Tommy
was being made.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy was so excited, you’d think he was
being made. He must have made four calls to Tommy’s house. They had a
signal all set up so he’d know the minute the ceremony. was over.-</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You want the melon?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I better call again.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy and I could never be made, because we
bad Irish blood. It didn’t even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To
become a member of a crew, you’ve got to be one hundred percent Italian
So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.</p>
<p><strong>int. one-family brioc building with garage under the
first</strong>: FLOOR</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s the highest honor they can give you. It
means you belong to a family and a crew. It means that nobody can fuck
around with you. It also means you can fuck around with anybody, as long
as they aren’t also a member. It’s like a license to steal.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy
being made, it was like we were all being made. We would now have one of
our own guys as a member.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Except, they didn’t make Tommy that day.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They killed him. It was revenge for Billy
Batts.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And there was nothing we could do. Batts was
a made man and Tommy wasn’t. We had to sit still and take it. It was
among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit. They even shot Tommy in
the face so his mother couldn’t give him an open coffin at the
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was going to be busy all day. I had to drop
off some thirty-eights at Jimmy’s to match some silencers he had gotten.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him back to the
house for dinner and then I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for
Judy to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What fucking good are these things? They
don’t fit. What do I need this for? I’m not paying for this shit.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Right away I knew he didn’t want them. I knew
I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns
because he wanted them. And now, he didn’t want them. I didn’t say a
thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn’t even say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns,
and since I was going to see them later in the afternoon to pick up a
delivery, I was pretty sure I’d get my money back.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: When I finally got there to pick up Michael,
his doctor wanted to put me in bed. I told him about the accident. I
said I was partying all night.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He took mercy on me. He gave me ten
milligrams of Valium and sent me home. My plan was to drop off my
brother at the house and pick up Karen.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I think that helicopter’s following me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was cooking dinner that night. I had to
start braising the beef, pork butt and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It’s Michael’s favorite. I was making ziti with the meat gravy, and I’m
planning to roast some peppers over the flames, and I was putting on
some string beans with the olive oil and garlic, and I had some
beautiful cutlets, cut just right, that I was going to fry up before
dinner just as an appetizer. I was home for about an hour. My plan was
toStart the dinner early, so Karen and I could go unload the guns that
Jimmy didn’t want, and get the package for Judy to take to Atlanta latex
that night. I kept looking out the window and the helicopter was gone. I
asked Michael to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We’re going to your mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Now I’m sure we’re being tailed. My plan was
to go to her mother’s and unload the guns. Who needed them in the trunk
with all this heat?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go inside. Tell her not to touch anything
outside the house. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Let’s go shopping.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m not nuts. It’s been following me all
fucking morning. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They think I’m paranoid. The dumb fucks. I
should bring them the helicopter, then we’ll see how paranoid I am.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Okay! Quick! Let’s get back to your
mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Didn’t I tell you you were paranoid? See,
Karen, didn’t I tall him he was paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I need some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: My plan was I had to get home and get the
package ready for Judy to take on her trip. Also, I had to get to
Robin’s house to give the package a whack with some quinine. Plus, I
knew Robin was gonna get on my ass. Then I had the cooking to finish at
home, and I had to get Judy ready for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: It’s Robin.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A pain in the ass. I’ll see you in about an
hour. I can’t. I got my brother home tonight. We’ll talk about it later.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Henry says don’t let the sauce stick.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m stirring.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You know what to do?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Now this is important. Make sure you leave
the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It’s
important. Call from an outside phone. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jesus! You must think I’m dumb. What are you
bugging me for? I know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Just make sure you do it. You know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>jddy</strong>: Jesus Christ! You can be such a pain.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Just do what I say! Judy Okay.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So, what does she do after she hangs up with
me? After everything I had told her? After all her yeah, yeah, yeah,
bullshit? She picks up the phone and calls from the house. Now, if
anybody was listening, they’d know everything. They’d know that a
package was leaving from my house and they’d even have the time and the
flight number. Thanks to her.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As soon as I got home, I started cooking. I
had a few hours until Judy’s flight. I told my brother to keep an eye on
the stove. All day long, the poor guy’s been watching helicopters and
tomato sauce. I had to drive over to Robin’s place, mix it once and get
back to the gravy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I don’t need this… You said tonight and now
it’s not tonight…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll make it up. I promise. Just
hurry it up a little. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You bastard! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I gotta go home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket
I’ve been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your
leg.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I gotta go home and get my hat.</p>
<p><strong>enry</strong>: Forget your fucking hat. What are you, kidding
me? Just what I need now is a trip to Rockaway. Just because you want
your hat.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I need it. I gotta have it. It’s my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do you realize what we’re involved in here
now?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t care. I need my hat. I won’t go
without it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What could I do? If she insisted, I had to
drive her home for her goddamn hat. I threw the package in the kitchen
and went to take her hone.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: One move, motherfucker, and I’ll blow you
away.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For a second I thought I was dead, but when I
heard all the noise, I knew they were cops, only cops talk that way. If
they had been wiseguys, I wouldn’t have heard a thing. I would have been
dead.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: All day I thought the guys in the helicopter
were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa, but they turned
out to be Narks. They had been on me a month. Phone taps.
Surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jimmy’s calling every day. It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What did he say, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I
talk to Mickey every day. That’s more than I can say for the rest.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paul will calm down. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze
our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know
what’s happening. You gotta meet him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn’t I tell you I
gotta get out of here first. I gotta straighten every- thing out with
Paulie or I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Then you’re safer in here.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Safe? Here? They’ll kill me here. They’re all
afraid I’m gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away
from me. I’m dead in here. You gotta get me out.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Who’s gonna do that?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Just get me out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Karen finally got her mother to put her house
up for my bail. I was out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I remember I had this feeling I was going to
get killed right outside the jail. I knew Paulie was still pissed at me
and he’s such a hothead I was afraid he might have me whacked before he
calmed down. And I was also worried about Jimmy. Jimmy knew if Paulie
found out he was in the drug deals with me, Paulie would have Jimmy
killed even before me. This is the bad time. I didn’t feel safe until I
got home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So now my plan was to stay alive long enough
to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while
until I got things straightened out.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Where’s the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You know. The stuff I left.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I flushed it down the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What did you want me to do with it? They were
all over the house.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty
thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They had a warrant. They went through
everything. They would have found it. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shit You know they would have never found it.
Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do
it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh no! No! Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>hehry</strong>: Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: I warned you a million times.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ve been all fucked up since I got out.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You think I didn’t know what you were
doing?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit!
I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Right in my face. You looked in my face and
you lied.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: But, Paulie, I’m sorry. Believe me. I was
fucking crazy. But I’m okay now. I can be trusted. I’m clean now. On my
children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head
together…</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You thought I was some fucking jerk?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie, I couldn’t come to you. I didn’t want
to put you in this shit. I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Paulie. You’re all I got. I need help.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: You treated me like shit.</p>
<p><strong>vario</strong>: Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on
you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thirty-two hundred bucks. That’s what he gave
me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn’t have paid for
the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m not going to run. Live the rest of our
lives like rats. Is that what, you want? Leave my mother. Leave my
family. Never see anybody again.</p>
<p><strong>hood</strong>: We’re gonna leave then anyway, because if we
stay around here we’re gonna be dead.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They’re right. You are paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How is he? Okay? Are they busting his
chops?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s okay. They sobered him up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did he say what they’re asking him about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jimmy. I don’t know. I got so much else on my
mind. I got the kids. We got no money.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He says he’s too hot. He doesn’t even know I
came here today. It’s like he’s crazy. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know. I know. But it’ll be okay. Don’t
worry. I got some money for you. It’s down the block.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The third store down.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It
felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores
were empty.</p>
<p><strong>karen)</strong>: I got a bad feeling. I just kept
walking.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Inside! Go in there!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jimmy, I’m in a hurry. I’ve got to pick up
the kids at my mother’s. I’ll come back later.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What happened? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I got seared.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Okay. Don’t worry about it. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I got scared.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: If you’re part of a crew, nobody ever tells
you that they’re going to kill you. It doesn’t happen that way. There
aren’t any arguments or curses like in the movies. Your murderers come
with smiles. They come as your friends, the people who have cared for
you all your life, and they always come at a time when you are at your
weakest and most in need of their help. So I met Jimmy in a crowded
place we both knew. I got there fifteen minutes early and I saw that
Jimmy was already there. He took the booth near the window so he could
see everyone who drove up to the restaurant. He wanted to see if I had
been tailed.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You look good.</p>
<p><strong>henkf</strong>: I didn’t need the headache.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on, eat something.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I can’t eat, just get me some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He was jumpy. He hadn’t touched a thing. In
the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the
surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed
to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling
Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my
neck.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think you got a good shot at beating the
case.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He
ratted you all out. He’s been a rat since he got busted in
Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s hiding, thE son of a bitch, in
Florida.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I want you and Anthony to go down there and
take care of that bastard. Without him, they’ve got no case.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody
before, but now he’s asking me to go down to Florida and do a hit with
Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s when I knew I would never have come
back from Florida alive.</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: We’ll pack up everything and send it to
you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I got dry cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: We’ll pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: We’ll sell your house here and apply the
money to your new name.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I don’t want to go anywhere it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: I can’t control that.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I don’t care who controls it. Nowhere
cold.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s very bronchial.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What about the schools?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah. What about the kids’ school?</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: Don’t worry about the schools. We’ll take
care of the schools.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t want them left back.</p>
<p><strong>mcdonald</strong>: They won’t be left back. They’ll stay in
their grade.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s important.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was easy for all of us to disappear. My
house was in my mother- in-law’s name. My cars were registered to my
wife. My Social Security cards and driver’s licenses were phonies. I’ve
never , voted. I never paid taxes. My birth certificate and my arrest
sheet, that’s all you’d ever have to know I was alive.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The hardest thing for me was leaving the
life. I still love the life. We were treated like movie stars with
muscle. We had it all just for the asking.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Our wives, mothars, kids, everybody rode
along. I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen and a
sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Anything I wanted was a phone call away. Free
cars and the keys to a dozen hideouts flats all over the city. I’d bet
twenty, thirty grand over a weekend …</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: … and than I’d either blow the winnings in a
week or go to the sharks to pay back the bookies.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It didn’t matter. When I was broke I just
went out and robbed some more. We ran everything. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off cops. Everybody had their hands out. And now it’s all
over.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And that’s the hardest part. Today everything
is different. There’s no action.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I have to wait around like anyone else. Yon
can’t even get decent food. Right after I got hare I ordered some
spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m an average nobody. I get to live the rest
of my life like a schnook.</p>
