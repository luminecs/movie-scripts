<p><strong>maroon cartoons present</strong>: BABY HERMAN AND ROGER
RABBIT IN “THE BUNNYSITTER”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mommy’s going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I’m leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger. He’s going to take
very, very good care of you… … cause if he doesn’t, he’s going back to
the science lab!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Baby bye-bye…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, come back! You heard what your
mother said!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Coo-kie.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hang on, Baby. I’ll save you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cut, cut, cut!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: What the hell was wrong with
<u>that</u> take??</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Nothin’ with you, Baby Herman. It’s on
Roger… <u>again</u>! Hey! Could we lose the playback?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: What’s this, Roger?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A tweeting bird?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: That’s right, a tweeting bird. But what
does the script say? ‘Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!’ Not
birds, stars!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Aw, for cryin’ out loud, Roger! I’ll be
in my trailer… takin’ a nap!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I
know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’ve already dropped it on you
twenty-three times.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry about me. I can take
it.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m not worried about you. I’m worried
about the safe.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Starting tomorrow there’ll be no more roast
beef lunches. What happened to cheese sandwiches? I was raised on cheese
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: And tell that guy sleepin’ over there he’s
fired!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: It’s your wife’s brother, R.K.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Oh… tell him he’s promoted. But get him out
of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant, did you see the rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He was blowin’ his lines, all right. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: So what? He’s already put me three weeks
behind on the shooting schedule!</p>
<p><strong>costumer</strong>: Your reaction, R.K.?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No! That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: <u>That’s</u> funny. Put a homburg on him
it’ll even be funnier. Huh, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, that’d be a riot.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Boy, I hope what you have ain’t contagious
or I’ll be out of business.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: How much do you know about show business,
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Only there’s no business like it, no
business I know.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Yeah, and there’s no business as expensive.
I’m twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and
it’s all because that rabbit can’t keep his mind on his work. And you
know why?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: One too many safes dropped on his head?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Nah, that goes with the territory. He’s a
stunt bunny.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Here’s the problem… “Seen cooing over
calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit… wife of Maroon
star, Roger”. His wife’s a tramp, but he thinks she’s Betty Crocker. The
doubt’s eatin’ him up.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin’ I
can wise the rabbit up with.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t work in Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You don’t have to. The rabbit’s wife sings
at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink &amp; Paint Club. You
can catch her in action there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The job’s gonna cost you a hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: A hundred bucks? That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So’s the job.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: All right, all right… You got your hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Kinda jumpy aren’t you, Valiant? It’s just
Dumbo.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I got him on loan from Disney.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Aren’t you the lucky one…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: When will I hear from you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: As soon as is humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Damn Toons.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: What do I look like, a bank?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: So long, mister.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks for the cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, fellas, what’s the good word?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Lost my job.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Mule died.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, you know what they say about dames,
Augie…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So, makin’ dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well,
lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out
of the till so your landlord would’t throw you out of your dump. And it
was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town
would. And it’s a <u>dame</u> who’s tired of waitin’ for you to
straighten yourself out and get a job!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Would this be the same dame who’s going to
feel awfully foolish when she finds out I’ve got her money.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five
before they check the books tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’ll have it in the morning. Now be a
sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Is this paper even good?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Check the scrawl.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: R.K. Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Maroon? Valiant, don’t tell me you’re
workin’ for a Toon? Who’s your client? Chilly Willy or Screwy
Squirrel?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get this straight, greaseball. I’m not
workin’ for a Toon! I’d never work for a <u>Toon</u>! Got that?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: What’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Toon killed his brother.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Walt sent me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Like your monkey suit.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Wise ass…</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Will you listen to that? It’s a pip! I’m
thinking of callin’ it a Whoopee Cushion.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: No hard feelings, I hope. Put ’er there…</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Hand buzzer… real gasser.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: There’s a two drink minimum.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just as long as there’s no maximum.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Waiter, I’ll sign my check now.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s it for you, pops!</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Calm down, son. Look, the ink is gone.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: See? It disappears.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, why don’t you make like the ink?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette girl</strong>: Cigars… cigarettes… Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Gee, it’s swell to see you, Eddie. We
miss you in Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Wish I could say the same. What’re you
doin’ here, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Work’s been slow for me since the
cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie… ‘Boop boop
be-doop’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who’s
Mr. Jocularity?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: That’s Marvin Acme, the gag king.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Shoulda guessed.</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: He comes here every night to see Jessica
Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Big on the musical comedy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Sounds like you ve never seen her,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>droopy</strong>: Hello, everybody. I hope you’re all having
as much fun as I am. I have a small announcement to make. Jessica Rabbit
will not be able to sing tonight.</p>
<p><strong>droopy</strong>: I was merely jesting. Without further ado…
here’s woman times two, Toontown’s own chanteuse par excellance… Jessica
Rabbit!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘You had plenty of money back in ’22
You let other woman make a fool of you Why don’t you do right. Like some
other men do… Get out of here and Get me the money too…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘Why don’t you do right. Like some
other men do…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘You ain’t got no money Ain’t got no
use for you…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘So get out of here… And get me the
money toooo!’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Thanks for your lap.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Hey, whaddaya think you’re doin’,
chump?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Who’re you callin’ chump, chimp?</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Oh, it’s da comedian…</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: And don’t lemme catch your peepin’ face
around here again. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Ooga-booga.</p>
<p><strong>acme</strong>: Are we going to play pattycake tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Marvin, I have a headache…</p>
<p><strong>acme</strong>: But you promised…</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, all right. But this time take
that hand buzzer off…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Pattycake! Pattycake!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Baker’s man… but no use ruinin’ a good pair
of shoes over it.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Take comfort, son, you’re not the first man
whose wife played pattycake on him.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I don’t believe it. I won’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: The pictures don’t lie. Mr. Valiant here
took them himself.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But Jessy… she’s the light of my life,
the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, you better start thinkin’ about
drinkin’ it black.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Frankly, I’m shocked. Marvin Acme’s been my
friend and neighbor for thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Who would have thought he was the Sugar
Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Well, the important thing now Roger, is to
put all this behind you. Drink this, son, you’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I know this all seems painful now, but
you’ll find someone new. Won’t he, Mr, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah. Good lookin’ guy like him.
Dames’ll be breakin’ his door down.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch… Mr. Maroon, I think I’ll be
goin’ now, so about the rest of my fee…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Sure, Valiant, sure…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Being experienced in these matrimonial
matters, you have any advice for our friend here?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get
yourself a quickie divorce.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Divorce? Never!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Marriage is a two-way street and we’re
just experiencing a detour! Jessica and I are going to get back
together. We’re going to be <u>happy</u>! H-A-P-P-I!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: At least he took it well.</p>
<p><strong>int. valiant’s bungalow - close - empty booze bottle -
early</strong>: MORNING</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lieutenant Santino… how ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Tell me you didn’t do a snoop job for a
Toon named Roger the Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s what you woke me up for?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: You got trouble, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just haven’t been this close to Toontown
for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Let’s go, somebody wants to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: They say the rabbit got the safe idea
from a cartoon he was makin’ the other day.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What a gasser.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Wait here…</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: Say, didn’t you used to be Eddie
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Mr. Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I hope you’re proud of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: She likes you, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #2</strong>: When they drew her, they broke the
pencil.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Makes you wonder what in the world she was
doin’ with a guy who didn’t clean his fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: So… it’s blood.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: It’s not blood, it’s paint.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Is this man removing evidence from the scene
of a crime?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Uh… no, Judge Doom. Valiant here was
just about to hand it over, weren’t you, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Looks like the deceased grabbed a handful of
your client’s pantaloons, Mr. Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s not my client. I was workin’ for R.K.
Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the
rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said
nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that
true?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, pal, do I look like a
stenographer?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Watch your mouth, Eddie, he’s a
judge.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: The rabbit’s movements are fairly clear after
leaving the Maroon Studios. He ran across the street, jimmied this door
open, hoisted the safe on a block and tackle…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: … then stood out here waiting for his prey.
After he cold-bloodedly accomplished his task, he went home. He was
almost apprehended there by my men.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Men? They look more like weasles to me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift
for the work. The rabbit didn’t contact you by any chance, did he?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why would he contact me? I just took some
lousy pictures.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: So you wouldn’t have any idea where he might
be?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo’s very
nice this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’m surprised you aren’t more cooperative,
Mr. Valiant. A human has been murdered by a Toon. Don’t you appreciate
the magnitude of that? My goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to rein in
the insanity. To bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no
civilized person has ever been able to step foot. The only way to do
that is to make the Toons respect the law.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Judge Doom! Here, let me get that for
ya.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Why, you filthy little vagrant, you’ve soiled
my robe!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: It’s cleanin’ up real good. Judge.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You’ve defiled a symbol of justice.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Where’d this gargoyle come from anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: No one knows. He bought the election a
few years back. He’s been rulin’ Toontown ever since.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme go. I
think I hear my mother callin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Voltaire… the Gopher!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Hey, don’t I have any rights?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, you do… to a swift and speedy trial.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Court is now in session.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
assault and resisting arrest. How do you find him?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Guilty as charged. Case closed!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I hereby sentence you to the dip!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Oh no, not the dip! Anything but the dip!
I’m too young to die…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s with the dip?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: That’s how he gets rid of the
troublemakers. It’s a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint
remover. He calls it the… Final Solution.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Help! Help! He…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They’re not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant. but
that’s how we handle things in Toontown. I would think you’d appreciate
that.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: After all, didn’t a Toon kill your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped
in it this time.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What are you complaining about? Here’s your
fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: Thirty-five years and all I got to show
for it is a ticket punch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s with Earl?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big
company called Cloverleaf Industries.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No kiddin’? Bought the Red Cars, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Bastards put him on notice.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Here’s to the pencil pushers. May they all
get lead poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: The old Number Six Line… who’da thought
they’d close that one down?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, get him down from there. He’s gonna
break his neck.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: Took you right to Toontown, it did.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I know, I know… poor S.O.B.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Do you think the rabbit did it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t wanna think. I wanna drink.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Make that a round.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: We don’t serve formula. Snookums.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: You serve martinis, doncha?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Make it dry. Baby doesn’t like to be
wet. You’re Valiant, right? The name’s Baby Herman.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I know who you are. Kinda out of your
neighborhood, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Yeah, I had to go slummin’. See, a
friend of mine’s bein’ framed.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: You don’t believe that. I mean. the
guy’s an idiot, a moron, a complete fool… but he’d never kill anyone. I
know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Thanks, doll.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh, a ladies man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
lust and a three-year-old dinkie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My problem is I come here to drink in
peace. So if you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: C’mon, Valiant, doesn’t this whole
thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a
mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah, Eddie, it’s not like you got an ad in
the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks for the vote of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: And another thing, the paper said no
will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he
promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So where is it then?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Somebody took it from him. That’s what
this whole thing’s about.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The papers said the safe door was opened,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Stick to stuffin’ the olives, willya,
Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: My hunch is it was Maroon. He always
was after Acme’s property.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: No. But neither does Roger. That’s
Diablo Red. Roger’s pants are Sunrise Orange.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well, I’ll be…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: So what’s your next move, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My next move? That’s easy. I’m gettin’ up,
and I’m walkin’ out the door, and I’m goin’ home to bed.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So you’re not even gonna bother to find out
if the rabbit’s gettin’ framed?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s a Toon… who cares?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well, you used to care, Eddie. And it didn
t matter if a client’s skin was black, white, or painted!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I needed a place to hide. I’m in
trouble, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So I hear. Even talkin’ to you could get me
a rap for aiding and abetting.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry, Eddie, no one knows I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah? Then how’d you find my house?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, I asked the newsboy on the
corner. He didn’t know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally
the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: In other words, the whole goddamn world
knows you’re here! Out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Please, Eddie, don’t put me out. I
didn’t do it, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
not that way.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: After I left you, I went to see her at
the Ink &amp; Paint Club.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: She was on stage, so I found a piece
of paper and wrote her a love letter.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ’Dear Jessy. How do I love thee? Let
me count the ways. 1-1000, 2-1000, 3-1000…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, that wasn’t very nice.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It took me almost an hour to compose
that. But I decided not to leave it anyway. I’d read it in person, that
was my plan.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Look, pal, if you’re still here when I
finish this drink, I’m callin’ the police.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t do that! I’m innocent I tell ya.
The police’ll just dip me. They were waitin’ for me when I got home last
night. I ran.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If you’re so innocent, why’d you run?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, Eddie, I’m a rabbit. We always
run.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, this is the moment of truth! And
I’ve spoken the truth, but you won’t believe the truth. So I guess the
truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is slung. my fait is accompli.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Won’t anything change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The goddamn will.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: L.A.P.D.?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You mean you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It’s Toon Control!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get away from that window.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You’re gonna help me? How can I ever
thank you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: For starters… don’t ever kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Police…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’ll talk to ’em. Find a place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not in there. That’s the first place
they’ll look.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Eddie Valiant… you’re under arrest!
Just kidding…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You idiot. I lost the key for those
cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: We got him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey! What do you think you’re doin’?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you’re not a
Toon.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Don’t ever forget that.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Scent’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Pssst.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Funny… I could swear I smelled
rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: News flash… Hollywood. Citywide Toonhunt
for Roger Rabbit, suspect in Acme slaying. Police describe him as short,
cuddly… and psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Mother Mary…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hurry, hurry…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
is?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Charmed, enchanted, pleasure’s all
mined.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Where’d you find him?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The Toon Fairy left him under my
pillow.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He’s a riot.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not handcuffed to
him. Anybody in the back room?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So you decided to help him after all?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I oughta have my head examined. Will you
hold still?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Does this help?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You mean to tell me you coulda taken your
hand outta that cuff at any time?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, no, not <u>any</u> time. Only
when it was funny.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Are you always this funny, or only on days
when you’re wanted for murder?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: My philosophy is if you don’t have a
sense of humor, you’re better off dead.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah… well you just might get your
wish.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Can you get him out of it, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme
bad enough to get this.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Acme’s will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: So that’s what this little drama is
all about.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the
sound mind, your wife the sound body.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I resent that innuendo! My wife is
completely innocent.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but
innocent isn’t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So what’s the scam, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants
Acme’s property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: The habeus corpus is thickening.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don’t think
they got the will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that
night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the
body.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Maybe they just took it out of his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Then why’d they bother to crack the safe?
You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won’t open.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in
the safe before they killed him?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Because he’s not forty feet tall. The safe
was up on the ceiling, remember?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow
maybe I’ll go down to probate court and see who’s sniffin’ around Acme’s
estate?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, do that. I’m gonna go rattle Maroon’s
cage.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: What should I do? Who should I see?
Where should I go?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Nothin’, no one, nowhere,</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown, but
not at the Maroon Studio.</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
aside, Roger Rabbit may have been willing to play second banana to an
ankle-biter, but I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: This’ll be fine, huh, Augie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Forget about the prices, pal. If you want
the shrimp cocktail, you have a shrimp cocktail. Excuse me, Augie, I’ve
got a little table-hopping to do.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I think you should know, R.K., we’re in
negotiations for Bugs to star in his own series at Warner Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Trying to scare up a bidding war between me
and Jack Warner, eh? Well, it won’t work. I’ll call William Morris and
I’ll have ’em put out a rabbit call the likes of which this town’s never
seen!</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: It’s your dime, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: And stop callin’ me Doc!</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: Eh, sure, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant? What’re you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I Just thought I’d drop by and show you a
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I’ve already seen your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you
might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Anyway… enjoy your lunch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How is that, Augie, pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: It’s me. Valiant says there’s a will. I
don’t know what he’s trying to pull…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Somebody’s gonna have to take care of
him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The old man had it at the club that night.
That’s right. Yeah, I’m sure. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Iris… cancel my appointments this
afternoon. I’ll be at Forest Lawn.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You did great, Augie. Have another shrimp
cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Love that Red Car.</p>
<p><strong>foghorn leghorn</strong>: Today we commit the body of brother
Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold ground. We shed no tears for we know
that Marvin is going to a better place. That high, high, I say that
high-larious place up in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: A-men!</p>
<p><strong>foghorn leghorn</strong>: Give us a sign, brother Herman,
that you’ve arrived…</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: Round and round the mullberry bush, The
monkey chased the weasle…</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: The monkey raid it all was in fun. POP! Goes
the weasle.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: So… trying to pull a fast one on me,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Somethin’ you want, mister?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not anymore…</p>
<p><strong>mover #1</strong>: I don’t know about you, but it makes me
sick to think of these beautiful pianos gettin’ chopped into match
sticks every night by those screwy ducks.</p>
<p><strong>mover #2</strong>: And they call it entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>donald duck</strong>: Phooey! Out of tune again!</p>
<p><strong>daffy duck</strong>: Not to worry, Donald. We can fix that
with my sledgehammer.</p>
<p><strong>donald duck</strong>: Never mind, Daffy. I’ve got an axe in
my dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Girl’s gotta protect herself.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: And here I tought we had mice.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: … I caught him rummagin’ around in here.
Then I called you, Judge, on a counta you be da one we pay juice to.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You did the right thing, Bongo.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Being caught breaking and entering is not very
good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for,
Mr. Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Ask her…</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Last week some heavy breather wanted
one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that’s what he was after?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda
broken into Frederick’s of Hollywood. I was lookin’ for Marvin Acme’s
will.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the
probate is in my court.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He had a will, all right. She took it off
Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her
loving husband to take the fall.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk
or punch drunk. Probably both.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: These are bold accusations, Mr. Valiant. I
hope you have some proof?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I found the cover the will came in behind
the dressing table.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: They must’ve taken it off me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The other people who were in here lookin’
for the will. I woulda caught ’em if Cheetah here hadn’t interrupted
me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Take it easy, Bongo. We’ll handle Mr. Valiant
our own way… downtown.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I’d
be more than glad to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.
<u>Toon</u>town.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re not takin’ me to downtown
<u>Toon</u>town?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Indeed we are. We’ll continue the
interrogation there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I ain’t tellin’ you nothin’! Get me
Santino.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You’re a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant. Very
pig-headed. Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the
Toontown station…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No… you bastards! Leggo of me!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: What’re you shakin’ for? Didn’t you have
a good time last time you were here?</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Soo-eey! Soo-eey!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Let him go, boys. I think he’s got the
message.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Here’s one for the books… a Toon wearin’ human
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Earl… it’s me, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Eddie? Jesus, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Toon cops worked me over.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Boy, I’ll say. They gave you a real
Toon-a-Roo.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What am I, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re a pig… a happy-go-lucky pig.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not much. It’s hard to talk.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the
back so you won’t cause as much of a commotion.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Can I, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: Go ahead, darling. Take your bat.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hi, Mr. Pig. If I hit you on the head, will you
make me a cuckoo bird?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Kid, if you hit me on the head, I’m gonna
throw you out this window.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the
doorbell, but I guess you couldn’t hear it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s because I don’t have a doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh… well, I… I just had to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Okay, you’ve seen me. Now give me a
towel.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: What’s <u>that</u> thing?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Come on, lady, haven’t you ever seen a mole
before?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Toons aren’t given
imperfections.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No? I guess we’re not counting lying,
stealing and murder.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You’ve got the wrong idea about me.
I’a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I’ll
pay you anything.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, I’ll bet you would. You gotta have
the rabbit to make the scam work.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: No, no, no… I love my husband.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin’
outside your little hutch, holdin’ a carrot cake waitin’ for hubby to
come home.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, please don’t make fun of me, Mr,
Valiant. You don’t know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I
do.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, well, you don’t know how hard it is
bein’ a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I’m not bad, I’m just drawn that
way.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m not complainin’. But give me credit.
I’m the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin’ pattycake,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Maroon came to me. He told me he’d
fire Roger if I didn’t do it. I went along with him for Roger’s sake. It
was only pattycake, after all.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So altruistic.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: It’s the truth. Why won’t you
believe it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Cause I don’t take Acme Dumb Pills. I don’t
know what you’re up to, lady, but I’m gonna nail you for the Acme
murder.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: If I’m as bad as you think, what’s
stopping me from just killing you right now?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: This cup of turpentine right here. Go for
that gun in your purse and I’m gonna let you have it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, Mr, Valiant, please… you’re my
only hope.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I’m weak… you’re strong. Can’t you
find a place somewhere in your heart to help me?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Dabblin’ in watercolors, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Lemme guess… your cousin from Des
Moines?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Perhaps I should go.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Must you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Goodbye, Eddie… don’t hate me.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What was <u>that</u>?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The rabbit’s wife? Wanna tell me what she
was doin’ with her arms around you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Probably lookin’ for a good place to stick
a knife.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I just stopped by to tell you that I
checked out the Acme probate.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maroon, right?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Nope. It’s that Cloverleaf outfit
again.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell would they want with a gag
factory?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Got me. But unless the will shows up by
Friday midnight, it’s theirs.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s that comin’ from the bar?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Sounds like singin’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>roger rab3it</strong>: ‘The merry-go-round broke down But you
don’t see me frown…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘Things turned out fine And now she’s
mine…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘… Cause the merry-go-round Went
round… Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘My name is Roger Rabbit I’ve got a
crazy habit I like to sing and dance and yuk…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘… So brighten up and smile You
schmuck’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, don’t I get an encore?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why, you crazy Toon… I’ve been out there
riskin’ my neck for you. I come back here and you’re singin’ and
dancin’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But that’s my calling, my purpose, my
raison d’etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh… and believe me,
those people needed a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: And when they’re done laughin’ , they’re
gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Angelo? He’s a pal, a chum…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got
outta prison.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well… I still don’t think he’d turn me
in.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just because you got ’em to laugh?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A laugh can be a powerful thing,
Eddie. Sometimes it’s the only weapon we have in life.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
variety.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’ve met some cynical and miserable
humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, right now it’s gonna be your
funereal.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Go ahead and throw that punch. But
you’d be more successful with a punch <u>line</u>.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re driving me crazy, you know that?
Let’s go… you ruined this as a hiding place.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’m looking for a rabbit. He was last seen in
this neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You couldn’t miss him. Buck teeth. Orange
pants. About yea big.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: There’s no rabbit here, so don’t harass my
customers.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I didn’t come here to harass. I came here to
reward.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Hey, I seen a rabbit…</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: He’s right here in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Say ’ello, <u>Harvey</u>.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: My pal.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Now we’ll see who laughs best…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Valiant? Why is it that whenever my men smell
a rabbit, you’re there?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Must be my cologne… Eau Dc Carrot.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: He’s in here all right, boss.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Youse want we should take the place
apart?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No, Sergeant. That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I know a trick that no Toon can resist.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You know, Doom, I don’t know who’s Toonier,
you or the rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Shave… and… a haircut…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Two… bits! Uh… oh…</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Oyez… oyez… oyez… court is now in
session.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold blooded
murder of a human… Marvin Acme. The jury will direct their attention to
exhibits A, B, and C.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Motive, evidence, modus operandi. How do you
find the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Guilty as charged. Case closed!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: For this heinous crime, I sentence you to the
dip!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: No, no. not the dip! Eddie, tell him I
didn’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t think it’s gonna matter. Sorry,
pal, I tried.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, and for that you’re charged with aiding
and abetting. But we’ll let Santino handle that.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, doesn’t the rabbit even get a last
request?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think you want a drink. How about it,
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Well, why not? I’m feeling magnanimous
tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my
career as a jurist. I’m retiring to take a new role in the private
sector.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah? Well, don’t expect the Toons to give
you a gold watch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Here you go, kid… say hi to Casper for
me.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But, Eddie, you know what happens
when…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Drink it, jerk. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: After them you fools…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin’.
Nothin’ like usin’ the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I’m so smart, how come I’m runnin’ from
the law with a Toon?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: If you effect my extrication, I could
offer you some carburetion.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Well… what’re we waitin’ for, the William
Tell Overture?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Uh… except hang onto your hat.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: That’s what I was afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Read all about it, Benny’s back in
town!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Going up…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
escaped convicts. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, Benny, what were you in for?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Reckless driving. Do you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hard to imagine.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Hold your breath, babies…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but is
the sky falling or what?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Grab it, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The brakes! The brakes!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Forget the brakes, who brought the water
wings?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Maybe it’s my imagination, but I always
seem to run better after I’ve had a wash. Now where can I drop you
cats?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks, Benny.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: If you ever need me, just stick out your
thumb.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Valiant and Valiant? Who’s the other
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My brother. Get inside.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: So what’s our plan, our scenario, our
modus operandi?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: We can’t do anything till it’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Guess you haven’t been here in a
while. ‘Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Say, who’s this guy laughin’?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, I didn’t recognize you… I’ve
never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin’ the rabbit
ears?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What is this, Twenty Questions?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m gonna get some sleep. I suggest you do
the same.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you
for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, you shamuses are a tough
audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid,
embittering?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You wanna know? Well, since you’re so
goddamn curious, I’ll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A Toon? Noooo.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed
Bambi’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous,
despicable… a smear on the drafting board.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and
Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn’t see the bad in
‘em. And when this guy was accused of knockin’ over the First National
Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found
out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he
was wise. He got the drop on us… literally.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Safe?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into
Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get away from there.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Wrong number?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I was hopin’ you’d be there. Maroon’s
called here about four times. He says he’s gotta talk to you tonight. He
says he can help you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Are you gonna call him, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’ve I got to lose? You okay,
Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah… they closed me down for a coupla
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’ll work out just fine. When this thing
is over, I’ll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maroon? Whaddaya want?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Have you got the will?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maybe. Why?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Meet me at my studio at nine o’clock. If
you’ve got the will maybe we can stop this thing.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, Eddie, you’re not gonna go, are
ya? Maroon’ll be layin’ for ya at nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s why I’ll be there at 8:45.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I tell you what, maybe I better come
with you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You know, Eddie, I’m not as much of a
chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How much is a shave and a haircut,
Roger?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Two bits.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I rest my case.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I don’t make it back here by ten…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: … I’d head for Cucamonga.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Cucamonga? I don’t know anybody in
Cucamonga.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Steady, R.K., that stuff’s eighteen years
old.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant! You surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That was the idea.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re not too good at this, are you,
R.K.?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No… I’m not. I’m a cartoon maker, not a
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, everybody needs a hobby.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had
nothin’ to do with Acme gettin’ killed. I just wanted to sell my studio.
But they wouldn’t buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he
wouldn’t. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the
rabbit’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: But then it all went to hell. I been around
Toons all my life. I can’t sit around and see them all destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You got the will in there, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You tricked me, damn you!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: There’s no time to take it easy! You don’t
realize the diabolical mind we’re dealing with!</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: If I don’t get that will by midnight
tonight, Toontown’s just gonna be land for the free…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: And the home of the brave?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #2</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ’46.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #3</strong>: Who won the war?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #4</strong>: Who do you think, dummy?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #5</strong>: Welcome back, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #6</strong>: Where you been the last five years?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Drunk.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Feelin’ frisky tonight, boys?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dums</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … From the tippy tip top of
Toontown’s Tip Top Club, this is Mellow Melody Matinee. Here’s our
favorite cricket, Jimmy, with ‘Give A Little Whistle’.</p>
<p><strong>jiminy cricket</strong>: ‘When you get in trouble, and you
don’t know right from wrong…’</p>
<p><strong>jiminy cricket</strong>: ‘… Give a little whistle Give a
little whistle…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I hate Toontown…</p>
<p><strong>wolf</strong>: Helloooo, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t shoot, Eddie. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell are you doin’ in there?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
When I heard those shots, I thought I’d help you and investigate the
inside of this trunk.</p>
<p><strong>roger ra13bit</strong>: Hey, what’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m making sure you don’t help me
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I guess they didn’t clean up after the last
moider.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Don’t move, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well… I always figured I’d get it in
Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I think I got him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You shot Roger.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: That’s not Roger. It’s one of Doom’s
men. He killed R.K. Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry, you’re not the first.
We better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hmmm… What would be the harm if I took
her for a spin?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Ah… the open road.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: It was Doom who killed Acme, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I didn’t know who I could trust.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: We’re even. By the way, I did find your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s right here in the…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: … car.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hi, Roger Rabbit. Love your work.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How did you get onto Doom?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Marvin told me. Doom was after his
land. Ne was afraid. That’s why he brought me his will.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: When I opened up the blue envelope,
all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: A joker to the end.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Looks like our goose is cooked, our
hash is slung, our fait is accompli…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell
me somethin’, what’d you ever see in that guy anyway?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: He made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, do you prefer to die this way or that
way?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Benny.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Mr. Valiant, you’ve made a vast
improvement in the company you keep.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Look, the drawbridge – we’re gonna make
it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t see any bridge.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: That’s because you gotta <u>draw</u> it
first.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Eddie, come on.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Uh-oh… whoaaa…! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Are you two all right?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: These roads can be very treacherous at night,
especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The pot’s callin’ the kettle maniacal.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’ve had enough of your insolence! Put him in
my car. I think they’ll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme
factory.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: He’s not going anywhere. We’ll send the mobile
unit after him.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: The boinin’, the boinin’…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Oh, yeah… that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Roger!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Benny?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Doom’s got your wife and Valiant. He took
them to the Acme factory,</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Slide over, son. It looks like you’ve done
enough drivin’ for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Frisk them. See if they have the will.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Get your hands off me, you little
rodent!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No matter. I don’t expect the will to show up
in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
legally.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So you’re Cloverleaf?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No one person is Cloverleaf. We’re a vast
company with diverse interests… gasoline, tires, automobiles.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Come on, Doom. What would a company like
that want with Toontown?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: It wasn’t Toontown they wanted. It was my idea
of how to put the land to better use.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: In fact, they thought my concept so brilliant,
that they offered me the Directorship of Transportation. I’ve accepted.
Bring me Mr. Valiant’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: ‘Thanks for getting me out of the hoosegow.
Yosemite Sam’. How sweet.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Dip?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: That’s right. Enough to dip Toontown off the
face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>benny/roger rabbit</strong>: Dip Toontown?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: We gotta do something!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Roger, what’re you gonna do with that
gun?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’m gonna save them, of course. You go
for help. Find Dolores at the Terminal Bar. She’ll know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Well… all right…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: But you be careful now with that gun. This
ain’t no cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You’re sick, Doom. Where do people
like you come from?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Never mind where I come from. Just watch where
I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Don’t you think anyone’s gonna notice that
Toontown’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They won’t care. Who’s going to miss some
ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It’s time to make my move.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Right here where we’re standing, will be the
cornerstone of my idea… the cloverleaf – an elegant cement structure
that intertwines freeways.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell’s a freeway?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of
asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to
Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars
driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s what this is all about? Tell me,
who’s gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public
transportation in the country.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Not for long. We’re retiring the Red Cars.
People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they’ll have to. And when they
drive, they’ll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Why’d you bother to call it a
<u>free</u>way?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Has a nice ring. Too bad you two won’t be
around to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Get ’em up. All of you! Or I let the
Judge have it!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Roger, darling!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yes, it’s me, my dearest. I’d embrace
you but first I have to take care of some unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Put that gun down, you buck-toothed fool.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Go ahead. Give me an excuse to fill
you full of holes, pump you full of lead. How’m I doin’, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Real good, Rog… but maybe you better let me
take over.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
outrage.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You think you could get away with
this? Hah! We Toons may be idiotic, but we’re not stupid!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yes, justice, Judge Doom. The real
meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Well, this is turning out better than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Look, stars! Ready when you are,
Raoul.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I have missed you, Roger.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Tie the lovebirds together.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped…
then shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Watch out, you idiot… he’s going for the
gun!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You guys think this is real funny,
doncha? Eddie, do somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Before you pull the trigger, I want you to
know somethin’ about the guy you’re about to dip.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘His name is Roger Rabbit He’s got a crazy
habit…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘He likes to sing and dance and yuk So
brighten up and smile you schmuck…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘Now <u>my</u> name’s Eddie V I’m looney
too you’ll see’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘I walk with my hands And I shake with my
feet…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘I think dynamite Is swell to eat’.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: He’s lost his mind!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah, isn’t it great? Keep it up,
Eddie… you’re killing ‘em, you’re slayin’ ‘em, you’re knockin’ ’em
dead.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo…</p>
<p><strong>voltaire</strong>: Doom! Doom!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Roger, I want you to know I love
you. I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Be comforted in the knowledge that as
we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will be comingled for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Eddie, look out!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Holy shit, he’s a Toon!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not really. Only a Toon could think of
something as goofy as that freeway idea.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Is that so? Well, we’ll see who’s the goofy
one.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: By the way, when I killed your brother, Teddy,
I used to talk just like this.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: That’s right, me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Now Eddie’s gonna be deady, just like
Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: My hero!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Doom.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Jesus Christ… <u>that</u> was the
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
Maroon… and my brother.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
You’re bleedin’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s not blood. That’s ink. That goof
Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it’s comin’ ’through now,
I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: That’s because it’s
Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you
enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn’t punch you in the
nose. Great gag.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I’ll treat you to a new shirt. After all,
you did save Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Problem is without Marvin’s will,
the land still goes to Cloverleaf.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: That’s right. If only we knew what
happened to that will…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Say Roger, remember that love letter you
wrote your wife at the Ink &amp; Paint Club?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think you oughta read it to her.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Dear Jessy… How do I love thee? Let me
count the… I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body… Hey?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Keep reading…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, it’s the will. I, Marvin Acme, of
sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity
the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: … who have given me and the rest of
humanity so much mirth and merriment… the Toons.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, Eddie, you still think I’m a
patsy, a simp, a chump?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, kid, you’re a real hero.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I guess I am at that. Cigar?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: By the way, Roger, you were right about
your wife. She’s a good lady. I’m glad you got her back.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: And I’m glad you got your sense of
humor back. Think you’ll keep it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Only time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Pretty good cigar. Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: From this box here…</p>
<p><strong>porky pig</strong>: O-k-k-k, mmmove along. There’s nnnothin’
else to see. T-t-that’s it. T-t-that’s all, folks. Hmm, I l-l-like the
sound of that.</p>
<p><strong>porky pig</strong>: Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da… t-t-that’s all,
folks!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mommy’s going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I’m leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger. He’s going to take
very, very good care of you… … cause if he doesn’t, he’s going back to
the science lab!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Baby bye-bye…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, come back! You heard what your
mother said!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Coo-kie.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hang on, Baby. I’ll save you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cut, cut, cut!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: What the hell was wrong with that
take??</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Nothin’ with you, Baby Herman. It’s on
Roger… again! Hey! Could we lose the playback?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: What’s this, Roger?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A tweeting bird?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: That’s right, a tweeting bird. But what
does the script say? ‘Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees stars!’ Not birds,
stars!</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Aw, for cryin’ out loud, Roger! I’ll be
in my trailer… takin’ a nap!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I
know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’ve already dropped it on you
twenty-three times.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry about me. I can take
it.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m not worried about you. I’m worried
about the safe.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Starting tomorrow there’ll be no more roast
beef lunches. What happened to cheese sandwiches? I was raised on cheese
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: And tell that guy sleepin’ over there he’s
fired!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: It’s your wife’s brother, R.K.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Oh… tell him he’s promoted. But get him out
of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant, did you see the rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He was blowin’ his lines, all right. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: So what? He’s already put me three weeks
behind on the shooting schedule!</p>
<p><strong>costumer</strong>: Your reaction, R.K.?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No! That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: That’s funny. Put a homburg on him it’ll
even be funnier. Huh, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, that’d be a riot.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Boy, I hope what you have ain’t contagious
or I’ll be out of business.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: How much do you know about show business,
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Only there’s no business like it, no
business I know.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Yeah, and there’s no business as expensive.
I’m twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and
it’s all because that rabbit can’t keep his mind on his work. And you
know why?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: One too many safes dropped on his head?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Nah, that goes with the territory. He’s a
stunt bunny.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Here’s the problem… “Seen cooing over
calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit… wife of Maroon
star, Roger”. His wife’s a tramp, but he thinks she’s Betty Crocker. The
doubt’s eatin’ him up.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin’ I
can wise the rabbit up with.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t work in Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You don’t have to. The rabbit’s wife sings
at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink &amp; Paint Club. You
can catch her in action there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The job’s gonna cost you a hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: A hundred bucks? That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So’s the job.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: All right, all right… You got your hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Kinda jumpy aren’t you, Valiant? It’s just
Dumbo.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I got him on loan from Disney.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Aren’t you the lucky one…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: When will I hear from you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: As soon as is humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Damn Toons.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: What do I look like, a bank?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: So long, mister.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks for the cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, fellas, what’s the good word?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Lost my job.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Mule died.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, you know what they say about dames,
Augie…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So, makin’ dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well,
lemme remind ya pal, it was a dame who took a hundred bucks out of the
till so your landlord would’t throw you out of your dump. And it was a
dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And
it’s a dame who’s tired of waitin’ for you to straighten yourself out
and get a job!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Would this be the same dame who’s going to
feel awfully foolish when she finds out I’ve got her money.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five
before they check the books tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’ll have it in the morning. Now be a
sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Is this paper even good?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Check the scrawl.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: R.K. Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Maroon? Valiant, don’t tell me you’re
workin’ for a Toon? Who’s your client? Chilly Willy or Screwy
Squirrel?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get this straight, greaseball. I’m not
workin’ for a Toon! I’d never work for a Toon! Got that?</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: What’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Toon killed his brother.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Walt sent me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Like your monkey suit.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Wise ass…</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Will you listen to that? It’s a pip! I’m
thinking of callin’ it a Whoopee Cushion.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: No hard feelings, I hope. Put ’er there…</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Hand buzzer… real gasser.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: There’s a two drink minimum.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just as long as there’s no maximum.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Waiter, I’ll sign my check now.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s it for you, pops!</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: Calm down, son. Look, the ink is gone.</p>
<p><strong>geezer</strong>: See? It disappears.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, why don’t you make like the ink?</p>
<p><strong>cigarette girl</strong>: Cigars… cigarettes… Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Gee, it’s swell to see you, Eddie. We
miss you in Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Wish I could say the same. What’re you
doin’ here, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Work’s been slow for me since the
cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie… ‘Boop boop
be-doop’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who’s
Mr. Jocularity?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: That’s Marvin Acme, the gag king.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Shoulda guessed.</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: He comes here every night to see Jessica
Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Big on the musical comedy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>betty boop</strong>: Sounds like you ve never seen her,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>droopy</strong>: Hello, everybody. I hope you’re all having
as much fun as I am. I have a small announcement to make. Jessica Rabbit
will not be able to sing tonight.</p>
<p><strong>droopy</strong>: I was merely jesting. Without further ado…
here’s woman times two, Toontown’s own chanteuse par excellance… Jessica
Rabbit!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘You had plenty of money back You
let other woman make a fool Why don’t you do right. Like some other men
do… Get out of here and Get me the money too…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘Why don’t you do right. Like some
other men do…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘You ain’t got no money Ain’t got no
use for you…’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: ‘So get out of here… And get me the
money toooo!’</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Thanks for your lap.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Hey, whaddaya think you’re doin’,
chump?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Who’re you callin’ chump, chimp?</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: Oh, it’s da comedian…</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: And don’t lemme catch your peepin’ face
around here again. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Ooga-booga.</p>
<p><strong>acme</strong>: Are we going to play pattycake tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Marvin, I have a headache…</p>
<p><strong>acme</strong>: But you promised…</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, all right. But this time take
that hand buzzer off…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Pattycake! Pattycake!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Baker’s man… but no use ruinin’ a good pair
of shoes over it.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Take comfort, son, you’re not the first man
whose wife played pattycake on him.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I don’t believe it. I won’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: The pictures don’t lie. Mr. Valiant here
took them himself.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But Jessy… she’s the light of my life,
the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, you better start thinkin’ about
drinkin’ it black.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Frankly, I’m shocked. Marvin Acme’s been my
friend and neighbor for thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Who would have thought he was the Sugar
Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Well, the important thing now Roger, is to
put all this behind you. Drink this, son, you’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I know this all seems painful now, but
you’ll find someone new. Won’t he, Mr, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah. Good lookin’ guy like him.
Dames’ll be breakin’ his door down.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch… Mr. Maroon, I think I’ll be
goin’ now, so about the rest of my fee…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Sure, Valiant, sure…</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Being experienced in these matrimonial
matters, you have any advice for our friend here?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get
yourself a quickie divorce.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Divorce? Never!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Marriage is a two-way street and we’re
just experiencing a detour! Jessica and I are going to get back
together. We’re going to be happy! H-A-P-P-I!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: At least he took it well.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lieutenant Santino… how ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Tell me you didn’t do a snoop job for a
Toon named Roger the Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s what you woke me up for?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: You got trouble, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just haven’t been this close to Toontown
for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Let’s go, somebody wants to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: They say the rabbit got the safe idea
from a cartoon he was makin’ the other day.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What a gasser.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Wait here…</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: Say, didn’t you used to be Eddie
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Mr. Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I hope you’re proud of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: She likes you, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #2</strong>: When they drew her, they broke the
pencil.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Makes you wonder what in the world she was
doin’ with a guy who didn’t clean his fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>forensic #1</strong>: So… it’s blood.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: It’s not blood, it’s paint.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Is this man removing evidence from the scene
of a crime?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Uh… no, Judge Doom. Valiant here was
just about to hand it over, weren’t you, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Looks like the deceased grabbed a handful of
your client’s pantaloons, Mr. Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s not my client. I was workin’ for R.K.
Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the
rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said
nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that
true?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, pal, do I look like a
stenographer?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Watch your mouth, Eddie, he’s a
judge.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: The rabbit’s movements are fairly clear after
leaving the Maroon Studios. He ran across the street, jimmied this door
open, hoisted the safe on a block and tackle…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: … then stood out here waiting for his prey.
After he cold-bloodedly accomplished his task, he went home. He was
almost apprehended there by my men.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Men? They look more like weasles to me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift
for the work. The rabbit didn’t contact you by any chance, did he?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why would he contact me? I just took some
lousy pictures.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: So you wouldn’t have any idea where he might
be?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo’s very
nice this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’m surprised you aren’t more cooperative,
Mr. Valiant. A human has been murdered by a Toon. Don’t you appreciate
the magnitude of that? My goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to rein in
the insanity. To bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no
civilized person has ever been able to step foot. The only way to do
that is to make the Toons respect the law.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Judge Doom! Here, let me get that for
ya.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Why, you filthy little vagrant, you’ve soiled
my robe!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: It’s cleanin’ up real good. Judge.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You’ve defiled a symbol of justice.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Where’d this gargoyle come from anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: No one knows. He bought the election a
few years back. He’s been rulin’ Toontown ever since.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme go. I
think I hear my mother callin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Voltaire… the Gopher!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Hey, don’t I have any rights?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, you do… to a swift and speedy trial.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Court is now in session.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
assault and resisting arrest. How do you find him?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Guilty as charged. Case closed!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I hereby sentence you to the dip!</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Oh no, not the dip! Anything but the dip!
I’m too young to die…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s with the dip?</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: That’s how he gets rid of the
troublemakers. It’s a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint
remover. He calls it the… Final Solution.</p>
<p><strong>gopher</strong>: Help! Help! He…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They’re not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant. but
that’s how we handle things in Toontown. I would think you’d appreciate
that.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: After all, didn’t a Toon kill your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped
in it this time.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What are you complaining about? Here’s your
fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: Thirty-five years and all I got to show
for it is a ticket punch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s with Earl?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big
company called Cloverleaf Industries.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No kiddin’? Bought the Red Cars, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Bastards put him on notice.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Here’s to the pencil pushers. May they all
get lead poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: The old Number Six Line… who’da thought
they’d close that one down?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, get him down from there. He’s gonna
break his neck.</p>
<p><strong>trolleyman</strong>: Took you right to Toontown, it did.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I know, I know… poor S.O.B.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Do you think the rabbit did it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t wanna think. I wanna drink.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Make that a round.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: We don’t serve formula. Snookums.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: You serve martinis, doncha?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Make it dry. Baby doesn’t like to be
wet. You’re Valiant, right? The name’s Baby Herman.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I know who you are. Kinda out of your
neighborhood, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Yeah, I had to go slummin’. See, a
friend of mine’s bein’ framed.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: You don’t believe that. I mean. the
guy’s an idiot, a moron, a complete fool… but he’d never kill anyone. I
know the guy.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Thanks, doll.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh, a ladies man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
lust and a three-year-old dinkie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My problem is I come here to drink in
peace. So if you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: C’mon, Valiant, doesn’t this whole
thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a
mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah, Eddie, it’s not like you got an ad in
the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks for the vote of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: And another thing, the paper said no
will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he
promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So where is it then?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: Somebody took it from him. That’s what
this whole thing’s about.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The papers said the safe door was opened,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Stick to stuffin’ the olives, willya,
Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: My hunch is it was Maroon. He always
was after Acme’s property.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: No. But neither does Roger. That’s
Diablo Red. Roger’s pants are Sunrise Orange.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well, I’ll be…</p>
<p><strong>baby herman</strong>: So what’s your next move, Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My next move? That’s easy. I’m gettin’ up,
and I’m walkin’ out the door, and I’m goin’ home to bed.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So you’re not even gonna bother to find out
if the rabbit’s gettin’ framed?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s a Toon… who cares?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well, you used to care, Eddie. And it didn
t matter if a client’s skin was black, white, or painted!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I needed a place to hide. I’m in
trouble, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So I hear. Even talkin’ to you could get me
a rap for aiding and abetting.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry, Eddie, no one knows I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah? Then how’d you find my house?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, I asked the newsboy on the
corner. He didn’t know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally
the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: In other words, the whole goddamn world
knows you’re here! Out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Please, Eddie, don’t put me out. I
didn’t do it, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
not that way.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: After I left you, I went to see her at
the Ink &amp; Paint Club.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: She was on stage, so I found a piece
of paper and wrote her a love letter.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ’Dear Jessy. How do I love thee? Let
me count the ways. 1-1000, 2-1000, 3-1000…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, that wasn’t very nice.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It took me almost an hour to compose
that. But I decided not to leave it anyway. I’d read it in person, that
was my plan.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Look, pal, if you’re still here when I
finish this drink, I’m callin’ the police.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t do that! I’m innocent I tell ya.
The police’ll just dip me. They were waitin’ for me when I got home last
night. I ran.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If you’re so innocent, why’d you run?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, Eddie, I’m a rabbit. We always
run.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, this is the moment of truth! And
I’ve spoken the truth, but you won’t believe the truth. So I guess the
truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is slung. my fait is accompli.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Won’t anything change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The goddamn will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You mean you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It’s Toon Control!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get away from that window.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You’re gonna help me? How can I ever
thank you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: For starters… don’t ever kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Police…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’ll talk to ’em. Find a place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not in there. That’s the first place
they’ll look.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Eddie Valiant… you’re under arrest!
Just kidding…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You idiot. I lost the key for those
cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: We got him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey! What do you think you’re doin’?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you’re not a
Toon.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Don’t ever forget that.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: This way, goof…</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Scent’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Pssst.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Funny… I could swear I smelled
rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: News flash… Hollywood. Citywide Toonhunt
for Roger Rabbit, suspect in Acme slaying. Police describe him as short,
cuddly… and psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Mother Mary…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hurry, hurry…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
is?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Charmed, enchanted, pleasure’s all
mined.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Where’d you find him?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The Toon Fairy left him under my
pillow.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He’s a riot.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not handcuffed to
him. Anybody in the back room?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So you decided to help him after all?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I oughta have my head examined. Will you
hold still?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Does this help?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You mean to tell me you coulda taken your
hand outta that cuff at any time?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, no, not any time. Only when it
was funny.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Are you always this funny, or only on days
when you’re wanted for murder?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: My philosophy is if you don’t have a
sense of humor, you’re better off dead.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah… well you just might get your
wish.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Can you get him out of it, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme
bad enough to get this.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Acme’s will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: So that’s what this little drama is
all about.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the
sound mind, your wife the sound body.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I resent that innuendo! My wife is
completely innocent.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but
innocent isn’t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: So what’s the scam, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants
Acme’s property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: The habeus corpus is thickening.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don’t think
they got the will.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that
night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the
body.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Maybe they just took it out of his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Then why’d they bother to crack the safe?
You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won’t open.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in
the safe before they killed him?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Because he’s not forty feet tall. The safe
was up on the ceiling, remember?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow
maybe I’ll go down to probate court and see who’s sniffin’ around Acme’s
estate?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, do that. I’m gonna go rattle Maroon’s
cage.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: What should I do? Who should I see?
Where should I go?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Nothin’, no one, nowhere,</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown, but
not at the Maroon Studio.</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
aside, Roger Rabbit may have been willing to play second banana to an
ankle-biter, but I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: This’ll be fine, huh, Augie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Forget about the prices, pal. If you want
the shrimp cocktail, you have a shrimp cocktail. Excuse me, Augie, I’ve
got a little table-hopping to do.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I think you should know, R.K., we’re in
negotiations for Bugs to star in his own series at Warner Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Trying to scare up a bidding war between me
and Jack Warner, eh? Well, it won’t work. I’ll call William Morris and
I’ll have ’em put out a rabbit call the likes of which this town’s never
seen!</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: It’s your dime, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: And stop callin’ me Doc!</p>
<p><strong>bugs bunny</strong>: Eh, sure, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant? What’re you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I Just thought I’d drop by and show you a
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: I’ve already seen your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you
might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Anyway… enjoy your lunch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How is that, Augie, pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: It’s me. Valiant says there’s a will. I
don’t know what he’s trying to pull…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Somebody’s gonna have to take care of
him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The old man had it at the club that night.
That’s right. Yeah, I’m sure. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Iris… cancel my appointments this
afternoon. I’ll be at Forest Lawn.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You did great, Augie. Have another shrimp
cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Love that Red Car.</p>
<p><strong>foghorn leghorn</strong>: Today we commit the body of brother
Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold ground. We shed no tears for we know
that Marvin is going to a better place. That high, high, I say that
high-larious place up in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: A-men!</p>
<p><strong>foghorn leghorn</strong>: Give us a sign, brother Herman,
that you’ve arrived…</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: Round and round the mullberry bush, The
monkey chased the weasle…</p>
<p><strong>toons</strong>: The monkey raid it all was in fun. POP! Goes
the weasle.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: So… trying to pull a fast one on me,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Somethin’ you want, mister?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not anymore…</p>
<p><strong>mover #1</strong>: I don’t know about you, but it makes me
sick to think of these beautiful pianos gettin’ chopped into match
sticks every night by those screwy ducks.</p>
<p><strong>mover #2</strong>: And they call it entertainment.</p>
<p>****: Phooey! Out of tune again!</p>
<p><strong>daffy duck</strong>: Not to worry, Donald. We can fix that
with my sledgehammer.</p>
<p><strong>donald duck</strong>: Never mind, Daffy. I’ve got an axe in
my dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Girl’s gotta protect herself.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: And here I tought we had mice.</p>
<p><strong>gorilla</strong>: … I caught him rummagin’ around in here.
Then I called you, Judge, on a counta you be da one we pay juice to.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You did the right thing, Bongo.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Being caught breaking and entering is not very
good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for,
Mr. Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Ask her…</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Last week some heavy breather wanted
one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that’s what he was after?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda
broken into Frederick’s of Hollywood. I was lookin’ for Marvin Acme’s
will.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the
probate is in my court.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He had a will, all right. She took it off
Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her
loving husband to take the fall.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk
or punch drunk. Probably both.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: These are bold accusations, Mr. Valiant. I
hope you have some proof?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I found the cover the will came in behind
the dressing table.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: They must’ve taken it off me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The other people who were in here lookin’
for the will. I woulda caught ’em if Cheetah here hadn’t interrupted
me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Take it easy, Bongo. We’ll handle Mr. Valiant
our own way… downtown.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I’d
be more than glad to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Oh, not that downtown. Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re not takin’ me to downtown
Toontown?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Indeed we are. We’ll continue the
interrogation there.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I ain’t tellin’ you nothin’! Get me
Santino.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You’re a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant. Very
pig-headed. Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the
Toontown station…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No… you bastards! Leggo of me!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: What’re you shakin’ for? Didn’t you have
a good time last time you were here?</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: Soo-eey! Soo-eey!</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Let him go, boys. I think he’s got the
message.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Here’s one for the books… a Toon wearin’ human
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Earl… it’s me, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Eddie? Jesus, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Toon cops worked me over.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Boy, I’ll say. They gave you a real
Toon-a-Roo.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What am I, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re a pig… a happy-go-lucky pig.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not much. It’s hard to talk.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the
back so you won’t cause as much of a commotion.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Can I, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: Go ahead, darling. Take your bat.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hi, Mr. Pig. If I hit you on the head, will you
make me a cuckoo bird?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Kid, if you hit me on the head, I’m gonna
throw you out this window.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the
doorbell, but I guess you couldn’t hear it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s because I don’t have a doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh… well, I… I just had to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Okay, you’ve seen me. Now give me a
towel.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: What’s that thing?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Come on, lady, haven’t you ever seen a mole
before?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Toons aren’t given
imperfections.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No? I guess we’re not counting lying,
stealing and murder.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You’ve got the wrong idea about me.
I’a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I’ll
pay you anything.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, I’ll bet you would. You gotta have
the rabbit to make the scam work.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: No, no, no… I love my husband.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin’
outside your little hutch, holdin’ a carrot cake waitin’ for hubby to
come home.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, please don’t make fun of me, Mr,
Valiant. You don’t know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I
do.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, well, you don’t know how hard it is
bein’ a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I’m not bad, I’m just drawn that
way.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m not complainin’. But give me credit.
I’m the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin’ pattycake,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Maroon came to me. He told me he’d
fire Roger if I didn’t do it. I went along with him for Roger’s sake. It
was only pattycake, after all.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So altruistic.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: It’s the truth. Why won’t you
believe it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Cause I don’t take Acme Dumb Pills. I don’t
know what you’re up to, lady, but I’m gonna nail you for the Acme
murder.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: If I’m as bad as you think, what’s
stopping me from just killing you right now?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: This cup of turpentine right here. Go for
that gun in your purse and I’m gonna let you have it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Oh, Mr, Valiant, please… you’re my
only hope.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I’m weak… you’re strong. Can’t you
find a place somewhere in your heart to help me?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Dabblin’ in watercolors, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Lemme guess… your cousin from Des
Moines?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Perhaps I should go.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Must you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Goodbye, Eddie… don’t hate me.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That was the rabbit’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The rabbit’s wife? Wanna tell me what she
was doin’ with her arms around you?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Probably lookin’ for a good place to stick
a knife.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I just stopped by to tell you that I
checked out the Acme probate.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maroon, right?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Nope. It’s that Cloverleaf outfit
again.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell would they want with a gag
factory?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Got me. But unless the will shows up by
Friday midnight, it’s theirs.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’s that comin’ from the bar?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Sounds like singin’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>roger rab3it</strong>: ‘The merry-go-round broke down But you
don’t see me frown…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘Things turned out fine And now she’s
mine…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘… Cause the merry-go-round Went
round… Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘My name is Roger Rabbit I’ve got a
crazy habit I like to sing and dance and yuk…’</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: ‘… So brighten up and smile You
schmuck’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, don’t I get an encore?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why, you crazy Toon… I’ve been out there
riskin’ my neck for you. I come back here and you’re singin’ and
dancin’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But that’s my calling, my purpose, my
raison d’etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh… and believe me,
those people needed a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: And when they’re done laughin’ , they’re
gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Angelo? He’s a pal, a chum…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got
outta prison.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well… I still don’t think he’d turn me
in.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Just because you got ’em to laugh?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A laugh can be a powerful thing,
Eddie. Sometimes it’s the only weapon we have in life.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
variety.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’ve met some cynical and miserable
humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, right now it’s gonna be your
funereal.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Go ahead and throw that punch. But
you’d be more successful with a punch line.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re driving me crazy, you know that?
Let’s go… you ruined this as a hiding place.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’m looking for a rabbit. He was last seen in
this neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You couldn’t miss him. Buck teeth. Orange
pants. About yea big.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: There’s no rabbit here, so don’t harass my
customers.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I didn’t come here to harass. I came here to
reward.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Hey, I seen a rabbit…</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: He’s right here in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>angelo</strong>: Say ’ello, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: My pal.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Now we’ll see who laughs best…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Valiant? Why is it that whenever my men smell
a rabbit, you’re there?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Must be my cologne… Eau Dc Carrot.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #1</strong>: He’s in here all right, boss.</p>
<p><strong>weasle #2</strong>: Youse want we should take the place
apart?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No, Sergeant. That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I know a trick that no Toon can resist.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You know, Doom, I don’t know who’s Toonier,
you or the rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Shave… and… a haircut…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Two… bits! Uh… oh…</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: Oyez… oyez… oyez… court is now in
session.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold blooded
murder of a human… Marvin Acme. The jury will direct their attention to
exhibits A, B, and C.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Motive, evidence, modus operandi. How do you
find the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Guilty as charged. Case closed!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: For this heinous crime, I sentence you to the
dip!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: No, no. not the dip! Eddie, tell him I
didn’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t think it’s gonna matter. Sorry,
pal, I tried.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Yes, and for that you’re charged with aiding
and abetting. But we’ll let Santino handle that.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey, doesn’t the rabbit even get a last
request?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think you want a drink. How about it,
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Well, why not? I’m feeling magnanimous
tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my
career as a jurist. I’m retiring to take a new role in the private
sector.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah? Well, don’t expect the Toons to give
you a gold watch.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Here you go, kid… say hi to Casper for
me.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: But, Eddie, you know what happens
when…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Drink it, jerk. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: After them you fools…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin’.
Nothin’ like usin’ the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I’m so smart, how come I’m runnin’ from
the law with a Toon?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: If you effect my extrication, I could
offer you some carburetion.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Well… what’re we waitin’ for, the William
Tell Overture?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: You don’t have to do nothin’…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Uh… except hang onto your hat.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: That’s what I was afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Read all about it, Benny’s back in
town!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Going up…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
escaped convicts. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, Benny, what were you in for?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Reckless driving. Do you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hard to imagine.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Hold your breath, babies…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but is
the sky falling or what?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Grab it, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The brakes! The brakes!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Forget the brakes, who brought the water
wings?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Maybe it’s my imagination, but I always
seem to run better after I’ve had a wash. Now where can I drop you
cats?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Thanks, Benny.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: If you ever need me, just stick out your
thumb.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Valiant and Valiant? Who’s the other
Valiant?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: My brother. Get inside.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: So what’s our plan, our scenario, our
modus operandi?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: We can’t do anything till it’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Guess you haven’t been here in a
while. ‘Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor’.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Say, who’s this guy laughin’?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, I didn’t recognize you… I’ve
never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin’ the rabbit
ears?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What is this, Twenty Questions?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m gonna get some sleep. I suggest you do
the same.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you
for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, you shamuses are a tough
audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid,
embittering?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You wanna know? Well, since you’re so
goddamn curious, I’ll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: A Toon? Noooo.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed
Bambi’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous,
despicable… a smear on the drafting board.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and
Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn’t see the bad in
‘em. And when this guy was accused of knockin’ over the First National
Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found
out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he
was wise. He got the drop on us… literally.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Safe?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into
Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Get away from there.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Wrong number?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I was hopin’ you’d be there. Maroon’s
called here about four times. He says he’s gotta talk to you tonight. He
says he can help you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Are you gonna call him, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What’ve I got to lose? You okay,
Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yeah… they closed me down for a coupla
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’ll work out just fine. When this thing
is over, I’ll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maroon? Whaddaya want?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Have you got the will?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Maybe. Why?</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Meet me at my studio at nine o’clock. If
you’ve got the will maybe we can stop this thing.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Gee, Eddie, you’re not gonna go, are
ya? Maroon’ll be layin’ for ya at nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s why I’ll be there at 8:45.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I tell you what, maybe I better come
with you.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You know, Eddie, I’m not as much of a
chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How much is a shave and a haircut,
Roger?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Two bits.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I rest my case.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: If I don’t make it back here by ten…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: … I’d head for Cucamonga.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Cucamonga? I don’t know anybody in
Cucamonga.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Steady, R.K., that stuff’s eighteen years
old.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: Valiant! You surprised me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That was the idea.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You’re not too good at this, are you,</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No… I’m not. I’m a cartoon maker, not a
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, everybody needs a hobby.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had
nothin’ to do with Acme gettin’ killed. I just wanted to sell my studio.
But they wouldn’t buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he
wouldn’t. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the
rabbit’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: But then it all went to hell. I been around
Toons all my life. I can’t sit around and see them all destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You got the will in there, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: You tricked me, damn you!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: There’s no time to take it easy! You don’t
realize the diabolical mind we’re dealing with!</p>
<p><strong>maroon</strong>: If I don’t get that will by midnight
tonight, Toontown’s just gonna be land for the free…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: And the home of the brave?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #2</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ’46.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #3</strong>: Who won the war?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #4</strong>: Who do you think, dummy?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #5</strong>: Welcome back, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>dum-dum #6</strong>: Where you been the last five years?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Drunk.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Feelin’ frisky tonight, boys?</p>
<p><strong>dum-dums</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … From the tippy tip top of
Toontown’s Tip Top Club, this is Mellow Melody Matinee. Here’s our
favorite cricket, Jimmy, with ‘Give A Little Whistle’.</p>
<p><strong>jiminy cricket</strong>: ‘When you get in trouble, and you
don’t know right from wrong…’</p>
<p><strong>jiminy cricket</strong>: ‘… Give a little whistle Give a
little whistle…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I hate Toontown…</p>
<p><strong>wolf</strong>: Helloooo, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Don’t shoot, Eddie. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell are you doin’ in there?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
When I heard those shots, I thought I’d help you and investigate the
inside of this trunk.</p>
<p><strong>roger ra13bit</strong>: Hey, what’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I’m making sure you don’t help me
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I guess they didn’t clean up after the last
moider.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Don’t move, Valiant.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well… I always figured I’d get it in
Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I think I got him.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You shot Roger.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: That’s not Roger. It’s one of Doom’s
men. He killed R.K. Maroon.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Don’t worry, you’re not the first.
We better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hmmm… What would be the harm if I took
her for a spin?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Ah… the open road.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: It was Doom who killed Acme, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I didn’t know who I could trust.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: We’re even. By the way, I did find your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: He’s right here in the…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: … car.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hi, Roger Rabbit. Love your work.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: How did you get onto Doom?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Marvin told me. Doom was after his
land. Ne was afraid. That’s why he brought me his will.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: When I opened up the blue envelope,
all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: A joker to the end.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Looks like our goose is cooked, our
hash is slung, our fait is accompli…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell
me somethin’, what’d you ever see in that guy anyway?</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: He made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Well, do you prefer to die this way or that
way?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Benny.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Mr. Valiant, you’ve made a vast
improvement in the company you keep.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Look, the drawbridge – we’re gonna make
it.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I don’t see any bridge.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: That’s because you gotta draw it
first.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Eddie, come on.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Uh-oh… whoaaa…! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Are you two all right?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: These roads can be very treacherous at night,
especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: The pot’s callin’ the kettle maniacal.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’ve had enough of your insolence! Put him in
my car. I think they’ll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme
factory.</p>
<p><strong>weasle</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: He’s not going anywhere. We’ll send the mobile
unit after him.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: The boinin’, the boinin’…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Oh, yeah… that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Roger!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Benny?</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Doom’s got your wife and Valiant. He took
them to the Acme factory,</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Slide over, son. It looks like you’ve done
enough drivin’ for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Frisk them. See if they have the will.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Get your hands off me, you little
rodent!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No matter. I don’t expect the will to show up
in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
legally.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: So you’re Cloverleaf?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No one person is Cloverleaf. We’re a vast
company with diverse interests… gasoline, tires, automobiles.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Come on, Doom. What would a company like
that want with Toontown?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: It wasn’t Toontown they wanted. It was my idea
of how to put the land to better use.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: In fact, they thought my concept so brilliant,
that they offered me the Directorship of Transportation. I’ve accepted.
Bring me Mr. Valiant’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: ‘Thanks for getting me out of the hoosegow.
Yosemite Sam’. How sweet.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Dip?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: That’s right. Enough to dip Toontown off the
face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>benny/roger rabbit</strong>: Dip Toontown?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: We gotta do something!</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Roger, what’re you gonna do with that
gun?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I’m gonna save them, of course. You go
for help. Find Dolores at the Terminal Bar. She’ll know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: Well… all right…</p>
<p><strong>roadster</strong>: But you be careful now with that gun. This
ain’t no cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: You’re sick, Doom. Where do people
like you come from?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Never mind where I come from. Just watch where
I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Don’t you think anyone’s gonna notice that
Toontown’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: They won’t care. Who’s going to miss some
ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: It’s time to make my move.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Right here where we’re standing, will be the
cornerstone of my idea… the cloverleaf – an elegant cement structure
that intertwines freeways.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: What the hell’s a freeway?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of
asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to
Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars
driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s what this is all about? Tell me,
who’s gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public
transportation in the country.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Not for long. We’re retiring the Red Cars.
People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they’ll have to. And when they
drive, they’ll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Why’d you bother to call it a
freeway?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Has a nice ring. Too bad you two won’t be
around to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Get ’em up. All of you! Or I let the
Judge have it!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Roger, darling!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yes, it’s me, my dearest. I’d embrace
you but first I have to take care of some unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Put that gun down, you buck-toothed fool.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Go ahead. Give me an excuse to fill
you full of holes, pump you full of lead. How’m I doin’, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Real good, Rog… but maybe you better let me
take over.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
outrage.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You think you could get away with
this? Hah! We Toons may be idiotic, but we’re not stupid!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yes, justice, Judge Doom. The real
meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Well, this is turning out better than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Look, stars! Ready when you are,
Raoul.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: I have missed you, Roger.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Tie the lovebirds together.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped…
then shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Watch out, you idiot… he’s going for the
gun!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: You guys think this is real funny,
doncha? Eddie, do somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Before you pull the trigger, I want you to
know somethin’ about the guy you’re about to dip.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘His name is Roger Rabbit He’s got a crazy
habit…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ’He likes to sing and dance and yuk So
brighten up and smile you</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘Now my name’s Eddie V I’m looney too
you’ll see’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘I walk with my hands And I shake with my
feet…’</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: ‘I think dynamite Is swell to eat’.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: He’s lost his mind!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah, isn’t it great? Keep it up,
Eddie… you’re killing ‘em, you’re slayin’ ‘em, you’re knockin’ ’em
dead.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo…</p>
<p><strong>voltaire</strong>: Doom! Doom!</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Roger, I want you to know I love
you. I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Be comforted in the knowledge that as
we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will be comingled for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Eddie, look out!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Holy shit, he’s a Toon!</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Not really. Only a Toon could think of
something as goofy as that freeway idea.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Is that so? Well, we’ll see who’s the goofy
one.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: By the way, when I killed your brother, Teddy,
I used to talk just like this.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: That’s right, me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Now Eddie’s gonna be deady, just like
Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: My hero!</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Doom.</p>
<p><strong>lt. santino</strong>: Jesus Christ… that was the Judge?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
Maroon… and my brother.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
You’re bleedin’.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: That’s not blood. That’s ink. That goof
Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it’s comin’ ’through now,
I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: That’s because it’s
Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you
enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn’t punch you in the
nose. Great gag.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I’ll treat you to a new shirt. After all,
you did save Toontown.</p>
<p><strong>jessica rabbit</strong>: Problem is without Marvin’s will,
the land still goes to Cloverleaf.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: That’s right. If only we knew what
happened to that will…</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Say Roger, remember that love letter you
wrote your wife at the Ink &amp; Paint Club?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: I think you oughta read it to her.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Dear Jessy… How do I love thee? Let me
count the… I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body… Hey?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Keep reading…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Hey, it’s the will. I, Marvin Acme, of
sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity
the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters…</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: … who have given me and the rest of
humanity so much mirth and merriment… the Toons.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: Well, Eddie, you still think I’m a
patsy, a simp, a chump?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: No, kid, you’re a real hero.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: I guess I am at that. Cigar?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: By the way, Roger, you were right about
your wife. She’s a good lady. I’m glad you got her back.</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: And I’m glad you got your sense of
humor back. Think you’ll keep it?</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Only time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>valiant</strong>: Pretty good cigar. Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>roger rabbit</strong>: From this box here…</p>
<p><strong>porky pig</strong>: O-k-k-k, mmmove along. There’s nnnothin’
else to see. T-t-that’s it. T-t-that’s all, folks.</p>
<p>****: Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.</p>
<p><strong>porky pig</strong>: Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da… t-t-that’s all,
folks!</p>
