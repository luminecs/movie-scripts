<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How much does your life weigh?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Imagine for a second that you’re carrying a
backpack… I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders… You feel
them? Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your
life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves.
The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances,
lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at
this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff
it all in… Your car, get it in there… Your home, whether you have a
studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that
backpack.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Now try to walk.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Kinda hard, isn’t it? This is what we do to
ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can’t even
move. And make no mistake - Moving is living. 2.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Now, I’m going to set your backpack on fire.
What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who
can’t remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let
everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It’s kind
of exhilarating isn’t it? That is how I approach every day.</p>
<p><strong>female flight attendant</strong>: Do you want the cancer?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p>****: Do you want the cancer?</p>
<p><strong>female flight attendant</strong>: The can, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh… No. Um, no thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excellent question. Who the fuck am I? Poor
Steve has worked here for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He’s never had a meeting with me before…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: …or passed me in the hall…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … or told me a story in the break room….</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And that’s because I don’t work here. I work
for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve’s boss…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … who don’t have the balls to sack their own
employees. And in some cases, for good reason. Because, people do crazy
shit when they get fired.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And that’s where I come in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What did I… do? What could I have done
differently here?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is not an assessment of your
productivity. It’s important not to personalize this.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Steve, I want you to review this packet. Take
it seriously. I think you’re going to find a lot of answers in
there.</p>
<p>****: Oh, I’m sure it’s going be really helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look, anybody who ever built an empire, or
changed the world, sat where you are now. And it’s because they sat
there that they were able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m going to need your key card.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Take the day. Put together your personal
things. Talk to your co- workers. Tomorrow, go out and get some
exercise. Go for a jog. Give yourself routines and pretty soon you’ll
find your legs.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wait, how do I get in touch with you?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll be in touch soon. This is
just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’ll never see Steve again. 6.</p>
<p><strong>checkout girl</strong>: Do you have your Hilton Honors Card
with you?</p>
<p><strong>checkout girl</strong>: Oh my God… Do you like, live, at the
Hilton?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is where I live.</p>
<p><strong>airport clerk</strong>: Pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Bingham.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: When I run my card, the system automatically
prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement.</p>
<p><strong>airport clerk</strong>: Pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Bingham.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Had my status simply been gold or God-forbid,
silver. I might have gotten a hello or a smile… Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Loyalty is earned and rewarded with these
small touches. It’s these kinds of systemized friendly touches that keep
my world in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut to:</strong>: 8.</p>
<p><strong>admirals club hostess</strong>: Welcome back,
Mr. Bingham.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: All the things you probably hate about
travelling - The recycled air. The artificial lighting. The digital
juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the
warm reminders that I am home.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Ryan Bingham’s office.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas
City.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: They are completely out of all full sized
sedans… 9.</p>
<p>****: Did you?…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable #1
Gold Club status and years in the program. They are moving mountains to
see you in a Sebring.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Fair enough. Any other messages?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Your sister Kara called. Needs to speak
urgently about your sister’s wedding. I told her you were midair and not
even I knew your final destination.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: And you got an invitation to speak at
GoalQuest in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: GoalQuest twenty?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Every once in a while I do speaking
engagements. Motivational kind of stuff. But GoalQuest… We’re talking
major Tony Robbins shit. 10.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: It’s got a hologram. They’re calling it Dos
Equis. That’s some pretty major Tony Robbins shit there.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Talk about burying the lead.</p>
<p>****: I’ll check in when…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for you…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I… ah, fuck…</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: How’s the road warrior?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Twenty minutes from boarding into a world of
bliss.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Great numbers out of Phoenix. You
know Big Auto is going to drop another 10K this month.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I
could have you in five places at once. I need you back in Omaha by the
end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I thought you needed me everywhere. 11.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: We got something big - Game
changer.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t know why you ever bring me in.
Wherever I go, the money follows. Let me plant seeds, they’ll grow to
Oaks.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I’m thinking of planting seeds right
now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What are we talking about here?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p>****: Today, I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s me, hanging up on you.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Good. I love that sound.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: To know me is to fly with me. I’m the aisle,
you’re the window - trapped.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We start chatting, impersonally at first. Our
moderate politics, our sinking opinions on the American service
industry. 12.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I tip you off
to a rib joint in Fort Worth.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You tell me your best joke. I’ve heard it
before, but listen anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Nothing like turbulence to cement a bond. Soon
you’re telling me about family.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Your wife just went back to work but you can’t
intervene because you sure could use the extra paycheck and besides,
last June she read some book and woke up one morning a feminist.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And that if your windfall ever came through,
you’d quit and spend the rest of your days restoring vintage speedboats.
The water. That’s where you belong.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We exchange cards and slot them next to
countless others.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Fast friends aren’t my only friends, but my
best friends.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sad? Not really. We’re a busy bunch. I’m
peaceful. I’m in my element here. I suppose I’m a sort of mutation, a
new species. I live between the margins of my itineraries.</p>
<p>****: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Hi Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Every family has one person who is the glue.
The one who keeps the genealogy in check. That’s my sister Kara - The
glue.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey Kara.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just fine. You? The kids?</p>
<p>****: Missy’s outstanding. Matthew made varsity. How’s the road?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: That’s good. So, Ryan?</p>
<p>****: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: I didn’t even want to have to ask you for
this, because I know how you are about… doing things for others…</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: But we’re coming in on three weeks to go for
Julie’s wedding and there’s something we could really use your help on.
15.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: We’ve been sending people these kits so they
can print out photos of Julie and Jim on cardboard, and take photos of
them in interesting places kind of like that gnome in the French
movie.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>****: Because it’s Julie’s wedding… and she thinks it’s fun. Does it
matter why?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How is Julie?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Would you call her? She thinks you’ve turned
to butter - Disappeared. You’re awfully isolated, the way you live.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Isolated? I’m surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Your assistant told me you’re going to be in
Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Did he?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Can you get a photo of the cut-out in front of
the Luxor Pyramid?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That place is a shit hole. No one stays
there.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Jesus, Ryan, I’m not asking you to check in.
Can you just take a stupid photo?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m going to try my best.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Well, thank you for trying your best. 16.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You’re satisfied with Maestro?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, I am.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: They’re stingy with their miles. I like
Hertz.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hertz keeps its vehicles too long. If a car’s
over twenty-thousand miles, I won’t drive it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Maestro doesn’t instant check out. I like to
park and go.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hertz doesn’t guarantee Navigation.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Funny, you don’t seem like a girl who needs
directions.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I hate asking for directions. That’s why I get
a Nav.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The new outfit, Colonial, isn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Is that a joke?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Their kiosk placement is a joke. 17.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Never have available upgrades.</p>
<p>****: It’s basically a fleet of shit boxes - Don’t know how they’re
still in business.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alex.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: So are you going to join me?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into
this palace.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hilton offers equal value and better food -
But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: They got you with the cookies?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m a sucker for simulated hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There’s actually an industry term for that.
It’s a mixture of faux and homey. It’s faumey.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh my God. I’ve heard about these, but never
seen one in person. Is this a…?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Concierge Key. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I love the weight.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that
puppy came in.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.
Sixty thou a year, domestic.</p>
<p>****: That’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t patronize me. What’s your total?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s a personal question.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh please…</p>
<p>****: I hardly know you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Show some hubris. Impress me.</p>
<p>****: I bet it’s huge.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p>****: Is it this big? … this big? 19.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Let’s just say I’ve got a number in mind and I
haven’t hit it yet.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This is pretty fucking sexy.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I hope it doesn’t cheapen our
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We’re two people who get turned on by elite
status. We may have to settle for cheap.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There’s nothing cheap about loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I really have to start throwing these out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We can always use that room with the ice
machine.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Good call on the towel rack.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the
sofa cushions.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I was improvising.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Too bad we didn’t make it to the closet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We got to do this again.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m in Newark on the 12th, Madesto on the
13th, Oklahoma City on the 15th.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Any Southwest? I’m swinging through
Albuquerque the week of the 16th?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, but I’ll be in Florida by the 20th.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Miami?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Ft. Lauderdale.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I should probably go back to my room so I can
wake up in my bed. 21.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I think that’s the lady like thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Last year, I spent three hundred twenty two
days on the road.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Which means that I had to spend forty three
miserable days at home.</p>
<p><strong>nosey neighbor</strong>: Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>nosey neighbor</strong>: Feels like it’s been months, busy
man. We missed you at our Summer party.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, sorry I couldn’t be there.</p>
<p><strong>nosey neighbor</strong>: We’ve been trying to get a vote on
the new landscaping. Can I e-mail you the plans…? We’d love to get a
final tally.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s fine. Really. I’ll go with the
majority.</p>
<p><strong>nosey neighbor</strong>: Sometimes I forget that you even
live here. You could probably save money and move into a hotel. 23.</p>
<p>****: I looked into it, but the IRS requires a permanent address for
employment. Otherwise, they classify you as a vagrant.</p>
<p><strong>nosey neighbor</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hey neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey yourself.</p>
<p><strong>dianne</strong>: I signed for this while you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thanks. Hope it wasn’t a bother.</p>
<p>****: They seem happy.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s my sister. She’s getting married. Haven’t
met the guy yet.</p>
<p><strong>dianne</strong>: Lots of luck. 24.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I know, right?</p>
<p><strong>dianne</strong>: It’s good to see you. Feels like a while
this time.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, you want to come over tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dianne</strong>: Actually, I kind of started seeing
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, that’s… that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>dianne</strong>: Yeah, we’re having drinks tonight if you
want to come over.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s okay… I’ think I’ll settle in.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Just thrilled to have everyone under
one roof. Welcome home boys.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I know there’s are lot of whispering
about why we’re all here.</p>
<p>****: 25.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Retailers are down twenty percent.
Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn’t have a heartbeat.
This is our moment. It’s one of the worst times on record for America…
and I don’t want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how
we missed this window of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Now, last Summer we received a
dynamite young woman by way of Cornell. She challenged us with some big
ideas. My first reaction was, who does this kid think she is? But when I
started to give a listen, I was pretty knocked out. So now, with a
little peek into our future - Natalie Keener.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: If there’s one word I want to leave you
with today, it’s this…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Glocal.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Our global must become local.</p>
<p><strong>power point slide</strong>: A slide shows PEOPLE X 250.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: This company keeps twenty three people on
the road, at least two hundred fifty days a year. It’s expensive and
it’s inefficient. When I came to Craig three months ago with this, he
told me, and quite astutely - it’s only a problem if you have a
solution.</p>
<p>****: 26.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Well, today I stand before you with jus
that.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You all know Ned in reception.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Today, I’m going to fire Ned.</p>
<p>****: Sorry, Ned. I’m sure H.R. will hire you back this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Ned could be any employee in any one of our
client’s locations worldwide. Strategy packets would be shipped in
advance. Ned would be given a seat and find one of our transition
specialists waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Laskin, the reason we’re having this
conversation today is your position is no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I don’t understand. I’m fired?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hearing the words “You’ve been let go” is
never easy. Change is always scary. But consider the following - Anybody
who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now.
And it’s because they sat there that they were able to do it.</p>
<p>****: That’s my fucking line. 27.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, what happens now?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: This is the first step of a process that
will end with you in a new job that fulfills you.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yeah, but, how does it work?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I want you to take that packet in front of
you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Review it. All the answers you’re looking
for are inside. Start filling out the necessary information and before
you know it, you’ll be on your way to new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Now Ned, I’m going to need you to go back
to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favor to me,
I’d appreciate it if you didn’t spread the news just yet. Panic doesn’t
help anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Have a good day, Mr. Laskin and good luck
with your future.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Give it up for Ned.</p>
<p><strong>power point</strong>: An animation of one monitor becoming
multiple monitors, all tied into a central switch board in the middle of
a map of the country.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You can start the morning in Boston, stop
in Dallas over lunch and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the
price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by
eighty-five percent… And most importantly to you guys on the road… No
more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa… No more hours lost to weather
delays… You get to come home.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Tell me you’re not taking this seriously.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Yeah, that’s why we brought the
entire company in from the road - Because we’re not taking this
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense. It’s…</p>
<p>****: … completely impersonal.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Who am I even talking to?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There’s a methodology to what I do. A reason
why it works.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing it
for years. Just like anything, there’s a few months of transition, but
everyone settles in.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Who are you taking off the road? 29.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: You don’t get it. You’re grounded,
Ryan. Everyone is. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves
people devastated, but there’s a dignity to the way I do it.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Stabbing people in the chest instead
of the back?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, why don’t you come in.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Great job in there, Nat.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Thank you. How’s everyone taking it?</p>
<p>****: Look, I appreciate your… zeal. And you have some good ideas.
But you know nothing of the realities of my job. Sure, you can set up an
iChat… but you don’t know how people think.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Actually, I minored in psychology.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>****: Okay kiddo, fire me. 30.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Ryan, stop it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She’s going to be doing this on a regular
basis. You don’t want to know if she can fire somebody?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: She just fired Ned.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: My dog could fire Ned.</p>
<p>****: Fire me.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s okay, I got this.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you that
your position is no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: My name is Miss Keener and I’m here today
to discuss your future.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: My future? I don’t know you. The only person
who can fire me is Craig Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this for
him.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me
and he’s the only one who can fire me. I’m going to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Bingham… 31.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You can’t follow me… You’re on a computer
screen. Remember?</p>
<p>****: Ryan…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Try again. Fire me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I just did.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Actually, you didn’t. Now, fire me.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Stop it, Ryan.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Bingham, I’m here today to inform you that your position is
no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m fired?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yes, you’re fired.</p>
<p>****: Never say fired.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You’ve been let go.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: This is a mythical situation. How could I
possibly know why?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You never know why. Why doesn’t matter.
32.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s important not to focus on the “why”
and rather to spend your energy thinking about your future.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m going to spend my energy on suing you if
you don’t give me a reason that you’re firing me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Bingham, the reason is not
important.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, so you’re firing me without grounds.</p>
<p>****: Now, I really have a lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Ryan, I think we know what you’re
trying to say…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Don’t take this personally,
Mr. Bingham.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Personally? This is the most personal
situation you will ever enter. So before you try to revolutionize my
business, I’d like to know that you actually know my business.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the
team. 33.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Am I the only one who sees that by automating
our own business, we’re making ourselves irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: No… We’re making you irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Hey, don’t blame me. Blame fuel
costs. Blame insurance premiums. Blame technology.</p>
<p>****: Watch yourself, Ryan. You’re too young to be a dinosaur…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not… I’m not a dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I want you to show her the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do I know about what happens around here?
Have Ferguson do it.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I’m not talking about here.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Hey, you seem pretty confident that
this girl doesn’t know what she’s doing…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excuse me. I just don’t think a MySpace page
qualifies you to rewire an entire company.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Great. Well, here’s your chance. Show
her the magic. Take her through the paces.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not a fucking tour guide. 34.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: This is the boat.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: This is you.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Do you want to be in the boat?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yes. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Ryan, we’re ringing the bell.
Rounding everybody up. If you want to stay out there a little longer,
you can. But you’re not going to be on your own. Let me know.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 35.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I really like my luggage.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s exactly what it is. Luggage. You know
how much time you lose by checking in?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t know, maybe five minutes waiting
for… 36.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two
hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours…
That’s Seven Days. You ready to throw away a whole week on that?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Bingo. Asians.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Never get behind people travelling with
infants. I’ve never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Old people are worse. Their bodies are
littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little
time they have left on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Five words. Randomly selected for additional
screening.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Asians. They’re light packers, treasure
efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love’em.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That’s racist.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m like my mother. I stereotype. It’s
faster.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are you upset at your laptop?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Fats Domino had a lighter touch.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I type with purpose.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What are you working on so furiously?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I’m building a work flow of firing
techniques. Questions &amp; responses. Actions &amp; reactions. A script
that works kind of like a tributary, taking you through the steps of
firing someone.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Who is it for? 38.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Theoretically, you could put it in the
hands of anybody and they could be downsizing immediately. All they have
to do is follow the steps.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Natalie, what is it, you think we do here?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: We prepare the newly unemployed for the
emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting while… Minimizing
potential legal blowback?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s what we’re selling. But it’s not what
we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Okay, what are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry
wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at
which hope’s bright shore is dimly visible…</p>
<p>****: And then to stop the boat, shove’em in the water, and make them
swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the
employers with our bills.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That was really impressive. You rehearse
that?</p>
<p>****: I got to grab this. I’ll meet you at the rental lot. 39.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, I was hoping I’d hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m in Hotlanta. I need a rib joint recommend
bad.</p>
<p>****: Fat Matt’s. Bring a bib.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You haven’t called.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You know, I didn’t know what was
appropriate…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ryan, I’m not some waitress you banged in a
snow storm. The word “Appropriate” has no place in our collective
vocabulary. I’m the woman you don’t have to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This sounds like a trick.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Next time you’re worried about manners -
Don’t. If you want to call - Call. Just think of me as yourself… only
with a vagina.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: When am I going to see you? 40.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m out of Hartsfield, into IAD, then a
connection at ORD into SDF.</p>
<p>****: Oh… sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How long is your layover in O’Hare? They’ve
got multiples into SDF… Think you could push?</p>
<p>****: I can push.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Ryan Bingham, from CTC.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: All you have to do today is watch and listen.
When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You ever find it strange that termination
comes with a packet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Everything important in life comes with a
packet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thank you for coming by. As you’re probably
well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not
immune.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: While I wish I was here with better news, the
reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment
here.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is not a time to look for blame. Your
position simply no longer exists.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I understand why you are saying these
things.</p>
<p>****: 42.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s perfectly natural to feel this way. I
want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Fill out the skill set work sheet… Use the
hopes and dreams diagram… And the tree of aspirations.</p>
<p>****: The answers are all in there.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The answers are all in there.</p>
<p>****: The answers…</p>
<p>****: The answers…</p>
<p>****: … are-all-in-there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And what do you suggest I tell them?</p>
<p>****: Perhaps you’re underestimating the positive effect your career
transition may have on your children.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Positive effect? 43.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Well, tests have shown that children under
moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a
method of coping.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Go fuck yourself. That’s what my kids’ll
think.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Your children’s admiration is important to
you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah. It was.</p>
<p>****: Well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey asshole, aren’t you here to console me?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not a shrink, Bob. I’m a wake up call. You
know why kids love athletes?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Because they screw lingerie models.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, that’s why we love athletes. Kids love
them because they follow their dreams.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, well I can’t dunk.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: But you can cook.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What are you talking about? 44.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Your resume says you minored in French
Culinary Arts. Most students work the frier at KFC. You bussed tables at
Il Picatorre to support yourself. Then you got out of college and
started working here. How much did they first pay you to give up on your
dreams?</p>
<p>****: Twenty seven thousand a year.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: At what point were you going to stop and go
back to what made you happy?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Do you believe in fate, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fate?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways in which
we wind up doing the things we were meant to do.</p>
<p>****: I met my wife at a gas station.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Exactly. Well, I think fate is telling you to
do something, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I see guys who work for the same company their
entire lives. Clock in. Clock out. Never a moment of happiness. Not
everyone gets this kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>****: 45.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The chance for rebirth. If not for yourself…
Do it for your kids.</p>
<p><strong>business woman</strong>: I’ve been waiting ten minutes. He
just waltzes in and gets to cut in line.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We reserve priority assistance for our
Hilton Honors members.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You should look into it - The promotions are
great…</p>
<p><strong>business woman</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hungry, much?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Our expense account allots for forty dollars
each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile
business. What’s that all about? Are you talking like frequent flier
miles?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Your really want to know?</p>
<p>****: I’m dying to know.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t spend a nickel, if I can help it,
unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I’m not talking hotel
rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music
downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles
they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value. 47.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: So, what are you saving up for? Hawaii?
South of France?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, it’s not like that… The miles are the
goal.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That’s it? You’re saving to save?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Let’s just say I’ve got a number in mind and
haven’t hit it yet.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Wow. Seems a little abstract. What’s your
target?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’d rather not.</p>
<p>****: It’s a secret target?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s ten million miles.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Huh. Isn’t ten million just a number?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Pi is just a number.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I guess we all need a hobby.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh hey, I didn’t mean to belittle your
collection. I get it. Sounds cool.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’d be the seventh person to do it. More
people have walked on the moon.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Do they give you a parade or something?
48.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet
the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And… They put your name on the side of a
plane.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Men get such a hard-on from putting their
name on stuff… You guys don’t grow up - You just need to pee on
everything.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Now, who’s stereotyping?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fear of mortality. It’s like Yes, you’re
going to die one day.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And why do you suppose that’s singular to
men?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Probably cause you can’t have babies.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: If I had that many miles, I’d just show up
at the airport, look up at one of those big destination boards, pick a
place and go.</p>
<p><strong>intercut with:</strong>: 49.</p>
<p>****: Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Man alive.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Left, left, left, left… one more inch… and
stop.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: My sister is cooky. She thinks this is
charming… Like the gnome thing. 50.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, I mean… why would your sister want a
fake photo in front of the St. Louis Airport?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She should be so lucky to visit Lambert Field.
The Wright Brothers flew through there…</p>
<p>****: The domed main terminal was the first of its kind. A precursor
to everything from JFK to DeGualle.</p>
<p>****: Wow. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why she wants dozens of reminders of all the
places she hasn’t been is beyond me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Well, I’m sure she’s going to be crushed
for having missed this airport.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look - Before Lindbergh could cross the
Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways… Ever wondered why they
call it the Spirit of St. Louis?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>young asian guy</strong>: … And another thing…? You know how
fucked this place is without me? You know how fucked this place is
without me? Fucked in the ass, man.</p>
<p>****: 51.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sometimes, they just need to vent.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Please, for the love of God, can I fire the
next one?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m here to be fired, right?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: We’re here to talk about your future.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t have to sugar coat it. I get the
drill. What are they offering?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Inside the packet you’ll find a clearly
worked out severance package.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Give me the bullet points.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Three months pay. Six months medical. A
full year of placement services through our company, CTC.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Placement services? How generous. 52.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Commonly, it takes one month of searching
for every ten thousand dollars you expect to earn in salary.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So I could be looking for a while.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Not necessarily…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, don’t sweat it. I’m pretty confident
about my plans.</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide in the
morning or the evening?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t know. Why?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s this beautiful bridge by my
apartment. I need to figure out what time to jump off it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: People say these things all the time. It comes
with the trade.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: They do?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff.
They get worked up.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: She was so calm. 53.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I think that’s a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: So they don’t actually ever do it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No… it’s just talk.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How do you know? Do you follow up?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but
I don’t think you should worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is the job. Taking people at their most
fragile moment and setting them adrift.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I’ll be back soon. Not really sure how long
this whole exercise is supposed to last. He’s fine… It’s hard for these
guys to accept change, you know. I… I’m not even going to answer that…
No, I can’t even think of him that way… He’s old.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay. This is where it gets a little
difficult, but stay with me. You have a new backpack… but this time, I
want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, people
around the office, friends of friends and work your way to the people
you trust with your most intimate secrets. Now move into family members
- cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get your sisters and your brothers and you
parents. Get them all in that backpack. And finally your husband or wife
or boyfriend or girlfriend. Get them in their too. 55.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m not going to ask you to light
it on fire.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake,
your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. Feel the
straps cutting into your shoulders. All those negotiations and arguments
and secrets and compromises.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Now set that bag down.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You don’t need to carry all that weight.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Some animals were meant to carry each other.
To live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star-crossed lovers. Monogamous
swans. We are not one of those animals.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The slower we move, the faster we die. We are
not swans. We’re sharks.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Never…?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You never want to get married? Never want
kids?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Is that so bizarre?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t see the value.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sell it to me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sell me marriage.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I… Uh… How how about love?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Pff… 57.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Okay. Stability?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How many stabile marriages do you know?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Someone to talk to, spend your life
with?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt
that will change.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How about just not dying alone?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one
of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same
way.</p>
<p>****: Make no mistake. We all die alone.</p>
<p>****: Those cult members down in San Diego with the white sneakers
and little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They didn’t die alone.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just saying - There’s options.</p>
<p>****: Oh fuck. 58.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Brian left me.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, hey… I…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my…
friend, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I should give you both a moment.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, it’s fine. I’m fine. Just stupid
emotions.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Maybe a drink?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Now we’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>text reads</strong>: “I Think it’s time we c other
people”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He broke up with you over text message?</p>
<p>****: That’s kind of like firing people over the internet.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What a weasely prick.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yeah, but what does that make me? Someone
who falls for a prick?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We all fall for them. Pricks are spontaneous,
unpredictable, and fun. And then we’re surprised when they turn out to
be pricks.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I followed him to Omaha.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I had a job waiting for me in San Fran,
when he got an offer from ConAgra. He told me we could start a life
together. So I followed him.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: To Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I look in the mirror and I just see
compromise… I’m supposed to do something.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’ll do plenty.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I just can’t… I thought I’d be engaged by
now.</p>
<p>****: No offense. 60.</p>
<p><strong>alex ryan</strong>: It’s alright. None taken.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: When I was sixteen, I thought by twenty
three, I would be married, maybe have a kid… Corner office by day,
entertaining at night. I was supposed to be driving a Grand Cherokee by
now.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Life can underwhelm you that way.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Now I have my sights on twenty nine,
because thirty is just way too… apocalyptic. I mean, where did you think
you’d be by…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: At a certain point, you stop with the
deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: They can be a little counterproductive.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t want to say anything that’s…
anti-feminist. I mean, I really appreciate everything your generation
did for me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: But sometimes it feels like no matter how
much success I have, it all won’t matter until I find the right guy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You really thought this guy was the one.
61.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yeah, I guess. I don’t know. I could have
made it work. He just really fit the bill.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The bill?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: My type. You know, white collar. College
grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny movies. Six foot one. Brown hair. Kind
eyes. Works in finance but is Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends. I
always imagined he’d have a single syllable name like Matt or John or…
Dave. In a perfect world, he drives a Four Runner and the only thing he
loves more than me is his golden lab. Oh… and a nice smile. How about
you?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not sure if…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I meant Alex…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Huh, let me think for a sec. Well, by the time
you’re thirty four, all the physical requirements are pretty much out
the window. I mean you secretly prey he’ll be taller than you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Not an asshole would be nice? Just someone who
enjoys my company. Comes from a good family - You don’t think about that
when you’re younger.</p>
<p>****: Wants kids… Likes kids…</p>
<p>****: 62.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Wants kids. Healthy enough to play catch with
his future son one day.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Please let him earn more than I do. That
doesn’t make sense now, but believe me, it will one day. Otherwise it’s
just a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>****: Hopefully some hair on his head…? But it’s not exactly a
deal-breaker anymore. Nice smile… Yep, a nice smile just might do
it.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Wow. That was depressing.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I should just date lesbians.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tried it. We’re no picnic ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t mind being married to my career,
and I don’t expect it to hold me in bed as I fall asleep.</p>
<p>****: I just don’t want to settle.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re young. Right now you see settling as
some sort of failure.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It is. By definition.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t worry, by the time someone is right for
you, it won’t feel like settling… And the only person left to judge you
will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back.
63.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: So, what’s the plan for this evening?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What…? Oh, is it illicit?</p>
<p>****: No…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s nothing like that.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: We are in Miami.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … We were going to hit that party for the tech
conference in the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I didn’t know you could just attend
those…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, I mean…</p>
<p>****: You’re going to crash it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan alex</strong>: I mean, I don’t know if… More money than
they know These guy put on a quite a what to do with… party…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, I get it. I’m in! 64.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Jennifer Chu?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s going to be fine.</p>
<p>****: You okay there?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh yeah… This was a great idea.</p>
<p>****: You are so pretty. You’re exactly what I want to look like in
fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>conference leader</strong>: How’s everyone doing out
there?!</p>
<p><strong>conference leader</strong>: I’m going to need you to all put
your hands together for a very special guest - YOUNG… M… C!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Think she’ll be okay?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Back home, I don’t get to act the way I do
with you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s why I don’t have a “back home”.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know. You’re so cool. “Mr. Empty Back
Pack”.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You know about the back pack?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I googled you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You did? 66.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s what us modern girls do when we have a
crush.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Did it bother you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, that depends. Is the bag empty because
you hate people or just the baggage they bring along?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t hate people. I’m not exactly a
hermit.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You just don’t want to be tied down? The whole
responsibility thing.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t think it’s even that… I… First time I
ever flew, I was sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re not going to answer? You’re just going
to tell me a story?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It was January and I had just gotten my
driver’s license. The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car
and hit the ice to do donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit a soft spot
and the hood of my car tilted up and I was sinking backwards into the
water.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I literally started to drown. Within a few
seconds, I black out. Then, I wake up in the sky. I’m in a helicopter,
laying on a stretcher. This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes
away from dying.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh my God. 67.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Right? So just as we’re hovering over the
hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western
horizon. We’d been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city
I’d thought of as remote, halfway across the state… a foreign
capital.</p>
<p>****: My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth,
but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing
didn’t make much sense. And I remember thinking - Don’t tell me this
isn’t an age of miracles. Don’t tell me we can’t be everywhere at
once.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t know what originally sparked the back
pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I’ve been thinking that
maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in.</p>
<p><strong>software dude</strong>: Hey… I think we’re out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, you’re up…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in
Milwaukee.</p>
<p>****: Oh… Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, all right… Just leave the money on the
dresser.</p>
<p>****: I’ll text you later so we can swap schedules.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed
spending time with someone as much as you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Neither can I.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Last night got a little out of hand. I said
things… I don’t remember everything I said. I just didn’t want you to
think…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose.
So, did you wake him up or slip out?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This morning… Your new friend. Did you wake
him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a
whore.</p>
<p>****: I… just left.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Protocol is always tricky.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I didn’t know what was right.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sometimes there really is no right thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What happened to Alex?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Had to skip town early to make a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That’s too bad. Where does she live?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You thinking of going to see her?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t know. We just don’t have that kind of
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What kind of relationship do you have?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s, you know. Casual.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Sounds pretty special.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It works for us.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Think there’s any future there?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Never thought about it. What’s going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Really never thought about it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How can you not think about these things?
How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a
future with somebody? 71.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s simple, you know that moment when you
look into someone’s eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul,
and the whole world goes quiet for a second.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Right. Well, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh come on, I’m just dicking around. I need
your help…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Don’t you think it’s worth giving her a
chance?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: A chance to what?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: A chance at something real?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Natalie, your definition of “real” is going to
evolve as you get older…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Would you stop condescending for one
second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit
philosophy?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Bullshit philosophy?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: The isolation? The traveling? Is that
supposed to be charming?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, it’s simply a life choice. 72.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s a cocoon of self-banishment.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Wow. Big words.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well, screw you too.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You’ve set up a way of life that basically
makes it impossible for you to make any human connections. Now, somehow,
this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous “life choice” and comes
out the other end with a smile - Just so you can call her casual. Jesus.
I need to grow up? You’re a twelve year old.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t have a gauntlet of…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: These Detroit guys can be tough. They’ve been
getting hammered. Don’t get distracted. Stick to the simple stuff. Get
the packet in their hands and get them out the door.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Welcome to Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What’s going on here? 74.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I’ve been getting those great numbers
over the last few days. Thought we should nut up and give this a
try.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We could use a little more time.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Gotta leave the nest at some
point.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is a real company, Craig. We’re here to
do some damage.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I know. Good thing we brought our
best. So let’s stop screwing around, alright?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just give me a minute to prepare and get my
things together.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I was thinking Natalie takes this
one.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She’s hardly ready for this.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I’ve been watching her. She’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is a whole other animal…</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: I mean, she created it. Natalie, you
not up for it?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I’m… I’m game.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Atta girl. 75.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just remember, don’t apologize. Don’t tell
them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will
ever have. What we feel doesn’t even compare.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just keep it professional. You’re going to do
fine.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is Natalie
Keener.</p>
<p><strong>samuels</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I wish I was here with better news, however
your position here at Deckers is no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>samuels</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You’ve been let go. 76.</p>
<p><strong>samuels</strong>: What, just like that? I can’t believe… Who
are you?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: My name is Miss Keener. I am here to tell
you about your options…</p>
<p><strong>samuels</strong>: I work here for seventeen years and they
send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s perfectly normal to be upset. However,
the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities
waiting for you…</p>
<p><strong>samuels</strong>: Greater opportunities? I’m fifty-
seven-fucking years old!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Anybody who ever built an empire, or
changed the world, sat where you are now. And it’s because they sat
there that they were able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: There’s a packet in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I want you to take some time and review
it.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: All the answers you’re looking for are
inside those pages.</p>
<p>****: 77.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: The sooner you trust the process, the
sooner your next step in life will unveil itself.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I need you to return to your office now and
begin to put together your personal things.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Samuels? There’s nothing else we can
discuss now.</p>
<p>****: Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Mr. Samuels… Mr. Samuels…. MR.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You did good.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You okay? Want me to take over.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … We just got out here. That was one place. I
think we need to try a few more…</p>
<p>****: Maybe there isn’t a difference, but it’s comforting to know
we’re in the next room.</p>
<p>****: I know you don’t give a shit about my comfort.</p>
<p>****: We could just use a little more time. That’s all I’m
saying.</p>
<p>****: Right… Right. Yeah… Alright… Uh huh. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He thought you did a great job. You did - I
was real proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We’re being pulled off the road.</p>
<p>****: We’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: For good?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>wedding invitation.</strong>: 79.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I’m sorry about what I said about Alex. I
was out of line.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s alright. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I mean, who am I to be dolling out
relationship advice?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: In Omaha?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s better than you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Ryan, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Grabbing another flight… Something I need to
take care of. I’ll see you in, uh… at home.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay, start walking it in from the left.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you
in Vegas… I thought we’d gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi,
maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There’ll be plenty of time for all that. One
more foot to the left.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How do you feel about the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m fine, I guess. Okay great… walk away.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: They’re a cute couple.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Think so?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, they’ll make cute kids. If they’re
lucky, maybe look a little like you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How do you like Wisconsin in February?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p>****: 81.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I like it if you’re there. Besides, I know a
killer burger in Milwaukee.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Northern Wisconsin.</p>
<p>****: What are you doing this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What? I haven’t even…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m being serious.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You want me to be your date?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: To a wedding… Jesus, Ryan. Your sister’s
wedding?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s not like I know her that well.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m just not sure if it’s appropriate for me
to…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look. You know. I’m not the wedding type. But
for the first time in my life… I don’t want to be that guy, alone with
his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can
stomach it, I’d like it to be you. 82.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, I can’t believe I… Yeah, I’m in. When is
it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I feel like we should kiss or something.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Then kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are you available? 83.</p>
<p><strong>check-in lady</strong>: Sorry, this line is for members of
our Matterhorn program.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Kara…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Alex, this is my sister Kara.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Well, hello.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Ryan has told me nothing about you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn’t have to… Yeah,
uh, Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You’re not staying at the house?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: There was an extra room on hold here, so I
just took it for the weekend. 84.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yup. So, you guys are dating?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Hey, don’t worry about it. We’re all getting a
little old to be calling someone girlfriend… I remember when mom used to
call Jack her boyfriend. It drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for
kids…</p>
<p>****: And I’m just a divorcee!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: So, the rehearsal dinner?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yeah, I’ll see you two there.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There’s a packet.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What in life is worth doing that doesn’t have
a packet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Um, I love you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh my God, Ryan!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You must be Alex. You are so beautiful. Kara
was right. Did you get the basket?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The basket was very lovely.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Tammy wrapped all of them.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ryan, you look so grown up.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Me? You’re the one getting married.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know, right? You haven’t even seen my
ring.</p>
<p>****: Jim designed it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I brought those photos you were asking for…
86.</p>
<p>****: Oh great! They go over there.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: There were quite a few already up there.
Almost couldn’t find room.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know, isn’t it great how everyone chipped
in?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What gave you the idea to do something so…</p>
<p>****: … Substantial?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested
in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our
finances, a honeymoon just didn’t seem affordable this second… So I
thought… Hey, just because we can’t travel doesn’t mean we can’t have
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 87.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s sixty acres up against the foothills. I
subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sounds nice.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Homes will go in the high fours.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Must be a nice development.</p>
<p>****: It’s a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key
everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We’ll whack
your weeds, we’ll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your
own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We all need a place to call our own. This is
America. This is what we were promised.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s a nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That bit at the end about promise… I like it.
88.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>****: So, you still renting that one- bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I gave it up.</p>
<p>****: You own now?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you’re looking?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Not really. No.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Can you believe it’s tomorrow?! How are you
going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: You want some Xanax?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t think that’s for sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, I’m good. I’ll have some warm milk. That
should do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: One more box… 89.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jim seems like a good guy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah, I know… Isn’t he great?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: He’s going to make a great husband.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, Julie, I was thinking… with dad not
being… Well, I didn’t know if you had someone to walk you down the
aisle…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, yeah, Jim’s uncle is going to do it.</p>
<p>****: He’s been really supportive.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh… Oh, great. Just wanted to make sure you
were covered. So I should get there at…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Guests are arriving around 5ish. Things get
going at 530. So you know, around then. It’s easy. Just come down the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey Kara?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Can you believe she’s getting married already?
She’s just a kid.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: No Ryan. Actually, she’s 37 years old. She’s
barely squeaking by.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Yup. Sleep tight.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s all you got?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are we really doing this?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Give me a boost. 91.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I took geography in here.</p>
<p>****: That was my seat.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You ever fool around with one of your
teachers?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No. You?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Not until college. Come on, show me
around.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You played basketball?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Point guard. Don’t act so surprised.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I didn’t know you were such a jock.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: My first fight. 92.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Got my ass kicked.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is where we used to go to make out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Very romantic.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m really happy I came here.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Go Cougars!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s Kara.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Ryan, where are you? We’re having a meltdown
here.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What’s wrong? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: It’s Jim. Can you get back here? We need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, of course…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ll grab your suit.</p>
<p>****: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Jim’s got cold feet.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Today?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: That’s how cold feet work.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You want me to talk to him? 94.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Hey, it’s either you or me. You know my
record. I’ve already struck out once.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I haven’t been to bat. I haven’t been in the
dugout.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Don’t you talk for a living? Motivational type
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I tell people how to avoid commitment.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: What kind of fucked up message is that?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s a philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, it might have helped you.</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Come on, Ryan. You haven’t been around much.
Fuck, you basically don’t exist to us. I know you want to be there for
her… Well here it is. This is your chance.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, hey Jim. 95.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You ever read this?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, it’s pretty powerful stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Kara mentioned you were having some…
thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t think I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay. What makes you say that today?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I was just laying there last night in bed and I
couldn’t sleep. I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and
all. Us buying a house and moving in together. Having a kid… Having
another kid… … Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, football games,
all of a sudden they’re out of school, getting jobs, getting married,
And then, you know… I’m a grandparent. I’m retired. Before you know it -
I’m dead… and I just kept thinking… “What’s the point?”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I mean what is the point?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The point?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?</p>
<p>****: It’s marriage… it’s the most beautiful thing on Earth… you
know, what everyone aspires to… 96.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You never got married.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s true…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You never even tried.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well, it’s hard to define “try”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You seem happier than most of my married
friends.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jim, I’m not going to lie. Marriage can be a
pain in the ass. And you’re kind of right - All of this is just stuff on
the way to your eventual demise.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We are all on running clocks that cannot be
slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys
leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and
me… But some. But even those footprints disappear.</p>
<p>****: There isn’t a “point”.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not the guy you’d normally want to talk to
about all this stuff… But think about it - your favorite memories. The
greatest moments of your life? Were you alone? 97.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No… I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t want to sound like a Hallmark card,
but… Life? It’s better with company.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Come to think of it… Last night, the night
before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head…
Weren’t you two sleeping in separate rooms?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I
was all alone in that big honeymoon suite…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Kind of lonely?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s a nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s the mood like out there?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s not good… Emotional.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Go get her. 98.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m sorry I’m such a fuck up… Will you be my
co-pilot?</p>
<p><strong>kara</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hi, I’m Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>wedding guest</strong>: I’m your cousin… Harold.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, hey!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: When am I going to see you?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You’re just going to have to come and
visit.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: So settled down. You’re not going to change on
me…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Same guy. Just one address.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Call me if you get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: … I’m lonely.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: … Some guy sits down in a conference room
somewhere and a server routes their session to one of our termination
engineers.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You don’t actually call them that.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I prefer “terminators”, but it bumped with
legal.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Really? I can’t imagine why.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: They follow a workflow that can take them
through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are they actually on line, right now?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, they’re beta-testing. Role-playing. We
go live at the end of the month. Kyle, you’re running through the events
too quickly. You have to give them time to acknowledge each statement.
Okay? It’s a legal thing.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is ridiculous. 101.</p>
<p><strong>goalquest host</strong>: You ready to rock?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand
miles. The moon is only two fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Imagine for a second that you’re carrying a
backpack… I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders… You feel
them?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff
you have in your life. Start with the little things.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The… um… The stuff in drawers and on
shelves.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>****: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p>****: Okay, everyone just relax. We’ll have your next guest out in a
sec.</p>
<p><strong>rental car assistant</strong>: Hey, you forgot to give me
your Devotion Club card!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Honey, who’s at the door?</p>
<p>****: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>alex’s husband</strong>: Who was that? 104.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: … just some guy who was lost.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How could you lie to me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What were you thinking - Just showing up at my
door like that?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I
didn’t know you had a family - Why didn’t you tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come on, I thought we signed up for the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Try to help me understand. What is it you
signed up for?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I thought our relationship was perfectly
clear. You’re…</p>
<p>****: 105.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: … an escape.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m an escape?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You know, a break from our normal lives… A
parenthesis.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m a parenthesis?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Seriously, Ryan? I can’t believe we’re having
this conversation. I mean what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You don’t even know what you want. I’m sorry
that I ruined your night… But you could have seriously screwed things up
for me. That was my family. That’s my real life.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I thought I was a part of your real life.</p>
<p>****: Look, Ryan. I’m a grown up. I don’t hold a grudge. When you’re
ready to be an adult and see me again, just give me a call.</p>
<p><strong>plucky ticket agent</strong>: Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
106.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?</p>
<p><strong>plucky ticket agent</strong>: Of course. Left side aisle,
non- bulkhead. Just like you like it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What’s got you so fucking happy?</p>
<p><strong>plucky ticket agent</strong>: Your boarding card,
Mr. Bingham.</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special
announcement to make.</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: Our pilot has just informed me that we are
passing over the city of Mesa… which might not mean much to most of you,
but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p>****: That seat taken? 107.</p>
<p><strong>maynard finch</strong>: You’re the youngest yet to hit twenty
mil. Don’t know where you found the time…</p>
<p>****: Oh right, here you go.</p>
<p><strong>maynard finch</strong>: Seventh card we’ve made. Small club.
We really appreciate your loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You know how many times I’ve thought about
this moment? Played out the conversation I’d have with you right
here.</p>
<p><strong>maynard finch</strong>: Really? What did you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You know, I… I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>maynard finch</strong>: That’s alright. Happens to all of us.
So, where you from?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m from here.</p>
<p><strong>airline operator</strong>: Hello, Mr. Bingham. 108.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, how did you know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>airline operator</strong>: This is your dedicated line. We
reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh. I’d like to transfer some of my miles. Can
you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller?</p>
<p><strong>airline operator</strong>: Certainly. How many miles would
you like to transfer?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How many miles would it take to circle the
globe?</p>
<p><strong>airport operator</strong>: We have our “around-the-world”
tickets. They’re five hundred thousand miles each.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sounds perfect.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Got a second?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m going to have to call you right back.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: What happened to you yesterday? I was
trying to reach you all day.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I got tied up in… personal stuff. What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Do you remember Karen Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: She was part of a thirty person
reduction a few weeks back in Wichita. Natalie fired her.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, I fire dozens of people a day.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: She killed herself. Jumped off a
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p>****: Do you remember anyone giving you any signals of anything?
Depression?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: They’re all depressed. We’re firing them.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Hey, look, you know I have to
ask.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, I don’t remember anything. Of course
they’re upset. You never think that…</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Wasn’t any woman who gave you any
indication…? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, nothing that stands out.</p>
<p>****: Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Natalie quit.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Text message. 110.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No
one has manners anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She say where she was going?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Nah. She was pretty upset.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I should give her a call.</p>
<p>****: I need you back in the air.</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: Did you hear me? I thought you’d be
thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m fine. What about video conferencing?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: CTC is pausing on the whole new media
front for a moment. Giving it a little more thought. Getting our work
horses back out doing what they do best.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How long are you sending me out?</p>
<p><strong>craig gregory</strong>: We’re going to let you sail and sail.
Send us a postcard if you ever get there.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: So, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How exactly do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You graduated top of your class. You seemed
to have your pick of employment… Including right here. Instead, you went
to Omaha… to fire people for a living.</p>
<p>****: It’s challenging work.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I can’t imagine doing that day-in- day-out.
Not in this climate.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: … I followed a boy.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Everybody does at one point or another.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This guy says I’d be lucky to have you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: To whom it may concern, I can’t even count the
number of people I’ve fired in my lifetime. So many, that I’ve forgotten
what it’s like to actually hire somebody. We’ve never met, but I know
you’d be lucky to have Natalie Keener. My advice? Take her and don’t
look back. She’ll be the best decision you’ve made in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>int. office, san francisco - day</strong>: 112.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hope he’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Tonight, most people will be welcomed home by
jumping dogs and squealing kids. Their spouses will ask about their day
and tonight they’ll sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The stars will wheel forth from their daytime
hiding places.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And one of those lights, slightly brighter
than the rest, will be my wingtip, passing over, blessing them.</p>
