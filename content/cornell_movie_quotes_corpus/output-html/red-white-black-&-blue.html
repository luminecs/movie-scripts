<h1 id="red-white-black--blue">red-white-black-&amp;-blue</h1>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You should hit the bricks.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful woman</strong>: Don’t I even get breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>drunkard</strong>: Right on, Brown Sugar! How ’bout taking me
with you?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Where I’m going today, Old Man, you do not
want to go.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Look at her and him together. King Kong and
Fay Wray.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Why do I always have to sit in back?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: It’s just the way things are, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Well, I would like to sit in front
today.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: It’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Fer cryin’ out loud, Billy-Boy, just get in
the car. You’re way too big a target to be sitting up here.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: How’s your precious little school-marm
today?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: She’s fine, as if you cared.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Tell me something… what’s a school teacher
doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of
downtown skank-ville? I mean, this is not the place for fine dining,
unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What
are you saying, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She’s
really something special. You’re a lucky fella.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Lay off once, would you?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: It’s the way you say it, like there’s
something more too it.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Wha… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Birth control’s important.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What… what kinda thing is that to
say?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: She’s right. If you two are doing the
horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound
bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you
“daddy.”</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Jeez… it’s too early in the morning for
this. Leave off. Here’s your paper.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What, am I supposed to read it while I
drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You know, the more weight back there, the
faster the car goes.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws
of physics. The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I’m back here, aren’t I? So, you don’t
have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Oh… okay.</p>
<p><strong>porn dealer</strong>: Hey, hey, hey, Kittle… I don’t need no
fucking hassle here!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Then, sit your fat, sweaty ass back down in
that chair!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Pardon me… my mistake. Taking your thoughts
in hand, huh… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Whoops… don’t mind me. Go ahead and finish
up.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Sir, the management would like to offer a
complimentary wet-nap…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hey, Benny! How’s it hanging? Well… you
know, don’t answer that.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Kittle…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We’ve
been looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You remember Nena and Billy-Boy. Take a
break, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What do you want? I’m clean. I been clean a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Really? Is that a fact… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Pure horse.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You are such a disappointment, Benny.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh, you fuckers! You fucking fuckers! What?
What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Word is, while the vice cops on the East
Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got
smuggled into New York City. And, right now it’s making a cross-country
journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Arriving tonight</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Going into Zimmermann’s pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Look, I know how you guys operate, but I got
a witness… I got a witness, so you can’t squeeze me.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Looks like your dime ran out.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Hey now… what the fuck… ?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Know what he’s doing, Benny? He’s trying to
jog your memory.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about, man.
Even if I did, I’m not so crazy I’m gonna cross Zimmermann.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: This scag is enough to keep every junkie
from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.
You think we’re gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on
the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You must not think we take our
responsibilities very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy’s neck
broke… … just like that. Sad in a way. Why is it we don’t truly
appreciate our arms and legs till we’ve lost the use of them?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Alright! Alright… put me down…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: It’s bone dry out there. Everybody’s hurting.
The stuff floating around’s been cut so many times it’s like powdered
sugar, but Zimnermann’s gonna fix it.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I need the “when” and the “where.”</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I don’t know, okay? All I know is Butch
Cassidy’s back in town.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: That’s not what we heard.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: He’s back, swear to friggin’ God. I seen him
at the needle farm saying how he’s Zimmermann’s number one candy-man
again. If anyone knows anything, he does.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Airight… we’ll take that. But, start
spreading the news… Zimmermann goes down tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What the fuck… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Come on, Butch… show your pretty face…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Just breathing the air in there’ll give you
the clap.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You shouldn’t litter.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Thank you, concerned citizen.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Give a Hoot. Don’t Pollute.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’ll give you a fucking hoot if you don’t
shut up back there.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Don’t torture yourself…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo
crap? Some fruitcake’s writing it between bong hits, making it up as he
goes, and you’re actually taking the time to read it.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Yeah, non-believer? Here’s yours… “Scorpio,
October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so
proceed with caution…”</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Look out! Jupiter and Saturn’ll get you
every fucking time.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: “Today you have a rare opportunity to make a
big difference in your chosen field. By your able leadership and with
great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a
winner.”</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Let me see that… Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What’s mine say?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: “Leo. The stages of the moon are in alignment,
so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.
Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as
your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails
inside your underwear.”</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: It doesn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: No, but it should.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hey, before I forget…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Just a little, you know… Bicentennial
memento. Nothing special.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Whoa, thanks, man. These are cool.
They’ll be collector’s items.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Yeah… great.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You know… you could say thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You’re the one with the star-spangled hard-on,
not me.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What are you, communist? At least numb-nuts
here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over
commemorative salt and pepper shakers</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I just think you should show some respect. I
mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and
those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they
did that so we could all share in the freedom…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: First of all, the Constitution wasn’t writtem
till 1787…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Second of all, the Declaration of Independence
was all for liberty and equality, but it didn’t do anything about
slavery, did it?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Yeah, well… nobody’s perfect. They couldn’t
go doing everything at once.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: All I’m saying is, your little Bicentennial
mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper
shaker so the pepper couldn’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>kittie</strong>: Let’s drop it, alright?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: That’s him alright.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: It’s go time, Billy-B.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Escort everyone’s favorite She-Male over
here nice and peaceful-like. Let’s not have another incident like at the
laundromat. I’ll never forget the look on that poor woman’s face.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: That wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Save it. Just go.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t let him get to the van.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t let him get to the van.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t let him get to the fucking van!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Smooth move, hot-shot.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Lose some weight.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I… I can’t find my seatbelt.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What do you want me to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We got him.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: “Go, go, go!” “Slow down.” Make up your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Don’t crowd him.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Down!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Hate to say I told you so.</p>
<p><strong>butch cassidy</strong>: What the fuck you doin’? They’re
pigs! You can’t kill no cops!</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Sons of bitches!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: We catch ’em, I wanna be first to hurt
’em. Promise me I get to go first.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We’ll share.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch
Cassidy alive, remember?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Shit. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: If they crash, maybe he’ll run. You can
shoot him in the leg or something.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Let’s hope.</p>
<p><strong>butch cassidy</strong>: You crazy fucking junkie!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Central, car 1-5-5 requests an ambulance
Uh… ambulance emergency at Canyon Boulevard and…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Um… we’re on Canyon where it’s really…
twisty, turny.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: That’s a federal offense right there;
tampering with the U.S mail!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m gonna get beside him.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: That’s a bad plan.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m gonna get beside. Nena, you’re gonna
shoot out his tires.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I can work this.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: No you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You… SUCK! You almost got us all killed!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You think this is so easy?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Can’t be worse than you.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: That’s right, white bread. Give it up. Right
now.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Okay, okay… hold on. Don’t go getting your
panties in a knot…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Make a hole, Billy-Boy.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I’d rather you guys didn’t do this
again.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Now we’re taking a ride.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Get closer! Don’t lose him!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I kinda already figured that, but keep those
helpful hints coming.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You put your bumper just behind his left
tire and then accelerate… make him spin out…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more
than the sound of your own voice?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: This is too fast. This is <U>way</U> too
fast!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: We should slow down.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your
eyes if you’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Alright… you had your chance, sister. Make
room for Kittle…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: The time has come… … for asses to be
kicked.</p>
<p><strong>butch cassidy</strong>: Fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Firepower, Billy-Boy</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Jiminy Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I can not even begin to imagine how much
that must have hurt.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Halt, jackass!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Told you you’d get to shoot him. Think you
can pick him up without all the bells and whistles this time, Big-Boy?
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>joe mechanic</strong>: Ah, Jeez, here we go again…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Sorry, Joe. These things happen.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Pop in a windshield and bang out the dents.
I need it quick.</p>
<p><strong>joe mechanic</strong>: This car loves you, Kittle. Why do you
treat it so bad?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Fear of commitment.</p>
<p><strong>friend cop</strong>: Kittle!?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hey, squirt! Goddamn, it’s good to see you.
How you been?</p>
<p><strong>friend cop</strong>: Can’t complain, but I will if you give
me half a chance.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You met my partners… ? This here’s Harry
McDoogle’s kid. Fresh out of the academy. Top of the class and best
scores on the pistol range to boot.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Your pop must be proud of you. Look at ya,
ya short-shaver…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Finally got a haircut. Hell, you look almost
respectable.</p>
<p><strong>friend cop</strong>: Almost, right? Looks like you got your
hands full.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Buckaroo’s going downstairs for a little
“chit-chat.” Gonna tell us all about Zimmermann’s big score… Aren’t you,
Butch-Butch?</p>
<p><strong>butch cassidy</strong>: Suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: He’s disgruntled right now, but he’ll come
around.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: No… come on, kid. Come on… No…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Noooooooooooo…!!</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: Nice job, boys. Iced a bonus cop in the
bargain.</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: Groovey.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You’re excused.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Sirs and madam… I assure you you’re not
welcome here, This is a very exclusive, <U>private</U> club.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: So is this…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Well, well… if it isn’t the Justice
League of America.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t get up on our account. Mind if we join
you, Zimmermann?</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Be my guest. Ladies… go powder your
beaks.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: How you been, Poe?</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: Better than ever, chickie.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Still haven’t fixed those front choppers, huh?
Guess you’re digging that hillbilly look.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We probably should give ’em back… but
Billy-Boy seems to think they’re some kinda good luck charm.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: What can we do for you, officers? What
new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Just wanted to make you aware… before
today’s over, we’ll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and
pissing down on you.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Thank you for sharing that charming
image.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Laugh it up. You’ll cry later.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You’ll cry like a great big, blubbering
baby.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: You three… Narcotics have been around
since before 4000 B.C. Marijuana was a major crop in colonial North
America. Wars have been waged over opium, and still… in spite of it… …
into that timeline of thousands of years come three vice cops determined
to change the course of human history.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Couldn’t have said it better myself.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: You bust some small-time pimps, whores
and dime-bag junkies, like the world’s a better place because you’re in
it. And for what, Kittle… two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me,
how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay
their rent?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Just ’cause you belong to some fancy-pants
club, doesn’t make you any less a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Murderer? Really?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You’re stealing people’s lives, pusher-man.
You might be killin’ them so slow they think they’re being saved, but
down that road, they’re just as dead.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Live under whichever delusion you
choose, you’ll never touch me. You’re not smart enough.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Shove it up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: And always with the witty rejoinder.
Touche’! Let me treat you to brunch. You’ll need your strength.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Thanks, but we don’t recognize “brunch” as
an actual meal.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: I insist. What will it be? Boston Tea
Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No…
There’s a special on the menu, today only… … <U>roasted</U>
<U>pig</U>.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I could end a whole lotta suffering right
now.</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: And your friends’ lives.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Your poison’s not gonna make it into the
veins of any kids this time.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Wave that flag, hero. Keep dreaming
those dreams.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Something needs to be done about them,
once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>officer jim</strong>: Whoop-de-do, there they go. Strutting
in like they’re better than us.</p>
<p><strong>officer steve</strong>: They’re a disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>officer jim</strong>: It’s their kind of… of… overzealous
antics that give cops a bad name.</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: Hey, big man… how’s the last of the
red hot lovers?</p>
<p><strong>homicide cop</strong>: That girlie of yours… she’s
one-in-a-million, I’ll tell you. How you lucked into that, I’ll never
know. You must be one gifted cocksman.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I don’t… what… !??</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: My office! Now!</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: I turned on my t.v., and I expected to
see Los Angeles brimming with jubilation. I expected children with
painted faces. Men and women in Bicentennial garb. Multi-ethnic marching
bands. Pie eating contests. All good things American. I turned on my
t.v., and what did I see instead? A corpse was scraped off Canyon Road
after Lord knows how many cars ran over the carcass. And in a related
story, a high speed chase ended when the suspect was thrown from the
highway to his death.</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: And, what… what am I forgetting? Oh,
yes… the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting
through the front doors of the precinct house!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well, sir…</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: No. Don’t open your mouth! You
<U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I… I think I can… clarify…</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: Don’t bother. This behavior’s gone on
too long. You’re suspended.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: You heard the man…</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: It’s noon straight up. Effective
immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We’ve been chasing this deal six months, and
now you’re gonna chuck it out the window?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hey now, look! Let’s all get on the same
page here. This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann’s syndicate; all or
nothing. If we stop the drugs, we don’t even have to catch him
red-handed. He’s ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.
On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling
the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn’t have a single empty
drawer. More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry
needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann’s sitting back and laughing
his head off.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: There’ll be other chances.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Not like this. Are you even listening?</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: I will not allow your obsession to turn
a day of pride and celebration into a day of wholesale slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: May I say something… ?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t you condescend to tell me how or why
to honor Independence Day, and don’t tell me I’m overreacting when I’m
trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into
this city!</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: You’re about an inch away from
insubordination!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well… seeing how you just suspended me,
what’s to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: Till the last firework fizzles out
tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I’ll decide if you
keep your shield.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I say, fuck ’em. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Well… we shouldn’t rush into this, right?
Let’s talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What are you, Henry friggin’ Kissinger all
the sudden?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I’m just saying…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You’re just saying nothing! Tonight is the
night.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Yeah, but if we don’t sit, they’ll take
our badges.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What of it? Haven’t we waited forever… ?
Haven’t we, honey? Haven’t we waited long enough to get this
scumbag?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What… ? Not you too?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: He’s right. We hit the bricks, we walk back
triple-fucked.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I can’t believe I’m hearing this,</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle, It’s
the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out
there.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I know it is, even if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: All I got is being a cop. What do I do if
I’m not that?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren’t for
me, you’d still be sitting in the file room where I found you. And you…
Nena… you’ve still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of. You
of all people…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that’s
how I wanna keep ’em. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Guys… all we’ve got is each other. Don’t we
know that by now?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Christ… Alright… alright, I’m taking off.
I’ll expect you to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Damn him.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Come on, come on… !</p>
<p><strong>theater owner</strong>: Hey, you fucking creep.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Get this straight, you jive-ass
cocksucker. Do a number on me and you are between a rock and a hard
place. Dig it, clown?</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Sucker thinks he can play me for a fool.
I’m a entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: You sure are, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Shut up, bitch. Don’t be Ed McMahonning
me every time I open my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Ah, shit…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Ooooow!… alright, man, ease off…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You always did have style.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: It’s one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: So are you, Pop-Sweet. That’s why…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Fuck, Kittle… why you got to go doin’
that?!</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: This shit was Ming.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: That’s the problem with expensive tastes…
the more you got, the more you got to lose.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Where’s your pet gorilla and the female
Uncle Tom?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: They’re… around.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Yeah? So, what do you want to ask today
that I can’t answer? I’m a busy man.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: The way Zimmermann takes such good care of
you and this drug-peddling “escort service” of yours, I figure you got
the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Well, let me tell you how it is…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: … son of a bitch… broke my fucking
arm…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: I’m gonna cut off your flippin’ head and
use it for a candy dish…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Talk like that, I might forget to call an
ambulance. Now, tell me again, how’s the dope arriving?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>pinkeye</strong>: You’re the one gonna be needing an
ambulance, white boy…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Outside.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: … Nena… Billy…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Who you talkin’ too, Kittle?</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: They ain’t there, turkey. You’re all by
your lonesome!</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Stop day-dreaming, lard ass. Where’s
Kittle?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: He went to pick up lunch.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Well, shake a leg. Get these files
downstairs… And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Why the hell are you calling me
here?</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Your children played with their guns in
front of me again today. This upsets me.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Suspending those three is about as
useful as giving a speeding ticket to Evil Knievel.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: No. I’ve had my fill. I want them taken
out of the game. Hello?! Still on the line?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: What you’re asking… goes against
every code of honor…</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: I can… make certain arrangements.
But, it’ll cost extra.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Name your price.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Pluck this thorn from my paw, and you’ll
have them, with my gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Vinchenzo… forgive me for letting
business trifles distract my attention. On to more important pursuits,
eh? Come, come… I have a surprise…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: It arrived today. You won’t believe it,
even when you see…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Stradivarius. Antonius Stradivarius of
Cremona, post seventeen hundred. One of perhaps five hundred and forty.
Absolutely priceless. I was born in Newark, New Jersey, Vinchenzo, as
far away from this moment as I think you could ever get. My family lived
each day in poverty. I wasn’t expected to make anything of myself.
Failure was a given.</p>
<p><strong>vinchenzo</strong>: May I…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: These hands… These are the hands of a
grocery clerk… of a janitor, and then a numbers runner who fought and
clawed and battled, by hook or by crook, to get his piece of the
American dream. These hands were not destined to caress a Stradivarius,
And yet… The impossible.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What the… ?! What was that for?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: How come everyone thinks hitting me’s the
best way to get my attention?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We have to find Kittle.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Okay. But, what changed our mind?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up
and running.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Wait a minute… he’s back…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Kittle… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s nohody’s fault but mine. I got
blindsided.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: We shoulda been there to back you up. We
shoulda!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Stop blaming yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Nothing’s broke. Keep sewing. And quit
pacing, you big ox. You’re making me skittish.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I’ll kill ’em…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Let’s go! Fuck everything! God damn sons
of bitching mother humpers… I’m gonna rip’em all brand new assholes…
!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Hey… HEY! Cool down, Jumbo!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We’re going out. But, here’s the situation,
and here’s how it’s gonna go down…</p>
<p><strong>lock-up guard</strong>: Kittle, what the hell? You look like
shit…</p>
<p><strong>lock-up guard</strong>: Fuck, man… I was only kidding… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Unlock the door.</p>
<p><strong>lock-up guard</strong>: I… I can’t do that…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Now! Unless you want your head to make a
whistling sound on windy days.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Any preferences?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Whatever goes bang.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I can’t believe we’re stealing.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We’re not stealing. We’re borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: No, we’re stealing.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: This is the police lock-up. We’re police. How
can we steal from ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Then, why’d we tie him up?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We’re stealing, okay! Quit yackin’ and do it
faster.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Ay Dios mio…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: So far so good. We’re past the point of no
return.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Let’s get this thing done.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: All for one…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: … and fuck ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m gonna put a great big,
ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face. How ’bout that?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m here. That’s all that counts. Watch…
you’ll enjoy this… it’s like magic…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s our gift to you. Something you’ve
always wanted…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Our resignations.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: You going rogue on me?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: What happened, Kittle? We used to be
friends. You used to know how the game was played.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts
and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after
shaking down some honest Joe?</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: There was a time when you did things
the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the
soul-sister.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Oh, there’s one more thing… Now, where did I
put that… ? Uh… oh, here it is…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: You’re washed up, Kittle! You’re all
done!</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Good riddance.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I’m gonna let you in on a secret. See, that
wasn’t my “voodoo music” I was listening to before.</p>
<p><strong>captain albert</strong>: Burn in hell, whore!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Alright, flesh-peddler, let’s see empty
hands!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Out here. On your knees.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: You can’t do this to me! Who the fuck do
you think you are!?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Who am I, you say? I am one angry, angry
man…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I knew I shoulda used a 9-iron.</p>
<p><strong>lord caviar</strong>: Lose the guns or I’ll smoke you!</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Looks like you got it all backasswards
again, Kittle…</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: You thought you got hurt last time… you
ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Billy… !</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Fore!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Go! I’ll finish this.</p>
<p><strong>lord caviar</strong>: Are you that good, sister? Think you
can handle us both?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: They don’t call it a <U>black</U> belt for
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Outta the way! Move!</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Oh my Lord, no!!</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: No, no, no! Stop this!</p>
<p><strong>shop owner</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Make way!</p>
<p><strong>pop-sweet</strong>: Fire! Fire!!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: - Fucking first amendment violation…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Kittle!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Ah, jeez, Billy… careful!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t you let him fall! You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Don’t drop him! We need him…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: … alive.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Kill them, Poe. Find them, and make them
very dead.</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: Arrest them. Brimg them to me. Bring
them to justice!</p>
<p><strong>officer jim</strong>: A.P.B. came over the radio. They just
declared open season on the Three Stooges.</p>
<p><strong>officer steve</strong>: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You get him?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy’s one
man war on crime.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Who said it wa’s me, hub? Anyway… he fell
off a ladder. It wasn’t really my fault.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Well, I got something.. Pop-Sweet’s accounting
ledger for the Disco-Strip. All the money transactions. Look… Someone’s
putting their initials beside the weekly totals. Like they’re
acknowledging a deposit.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: “A.D.”</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Who’s that? Zimmermann’s money-man?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: If it is, that’s pretty high up on the totem
pole. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Gimmie a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Alright… how about you two hit the strip and
start knocking some heads together? Find out who “A.D.” is. I got a
quick errand to run.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Where you gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s personal. We’ll hook up at Billy-Boy’s
pad in an hour. See ya then.</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: I… I can explain…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m looking at this poster, and I’m
thinkin’, I don’t remember seeing films like this when I was in
school.</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: I was going to tell him.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What were you gonna say? Exactly how did you
think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school
teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: But… I love him. I do…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: All I know is, you’re setting up my pal for
the world’s biggest broken heart.</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: Let me tell him. Let him decide.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You’re not gonna see him again.</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: What… what makes you think you can
order me around?!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Maybe I’m not making myself clear. You’re
probably the first girl Billy-Boy’s ever fallen in love with, and I know
for sure you’re the first he’s slept with. So, how’s he gonna feel… …
when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who
didn’t have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hasn’t he got enough problems, or didn’t you
notice that’s not cream soda on his breath?</p>
<p><strong>“school-marm”</strong>: … okay… you made your point.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You live like a pig.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Can’t you say something nice once?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Okay. It doesn’t smell as bad in here as I
remember it smelling.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Been waiting long?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Just got here.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: How’d we do?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: A.D. is a C.P.A.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Come again… ?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.
But, that’s all we got.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Maybe it’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: No offices are gonna be open today.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of
their homes. It’s a tax dodge.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Bad news is, word’s spreading like wildfire
that we don’t have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered
like Butch Cassidy either.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: If we don’t catch a break soon, we’re
gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Speak for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Bingo. Got him… Let’s pay Archibald a
visit.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What do you got there, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: She… she’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>kitile</strong>: Dear Billy… been thinking about us… decided
you’re too good for me. I don’t deserve you… Don’t try to find me…
Sorry, kid. That’s a tough break.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: He’s taking this better than I thought he
would.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Whoa, whoa… it’s gonna be alright.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: … where… where’s a jerk like me ever
gonna find another girl to love him… huh?…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Don’t talk like that. There’s plenty of women
around for jerks like you.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You’re lying…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You’re a good guy, Billy. These things
happen…</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Destroy a man’s Steelers shrine. That’s a
declaration of war!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Okay, we got… one, two… three… Two
Caddies and Poe’s Mustang.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Could be worse. I don’t know how, but I’m
sure it could.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging
it?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I’m waiting till the time’s right.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well, sometime before we’re all dead would
be nice, if it’s not too much fucking trouble, yellow-belly!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: He’s too far back.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Yoo-hoo! Flipped his lid!</p>
<p><strong>officer steve</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>officer jim</strong>: Sure as shit I did.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: This is completely, Goddamn
unacceptable!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Get his attention.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Your wish is my command.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: This one’s for McDoogle’s kid!!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Bye-bye bad guy!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hey-Ho… ! Maybe we’re not alone in this
thing after all.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Who is that… ?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Far out, man! Get those bastards!</p>
<p><strong>officer steve</strong>: Fucking hot-dogging vice pricks.
Let’s see how hot you are now… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What the hell’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You mean, besides the warrant out on us for
blowing up our commanding officer?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Remember those two uniform cops who been
giving us such a hard time… ?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: The ones you got in that fist-fight with
a couple a weeks ago… ?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: That’s them trying to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well, they sure know how to hold a
grudge.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Interesting choice.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Okay… it just got worse…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Whatever we’re gonna do, we should do it
now.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Um… wrong way. See, the bad men are back
there, and we want to go <U>away</U> from them!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You’re… you’re not doing what I think you’re
doing… ?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Seatbelts fastened, please.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Even if we make it.. which we <U>won’t</U>… we
don’t know what’s on the other side!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Oh, no… no, no, no!!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Look, Kittle… pull over and let me out.
I’ll be fine… okay? How ’bout that… ? Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me… I
don’t want to die!! Lemme out of this coffin!!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Clench your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Wh… what… ?!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Clench your teeth so when we land you don’t
accidentally bite off your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>thug-one</strong>: Bitch can’t hit a thing.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman golfer</strong>: That’s peculiar. Winter rules, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: That’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping
Capital of the World.</p>
<p><strong>naked body-builder</strong>: ’Scuse me, fella… I need to see
your invitations.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Or what? You gonna hit us over the head with
your penis?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Take your baby-lotioned hands off him, Zeus.
Good. Now, come here…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You’re gonna tell us where Archie the
accountant is. But first…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Try to guess which part of your body’s going
in here.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Now, that’s what I call diving for –</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: This is private property. This is breaking
and entering!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Just entering. We’ll get to the breaking in
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Whatever you fuzz are sniffing for, I don’t
have it. You came to the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You’re Zimmermann’s calculator, Archie. All
the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to
know something. Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you
weren’t supposed to hear…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I’m telling you, you’re barking up the wrong
tree.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well, I’m running out of trees, so look me
in the eye like a man and tell me you don’t know! Convince me!</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I don’t know. Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You suck at lying, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: See… now that we know you know, the hard
part’s done for us.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: It’s just a question of how long do we have to
slap you silly till you spill the beans.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: If this deal goes smooth, I clear three
hundred fifty grand. That’s enough for three more houses like this. And,
what are you offering me instead, other than a black eye and a fat
lip?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah… there, just like that… Okay, go ahead.
But first take a good look around at how I’m living, and then think
about your own shitty lives…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I know the drill. Maybe I can’t stop you
from beating on me… but, I’ll heal up. It doesn’t change the fact that
cops eat hamburgers and hot dogs while crooks eat lobster and
caviar.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It’s not even like there’s a choice to be
made, so… do whatever you feel like you have to do.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m well aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to
shout it out, genius.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Adam and Eve. Never one without the
other.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s our names, don’t wear’em out.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Indivisible and inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Incestuous.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Every person’s got their own kinks, beef-cake.
What’s wrong, Kittle? You don’t swing?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What Eve and I wouldn’t give to meet up with
you on the business end of a daisy chain.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking,
or we’re out the door.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: A little birdie whispered in my ear today…
about the needle-candy you’re chasing. It’s up here… … in the old
curiosity shop.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I figure, for this information, the usual
payment… times ten.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You think it’s that good?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll tell you what… I think it’s all you’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well… what can I do? You’ve created a
dilemma… And, look at the that. Time’s running out. I wonder… how can I
impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for
me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Bastards… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You get nothing and like it. And if we’re
not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the
fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay, man, okay. I’m with you. I… I heard how
the shit’s arriving… It’s coming in a Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: And… ?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What and? That’s what I got.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln
Continental? Lincoln Mark Five… Six… ?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Now you know what to watch for…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Am I supposed to take this information and
sit up in the hills with a frickin’ telescope?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: This much powder you don’t throw in the trunk
with a blanket over it. It’s got to be smuggled.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: There’s not even enough places to stash it
in a car.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Have I ever steered you wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Cuff’em. Let’s see what these two love birds
say once they’re sitting in separate cages.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Get off her, monster! Leave her alone… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Take her down to the car, and for Christ’s
sake be careful this time. Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers
dropped her down the stairs. What a mess. Why is it we don’t appreciate
our arms and legs till we’ve lost the use of them?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, listen… I’ll give you something else,
Kittle. Anything. Remember… remember that corpse washed up on Huntington
Beach? It was never identified…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Alright, wait… there’s a dentist in Brentwood
peddling morphine…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Careful she doesn’t hit her head on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Come on, don’t you screw with her, please!
You… you got to want this: armored car job. CalTrust Bank. They took two
million in cash…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Hold up a minute, Kittle.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We’ll take the CalTrust heist, but if it’s
no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine
and he will beat you to death with it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: They’re there, laying low. It’s Allison and
Hinchberger’s crew. Lunatics, every one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: When you planning to cut back on that?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: The booze.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I don’t know. I could quit now if I
wanted, I just don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Sure you could.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I don’t know what the problem is. Plenty
of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Name one.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Dean Martin.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Entertainers don’t count.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What about Jack Daniels? Wasn’t he a
decorated general in the Civil War?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: General Jim Beam, then.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Oh. Well. I think it’s pretty common
knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off
his ass.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Who’s been giving you history lessons? Your
bartender?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You’ve never heard of Napoleon brandy,
Mister Smarty-Pants? How do you think it got its name?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Billy, I love you I really do… but I’ve got to
tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word
“stupidity.”</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What can I say to that… except, I love
you too, you mean-spirited bitch.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: … This is the police. We don’t want trouble…
just come out with your hands up…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Put down your weapons and surrender. I’m not
kidding… this is your last chance. Stop trying to kill us’, or we will
be forced to return fire…</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: If anybody’s still alive over there… now
would be a good time for you to run away.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah? I got nothing to say to you… huh?
How’s that… I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>redhead</strong>: Hello? Yeah… I need to talk to Mister
Zimmermann.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You could start over again with cash like
that.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Go wherever you want. Live how you want.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: No more counting the big money for someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Beholden to none.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s six o’clock. Time’s runaing out.
Decide.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: If I tell you, how do I know you won’t just
club me and take it back?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You don’t. It’s a gamble. But, not even in
Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash. This is <U>two
million</U>, Archie. It’s not three houses, it’s twelve. It’s dreams
come true.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Risk it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: It just got here. Like you said, it took
about a week from New York…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden
inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln. A parade float.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Abe Lincoln…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You see how perfect it is? It’s the fucking
Trojan “horse,” man. Nobody suspects a thing…</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: All Zimmermann has to do is sit back at his
party tonight and wait till the parade’s done. The floats go to some
warehouse afterwards, where there’s no guards cause it’s all garbage in
the morning anyhow. So, while the city sleeps, Zimmermann’s guys show up
and empty it out. It’s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>poe</strong>: Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: What’d they do to my boy?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: … Billy, no… it’s… me…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: They… they shot me.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: They shot us all, kid.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: What day is it?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Same day as before. I think.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: We’re gonna rain on Zimmermann’s parade.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Nena. Nena…</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Well, don’t just stand there… help a lady
tighten her tourniquet.</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: I want men guarding their rooms. As
soon as they wake up, I want them booked. If they die, I want their dead
bodies arrested.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Everybody take off your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: How you doing back there?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Feeling great.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Feels like there’s a bullet still in my
chest.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: There probably is.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Bummer.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: A moment of your time, friends! A mere
moment… I welcome you, on this the occasion of America’s 200th birthday.
Times like this, I become a sentimental dolt, so I beg your
indulgence.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Our country has been called the land of
opportunity. And, a wiser man than I once made the observation that the
older you get, the longer it takes you to get to the door when
opportunity knocks. But, didn’t Thomas Jefferson say it best when he
said… Motherfucking cocksuckers!! I’ll… I’ll kill them… !</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Think Zimmermann’s watching?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Who the fuck knows? We’ll find out soon
enough.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Wilshire Boulevard! Wilshire Boulevard!
Kill them!!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It turns my stomach they’re using Honest Abe
to smuggle their filth.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Sorry, old buddy.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Billy! Billy!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Take us to the beach! Santa Monica… ! The
beach!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: The beach… the beach…</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Alright, big-fella, don’t you go passing
out! You’re fine and dandy. You’ve had worse than this.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Why the beach?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: So there’s nobody around to get killed in
the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Oh, yeah… the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Know what I love about dynamite?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Do tell.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: When you bunch it together, it’s
exponentially more powerful. Two sticks have the power of four sticks.
Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Well, that’s what I heard, and that’s what I
choose to believe.</p>
<p><strong>redcoat-one</strong>: There! Over there… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Know what I love about dynamite?</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Kittle… we got company!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: The gang’s all here!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Keep ’em busy.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: That’s my heroin! Move it! Get beside
the son of a bitch! Now, now, now!</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Die, Kittle… you self-righteous
prick!</p>
<p><strong>one child</strong>: Dud.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Hold your fire! You hear… ?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Run them off the road! Shoot the driver!
Just don’t shoot Abraham Lincoln!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Gimmie a butt.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: You don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: I’m not taking a cigarette break, jackass,
just give me one!</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: <U>Rude</U>!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: God Bless America!</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Kittle! A little help here… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Hang on, honey… I’m coming…</p>
<p><strong>redcoat-two</strong>: Goodbye, bitch…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: Behind you… !</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Thanks, doll,</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Oh, Lord…</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: NO!!</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Go! Go… !</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Holy hell.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: You fuckers… damn you! Why?! Why me!?
Why the obsession with me?</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: It’s our job.</p>
<p><strong>zimmermann</strong>: You think you accomplished something…
like you’re heroes? Fuck you! This is meaningless! You’ll never win! You
know, as soon as I’m gone… someone’s going to take my place.</p>
<p><strong>kittie</strong>: We’ll burn that bridge when we get to
it.</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: Don’t just stand there. Arrest
them.</p>
<p><strong>kittie</strong>: The captain was dirty.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: He tried to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: We’ve got the tape to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: Arrest them! What are you waiting for?!
Do it! Someone arrest them!</p>
<p><strong>d.a. ravich</strong>: You! You… I’m ordering you to take them
into custody this instant!</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Do it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Good. Thought I was imagining them.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: I saw ’em too. Fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>kittle</strong>: Happy Independence Day.</p>
<p><strong>billy-boy</strong>: Yeah. Happy Fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>nena</strong>: You too.</p>
