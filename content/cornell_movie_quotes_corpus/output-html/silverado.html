<h1 id="silverado">silverado</h1>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto
you’re riding hung around.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You got no idea what they were after?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Offend anybody lately?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Not for five years.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Jefferson City?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: No, Leavenworth.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ve never been in there. They just jumped
you out of the blue?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I had to get up anyway.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Me, I’m riding along, minding my own
business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a
while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach
life like everybody’s your friend or nobody is… don’t make much
difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly
everybody’s pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse.
She’s a great one, a sweet little bay.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Looks like that’s not all they admired.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Yup. The whole rig. I don’t care much about
the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn’t kill me.
That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left
me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was
no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Looks like those boys are headed south, so
they weren’t the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where’s the pinto going?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where’s Turley?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: South of here, past Chimayo.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Maybe I’ll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me
some clothes. Maybe a bath.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Yeah, maybe a bath.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Is this loaded?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’ll get these horses tended.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’m good for it.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Excuse me, there –</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll be with you in a moment, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Just a minute there, fella. When I’m done
with this lady –</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: That one’s twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: How much to borrow it?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: These guns are for sale.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What can I get for that?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s it take?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: This is extra.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: This is the man, Sergeant. He claims the
animal was stolen.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: How do I know this is your horse?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Can’t you see this horse loves me?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I had a gal do that to me, but that didn’t
make her my wife.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ll tell you what, on the underside of this
saddle I got my name scratched. Take a look and you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oh, yeah, and what would your name be?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Paden.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Hello, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Hello, Paden. How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You know this man, Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I surely do.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Let’s see that saddle.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: All right, move along, folks. Get these
children out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I see you’re prospering without
me.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Where’s the dog?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Appreciate the loan. I’m good for it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Let’s talk about that. I’m looking for
some men.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ve given that up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: So have I. I’ve got a legitimate job
now. I can use a guy like you.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’ve got a legitimate job.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Yes, sir. You wouldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I
finally found my place in the world.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Well I’m real happy for you, Cobb. But I
think I’ll keep looking for mine.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He’s getting out.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: C’mon, this’ll interest you.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Look who’s here, Tyree. It’s our old
riding buddy.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I invited Paden to join us, but he’s
not having any.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Where’s the dog?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You owe me thirteen bucks.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Thirteen… bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I see what you like, she’s mighty
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: And bridle-wise, too. She’s the only thing I
lost I really cared about. ’Cept for maybe my hat. It’s a great one. Got
a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. I
surely do miss that hat.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I gotta be going.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Going to Turley, was it?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Gotta meet a guy and head out for
Silverado.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s Turley like?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: It’s a town…</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: They got a saloon there?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I expect.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Women?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I expect.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Maybe you want to ride along with me as far
as Turley.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Maybe… I’ll ride along… as far as Turley.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Baxter, Hawley, where the hell have you
been? You’re late! And I’ll tell you, I don’t like it. It’s a bad start,
boys.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: I’ve got my people sitting down there…
…swatting flies and raring to go.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’m afraid it is a bad start, friend, ’cause
my name isn’t Baxter, and he ain’t Hawley.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: You’re not Baxter?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: My name is Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: And you’re not Baxter, either?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: No, I’m not Hawley.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Well, god-dammit! God-dammit!</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: They ain’t Baxter and Hawley! Where the hell
are Baxter and Hawley!</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Quit your yelling, old man. We’re right
here.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Who you calling an old man?</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Calm down, Mr. Hobart. I’m Nord Baxter. That
there is my partner, Tom Hawley.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: You’re late. It’s a bad start, boys.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Yes, sir. We’ll just have to get you people
to Silverado that much quicker.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: All right. Let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: You remember my letter, don’t you,
Mr. Hobart? Half now and half when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: I remember, I remember. C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Open the box, Eb.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Don’t you want to count it?</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Not at all, friend. We trust you. Now let’s
get this train on its way to Silverado.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: …He’s about my size, energetic young fella,
wears two guns in a fancy rig. He’d be a stranger here.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I don’t know him, I told you. I ain’t seen
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I haven’t had a drink of whiskey or slept in a
bed for ten days. Give me a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Hey! What are you doing, buck?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Having a drink.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: No, you’re not. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I haven’t had a drink of whiskey or slept in a
bed for ten days.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: You ain’t getting them here.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’m real sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Doesn’t look quite fair.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Which way do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: What’s all this then?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: This nigger’s breaking up my place,
Sheriff Langston.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: I don’t like that word much, Carter.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: We don’t serve them here and you know
it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for
this damage.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: ’Fraid not, Sheriff. These other fellas
started the ruckus.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: There are three strangers in this room,
traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren’t them. Are these your
friends?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to
the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Came to the wrong town. I don’t tolerate
this kind of thing. It’s hard on the peace, and it’s hard on the
furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I’m going to let you go
without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Is there a place in town that takes… my
kind?</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: You misunderstand. I want you out of town.
In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: That ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: I decide what’s right in this
jurisdiction. Now move.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Who’s going to pay for all this,
Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Don’t press your luck, Carter.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Now let’s talk about you chaps.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: We’d rather stay.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: We’ll see about that. I’m Sheriff John
Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: But the good citizens of Turley have taken
me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So
when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you
come for the hanging?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’m just meeting a guy here and moving on.
So far I haven’t been able to find him.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: In my town, when you’re looking for
someone, you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: All right. I’m looking for a young fella,
full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: I know where that gentleman is.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Now I want everyone to behave himself.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Emmett! Am I glad to see you!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Howdy, Jake. What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I
think we ought to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All I did was kiss a girl.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That’s why they got you in jail?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn’t like
it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So I did, I got out of there, I don’t want no
trouble. You know me. So I walked out on the street and the fella tried
to shoot me in the back.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: …And you had to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his
gun.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You’re in here for winging a guy?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend
opened up on me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: What friend is that?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The one with the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: The dead one.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Jake, I’m going to ask you once – was it
self-defense?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Honest to God, Emmett, he would’ve killed
me.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: The jury saw it differently.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: So this is the guy you’re going to hang?</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Tomorrow morning. Ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I was afraid of that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Emmett, can’t you help me?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Jake, you know the law. You know what they
did to me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Blind Pete always said you’d hang.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I guess tomorrow at dawn he’ll be proved
right.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Ten A.M.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Right… I thought they always did it at dawn.
So long, kid. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: He is that.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’ll have to deal me out on that. I’ve had
some experience with that sort of thing, and I don’t want any more.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It’s not going to be easy.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: It never is. But he’s my brother. We’re
going to California together. But first we’re going to stop in Silverado
and see our sister. And I can’t show up there with a story like
this.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Then I guess this is where we part ways.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: No hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: C’mon, I’ll buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You haven’t got any money.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: All right, you buy me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You know, a good smelly saloon is my favorite
place in the world.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’re wearing my hat. What else you got
that’s mine?</p>
<p><strong>ugly cowboy</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
mister.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I hope your hand isn’t tickling my
bone-handled Colt. If you stand up real slow and let me see, you might
live through this night.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You’re making a big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s what I told ’em.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too.
Then you could be with all your friends.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: I want you out of town before the
hanging.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’ll be long gone.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You mean you ain’t coming with Emmett and
me?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I can’t say I’m convinced you’re going
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sure we are. We’re leaving at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ve got no reason to run. It was a fair
fight and there were plenty of witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, that’s what happened with me too.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: The other guy drew first.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Your brother seems pretty good, but it isn’t
going to be easy getting in here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He ain’t coming in, we’re going out. Gimme
your belt.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t he tell you about Blind Pete?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: We didn’t get that far.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Blind Pete taught me a great trick.</p>
<p><strong>stable boy</strong>: Sheriff! Sheriff! Open up!</p>
<p><strong>stable boy</strong>: Sheriff Langston, come quick!</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Lock this door and don’t let anybody
in.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Hey! What are you doing, you crazy kid? Don’t
do it!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Oh, Jesus! Somebody stop him!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Cut him down! For God’s sake, cut him
down!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Hurry up! You might be able to save him!</p>
<p><strong>block</strong>: What for? So we can hang him?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I think I’m going to be sick… when I see what
Langston does to you when he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>block</strong>: You get way back there.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Got to be real quiet here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s the longest I ever did it. ’Bout bust a
gut.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We wait.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where’s your brother?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Jake, come on!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think we lost ’em.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: There’s nobody coming?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Oh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>block</strong>: Let’s see you fake this one, kid.</p>
<p><strong>kern</strong>: Is that them shooting?</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: No. It’s coming from those rocks.</p>
<p><strong>kern</strong>: Let’s go. He ain’t hitting anything.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: You idiot, he’s hit everything he’s aimed
at.</p>
<p><strong>kern</strong>: …But they won’t be out of our jurisdiction
till they pass Flat Top!</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Today my jurisdiction ends here.</p>
<p><strong>langston</strong>: Pick up my hat.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This a friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: He is now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Oh, a guy who got run out of town…</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: …just like us.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: It’s okay, Zeke.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Hobart, what are you people doing here?</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: This is where Baxter and Hawley brung
us.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Well, they’re wrong. This territory is full
of bad characters.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: And they were two of them. Look –</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb here and
stole our money box. They went north and we’re going after them.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Forget the money. You’ve got to get these
people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and
kids.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Your next water ain’t for three days.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: We got no life in Silverado without that
money. Everybody put in, that’s our whole stake.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: How long have they been gone?</p>
<p><strong>mr. parker</strong>: About an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll go with you, Mal!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Deal me in.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Jake, you know the way out of here. I want
you to get this train moving toward Silverado, and fast. I’ll go with
these guys.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You men stay with your wagons and your
families. Get rolling and keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Wait a minute! If you do get the money, how
do we know you’ll come back?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: If we don’t, you can keep my brother.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: I’m trusting you, mister.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You trusted Baxter. I’m not letting these
men out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: If I’d brought a pretty lady like that into
a place like this, I’d stay close.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: That’s none of your business, mister. Let’s
get going.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I think you got a point, Emmett. Maybe I
better stay here with her.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You know, hanging around with you is no
picnic.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Anybody got any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>tall outlaw</strong>: Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: In a minute!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I wouldn’t do that. You’re going to need
every gun when that posse gets here.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Posse? What the hell you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley
and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a
ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn
canyon. You’re Dawson, ain’t you? I’m Tex LaRue. Used to ride with Ry
Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here,
so I headed for it. Hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You brought a posse to my best hideout and
you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don’t know any of those names and
you’re about to die.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Wait a minute! If you don’t believe me, ask
them… …they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: I saw ’em there, all right, but I don’t know
about any bank job.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: If you took the bank in Turley, where’s the
money?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’d get down if I were you. They may be up
there now.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: No money, eh?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The money’s in my saddlebags over there, but
I ain’t stepping out to get it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: If we charge them, they won’t have a chance.
But we gotta get to the horses.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: What do you mean, the horses?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Cover me!</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Brave man.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I think there’s only a couple of guys up
there and this asshole’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That was some idea of yours. Next time you
go in.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I knew it. Put that box on my horse.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Mister, you got a lot to learn about
people.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: After the war my family worked a little piece
of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then…
well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured
the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of
farming, I didn’t want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn’t come with
’em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister
headed out without me. They’ve got a little place south of Silverado. I
guess they’ve done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me
last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was
almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but
when it did, it was just the right time.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Chicago! You been to Chicago? Was it
wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Oh, I was just checking the, ah… …you know,
lookin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jeez, Paden, her old man ain’t even cold
yet!</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad
luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I don’t believe in luck. I know what Conrad
was like. Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Never will again.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: We got married just before this trip, so we
could come out here and try the land. It’s hard to find a man willing to
take on a life like that.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Love isn’t the only important thing.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: How you doing, m’am? Getting enough
help?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: More than enough.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Have you thought at all about your
plans?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Some. I’ve been talking to the Parkers. One
thing I know I’m not doing – I’m not going back.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south
past that rock.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Good luck, Mal.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Maybe we’ll see you sometime.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yeah… maybe. So long.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: It’s right down this road aways. I’ll ride
in with you myself. Carol, go spread the word our people are here.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I thought there’d be more of you. But I
thank the Lord for each and every one. We’ll have a solid strip of
bottomland under the plow when you people stake your claims. And we’re
going to need every hand to hold it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Hope to see you again, m’am.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I think I’ll ride along with the lady here.
Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what
makes a trip this hard worth taking. I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’ll be around.</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: I feel like I’ve arrived in Canaan.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: When we got here, we thought it was Eden.
And it’s pretty close – right down to the serpents.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join
their parcel to mine. We’ll work them together. Mine starts right over
there. It’s all I’ve ever wanted. Pretty land, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: And a pretty lady.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it’s
true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Believe it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: They’re drawn to me by that. But it never
lasts.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Because they don’t like what I want.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I want to build something, make things grow.
That takes hard work – a lifetime of it. That’s not why men come to a
pretty woman.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: After a while, I won’t be so pretty. But
this land will be.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Hannah, don’t tell me what you think I want
to hear.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come
back to see me. But I never thought it’d be my boy. I never thought
that.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: She was sick for a long time. She was sick
when she wrote you, but she didn’t say it. I never thought you’d come.
But she did.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Where is Rae?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: She’s gone, gone to town. She hated working on
the farm… …just like you.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: They run me off. They burned me out. They made
it so I couldn’t do. Just like Georgia. If you won’t sell, they take it
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear
creek. That’s why we picked this spot, and that’s why they don’t want us
here.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You own this land.</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: I paid the government for it, all right. That
don’t mean much out here. Malachi, I’m living like a wildcat in a cave
in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What about the law?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: Whose law? The law here runs a man down – just
like these cattle.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: That ain’t right and I’ve had enough of what
ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I thought running the land office would be
easy work, J.T., but it sounds like what you got here ain’t much
fun.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: We got a bad situation here, and those
homesteaders you brought in with you are going to make it worse. When
they come into this office to stake their claims, I think it’s going to
be the start of real trouble. They’re going to cut McKendrick off on the
north.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: J.T.’s done everything he can. I married a
brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of
here while we’re talking. McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so
J.T. can’t even get the law enforced.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn
up on our police force.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: A man could die of thirst before anybody
offered him a drink around here.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Maybe you all ought to come to California
with Jake and me. How ’bout it, Augie, you want to go with us?</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know, Augie, there are no schools in
California.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Augie’s going to grow up here. There’s nothing
wrong with the land, it’s just some of the people.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong
McKendrick.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Why, J.T., watch what you’re saying around
Augie. Emmett didn’t kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough,
but I think you’d have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that’s
definitely the word.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It was not – it was Murdo’s. Those McKendricks
don’t know how to act like human beings.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: His son is worse than he was. He’s smoother,
so you don’t always hear him coming, but he’ll do anything to keep his
range free.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m worried what he’s going to do when he
finds out you boys are back.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I think Jake here can take care of himself.
I did five years I didn’t owe. McKendrick ought to be satisfied with
that and let it lie.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Is that you, Ezra?</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: You see pretty good, Red. Is there one or
two of them? What brings you out of your hole, Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We’re going to find that place one of these
days. Who you got with you, Ezra?</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: This is my son. He’s come home.</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: Ain’t that sweet, Red? I’m afraid you boys
are trespassing on McKendrick land.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You got it all wrong, mister. This is our
place.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: What? Mr. McKendrick bought this place from
your father.</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: That’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Tomorrow we’re going to town to straighten that
out once and for all. The next day we’ll be back here… farming. And
these cattle better be gone.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: If I find any cattle on our land after
tomorrow, I’m going to start carving them into steaks. And believe me,
that’s one thing I know about.</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: Killing cattle is a hanging offense in
these parts. If we shot you down right now, we’d be within our
rights.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Mister, you ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
in the hands of someone who knows how to use it?</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: Who would that be? You?</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: This ain’t the end of it!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We’re going to get your land back, Daddy… our
land.</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: Maybe we will! Maybe we will! After all, I
never thought I’d get my son back.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What can I do you for, stranger?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You work here?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I run the place. What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Nifty.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: The world is what you make of it, friend. If
it doesn’t fit, you make alterations.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss
–</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Stella.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Paden.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Stella… Are you the midnight star
herself?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I am. I’m always there, but I only shine at
night.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is
what I call a saloon.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Thanks. That’s what I call it too.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: And I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You like a good saloon?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It’s the only place I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Me too. What’s wrong with us?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You wouldn’t be needing any help around here,
would you? Maybe with the gambling?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You see that fellow over there in the gray
coat?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: That’s Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs
that side.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: So-called?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying
cheat, he’s just the man I would have picked.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Why’d you go into business with him?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I don’t own this place. The man who does
stuck me with Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Who’s the owner?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Here he comes right now.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Well, look at this! Two of my favorite
people in the world, talking to each other.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Stella, this is one of my oldest
surviving friends. Treat him right.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: That was my plan.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Oh, yeah, you two are going to get
along fine. You got a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Kelly, get over here. You didn’t come
all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? Kelly, meet my
friend Paden.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Give the man a line of credit. He
already owes the house thirteen bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You got a place to stay?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I just got to town.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Stella, we still got an extra room out
back, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: It’s not in use at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: What brings you into my saloon?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Luck, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Good old Paden. I was hoping you’d
changed your mind about the job.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You didn’t tell me you owned a saloon.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: That ain’t the half of it, friend.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Welcome to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: Where’s the other one, Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: You couldn’t leave well enough alone, could
you, old man? Our orders are to run you two off. If you tell us where
your son is, we won’t have to do any shooting.</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: You’re lying, Hoyt… like always.</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: Not this time. I got my orders.</p>
<p><strong>ezra</strong>: My son’s on his way to town.</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: That’s too bad. You’ll have to go by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Hannah’s a smart, pretty woman, but she’s got
a hard idea for living.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: All I’m saying is, you won’t trip over me if
you look her up.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’m going to California with my brother.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He’s a
friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Pleasure is mine. Always happy to meet
a friend of Paden’s. Stella, bring Kelly out here, will you?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You’re Kate Hollis’ brother, aren’t
you? You’re the one who killed old Murdo McKendrick.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Didn’t have much choice. He was about to
shoot my brother in the back.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Can’t be having that now can we?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: We’re going to make some adjustments.
I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could
do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our
profits.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I’m done talking. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: How about it, Paden? You want the
job?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I see you’re an understanding boss.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Nothing like that will happen between
us.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Maybe we ought to ask Stella.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You’d be welcome.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: No, Kelly! He’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Thanks for warning me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Didn’t have much choice.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I never enjoy killing a man.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Excuse me, Sheriff. I’m a gambler who would
like to run an honest game in your town. To whom do I speak about that?
I hope it’s not this gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I gotta get somebody to clean up this
mess.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You used to ride with that guy?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’re you doing? I told you to practice with
a horse that’s not moving.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I got things to do, kid. I’m a busy man.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A grown man can’t have a little boy with him
everywhere he goes.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Who’s a grown man?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Is this a fair mix?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’m saving lives here. The straight stuff
would raise a blood blister on boot leather.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: That’s the good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Oh, yeah? How good?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Here’s to the good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: May it last a long time.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You better get out here.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my job.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t believe a lady has to explain anything
to a man this ugly.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s the problem here?</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Stay out of it, Paden.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: He can’t do that, Tyree. Cobb’s hired
him.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: That’s Cobb’s mistake.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Come out of there, Phoebe. You’ve done
enough.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Get out of here, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All I did was kiss the girl.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: That’s what you said in Turley. You remember
how that ended.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s the matter, Paden? You afraid I
couldn’t get those two behind me?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I don’t want you getting anyone in my
place.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: I should have killed you a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Why not now?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Don’t do it, Tyree. I just lost a partner.
If you kill him, I’ll never get anyone to work here.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Better start looking.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: You really are a gambler.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Give me some of the good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hello, Rae.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: What are you doing here? I thought you were
done with our family.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Daddy’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: He was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’m not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am
sure, they’re going to pay.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Oh that’s just fine. Where were you when Ma and
Daddy needed you? It’s too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all
you can think of is to get yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Are you all right, Rae?</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Will you introduce me to your friend?</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: He’s not my friend. He used to be my
brother.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Calvin Stanhope… but my mother called me
Slick.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: I know what you’re thinking, mister, but I
think Rae’s a special lady. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What are you doing here, Rae? This ain’t for
you.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: It’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Rae, all we got is each other.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: I don’t have any family any more.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Don’t fall off of there, you fools!</p>
<p><strong>hobart</strong>: Might do them some good, Daniel. I wasn’t
worth a damn until I fell off the barn on my head.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. parker</strong>: Hannah’s the hardest-working gal I ever
saw.</p>
<p><strong>mr. parker</strong>: It’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I wish you the best, Mrs. Parker.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The Parkers seem like nice folks.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: They’ve been kind to me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Paden sends his best.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I guess I put a good scare into him.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m surprised to see you out here
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I just came out to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for
California soon.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You came all the way out here to tell me
you’re going to California? All you had to do was go, and we’d never see
each other again.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You don’t make it easy on a fellow.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Didn’t Paden tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Maybe you thought you’d be back this way
someday.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Yeah… that must have been it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s two more out there walking home, if
they can walk.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Sorry ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Where’d you get this horse, kid?</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: This is my uncle’s horse.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: The hell it is.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: What’s the problem, Swann?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Yeah, what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: McKendrick.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: I didn’t know you were out.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Did it seem short to you?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: That’s all over as far as I’m concerned,
Emmett. I’m satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: All right then. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Mr. McKendrick, don’t you recognize that
pinto?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: That’s Lee’s horse.</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: Shut up, Swann.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Wait a minute. Get down off of there,
Augie.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The man who lost this horse must have been
working for you. I should have known. But you changed your brand,
Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: A lot of things changed when my father
died.</p>
<p><strong>hoyt</strong>: Mr. McKendrick, he was one of them last night
at Bradley’s.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: This is a brutal land.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You must have known that before you
came.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It’s one thing to know it…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack. He
said he’d… look into it. I can’t believe he’s the law out here. Now I
see why you all wear guns.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: How’s Mr. Parker doing?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Just like you’d think. But he’s not going to
run. We’re sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: He must be pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: He’s good, all right. Too good for my
men. That’s why you’ve got to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: What about his brother?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: We’ll handle that. He’s careless.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Things are getting messy around here.
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: I heard that too.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Did you hear his son is still
around?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Cobb, looks like you’re finally going to
earn your money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: This’ll be for Paden.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: It’s an advance. We want him to know
he’s going to be happy here.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I thought you two would get along.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: From what I’ve seen, Paden doesn’t care much
about money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: He says he doesn’t care about
anything, but he does. There’s just no telling what it’s going to
be.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Howdy, Mr. Slick.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Let me tell you about your friend
Paden. Me and him and Tyree and a few other boys did a good bit of
riding together a few years back. Business, you know, and business was
pretty good. We were moving around a lot, the way you have to in that
work, and somewhere along the line we picked up this dog. One of the
boys took to feeding it, so it followed us everywhere. Anyway, this one
time we were leaving a little Missouri town in quite a hurry, with a
bunch of the locals on our tails. The dog somehow got tangled up with
Tyree’s horse and Tyree went flying. Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped
up, so he shot the dog. Didn’t kill him, though. Before you know it,
Paden’s off his horse and holding the dog. He’d gone all strange on us.
Said we should go on without him. I thought he was kidding at first. But
he wasn’t. Tyree was ready to plug ’em both. And all this with the posse
coming down on us. Here I thought we were pals after all that riding.
And suddenly he’s more worried about a mutt. So we did like he asked and
left him. He went to jail for a dog.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: And you want to hear the funny part?
Paden didn’t even like the damn dog.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It evened out in the end. They locked me up,
but the dog sprung me.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Where’s the dog now?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: He left me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: C’mon, Paden, I’ll buy you a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I took out thirteen dollars.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: This is a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I told you this was a sweet
set-up.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It is that.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Maybe you could run it without
Stella.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: This is her life. I’ll go before she
does.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Easy, boy. Just an idea.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Well, thanks, but forget it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You know, Paden, what makes all this
work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing
some trouble. It’s going to take a little straightening out. I have my
responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with
us.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What is it you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Nothing. Do nothing. Don’t get between
us.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’m a great believer in doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: So we understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Don’t worry about me. If you’re taking on
Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: You’re empty, mister.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: Ain’t you dead yet, mister?</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Cobb said he’d be hard to kill.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Guess you couldn’t hear us coming. He was
practicing so hard for a fight, he missed the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: So long, stranger.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I don’t want to kill you, and you don’t want to
be dead. Drop your guns.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He can’t be that good, Tyree.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Do you want to find out?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think we should do like he says.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: …Gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Someplace safe. How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’d be worse if you hadn’t come along.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I didn’t just come along. I was looking for
you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me
about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one
of McKendrick’s men. I wanted to see it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This was my father’s. The men who killed him
took it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I gotta get to my brother. If they came
after me, they’ll want him too.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Have to.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’ll go. I’ll bring Jake out here.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Be careful. You’re in it now. And it’s gonna
get mean.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: So far that’s all I seen in this life.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Augie, I’ve had enough of this. Kiss your
father and get in bed.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No sign of him yet? He ain’t at the saloon
either.</p>
<p><strong>watching cowboy</strong>: Where is that boy?</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Get out. We have nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Rae, I need help.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Why come to me?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Because you’re my sister. There’s nobody else.
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: What’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: They’re watching the Hollis place. I can’t get
through.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: What makes you think I could?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Why would they stop you?</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Because I’m your sister.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Why him?</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Shut up. You need help, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Jake said he’d meet you behind the church. Be
careful. They’re all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You must be Ezra Johnson’s boy.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Don’t shoot the sheriff. It’s against
the law.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: So’s killing a deputy.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: We’re going to give you a fair
trial…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: …followed by a first-class
hanging.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Or you can ride out of here before
dawn.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: All you gotta do is tell me where to
find your friend Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Did your brother tell you he killed a
deputy?</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Jake never showed up. Sheriff Cobb arrested
Mal. Took him off to jail.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What’s going on here, Rae?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Why are they doing this, Mal?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Because they enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I heard from Stella you were trying to find
Jake. What happened to Emmett?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Cobb’s men just about killed him. That’s what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I got there just short of too late.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yeah, it’s working out real good.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where’s Emmett now?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You’re working for Cobb these days, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Your friends have been beating me to find that
out. You think I’m gonna just tell you?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You waltzed in here pretty easy, and you can go
out the same way. Me they’re figuring to carry out.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: It looks bad, Rae. He’s a hard man, and he
won’t give them what they want. It’s gonna cost him.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: Can’t you stop them?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Rae? It’s Phoebe.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Looking for Jake? Jake’s been with me all
evening. I just left him.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: He went home.</p>
<p><strong>rae</strong>: All evening? Even after Slick came?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Slick?</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Take a long look, lady. It’s the last you’ll
see of him.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>scruffy</strong>: He saw you.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: Bring him with us.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Help J.T.!</p>
<p><strong>neighbor woman</strong>: Where’s Augie? Her boy must be
upstairs!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No, no… they took him. They took my Augie.</p>
<p><strong>townsman</strong>: Fire! The land office is on fire!</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Shall we take a look?</p>
<p><strong>townsman</strong>: There’s no way! It’s a goner!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I hate to see this kind of thing in my
town.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I’m going to have to look into
this.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Yeah, maybe I will too.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I thought we talked about that.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: We didn’t talk about this. They took the
little boy, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You’re still worried about the dog,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything
will be put straight in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I saw how you’re putting Mal Johnson
straight.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I never could count on you to be
reasonable. Don’t force me to make an adjustment around here.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Cobb, you’ve got nothing I need.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I’m not thinking about your future,
Paden. I’m worried about Stella.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What’s she got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Not a thing. She’s just a mutual
friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she’s going to get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: I’m just trying to save you from
yourself. Don’t change your luck.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Get some sleep, Paden. Things’ll look
better tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Can’t you drink any faster? We need the
bottles.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What is it that I can’t figure?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Cobb’s got something on you, and it must be
pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: If he didn’t you’d never sit still while
this was happening.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You sure? Maybe that’s the kind of friend I
am.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Nah! What’s he got? This is a nice saloon,
but there are other nice saloons. It’s not the money. Not for you. Why
can’t I get ahold of it? Cobb says there’s no telling what you’re going
to care about.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Is that what he said? Well, he figured it
okay this time.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: Look who’s here, Johnson, it’s your sweet
little sister. You remember her, works at The Midnight Star. Everybody
knows her.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: She wanted to see you. Course I had to search
her. I’m not sure I did a good job. Might have missed something. Only
got one good hand, you know.</p>
<p><strong>garth</strong>: Maybe I better check her a little closer.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Garth! You in there, Garth?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: To my midnight star.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Cobb’s using me to stop you. So good people
are being hurt because of me. That makes me mad.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Some people think because they’re stronger –
or meaner – they can push you around. I’ve seen a lot of that. But it’s
only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I like your attitude. But it can be
risky.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’m ready for that.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I don’t want you to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: He can’t hurt me if he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Stella, come quick!</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: She sprung her brother… all by herself! And
this is what happened… He brought her here.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: I told him about Jake and the little boy. He
went off after Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Stop your crying. Go get Doc Skinner and
bring him to the shed. Pick her up.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’ve got a place I can hide her.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: You better get in there with her until this
thing is over.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I didn’t think you were going to make it
back.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I almost didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Where’s Jake?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: McKendrick’s men got him.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s worse than that, Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: They took him at your sister’s house. Her
husband was shot. I don’t know if he’s going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She was hurt… pretty bad. Emmett, they took the
little boy with them.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Want one of these?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This oughta do.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Garth! Yo, Fox!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Get Kyle and Dusty over here. And keep
your eyes open. I’m running out of deputies.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Stella ain’t here, Sheriff. I checked her
room.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: And you don’t know where Paden is?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Haven’t seen him since last night.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Let me know if you do. And tell Stella
I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>dr. skinner</strong>: If her skin gets cold, you better come
for me.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Stampede!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Augie, where’s Jake?</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>augie</strong>: They hung him!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: They hung him?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: New record.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>emmett and augie</strong>: Jake!?!</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: It never should’ve got this far,
Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: This is as far as it’s going.</p>
<p><strong>mckendrick</strong>: I’ll do my part. But you better watch
your ass. These guys’ll shoot it off.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: I’m gonna enjoy this.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: This used to be a peaceful town.</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: What’s going on, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Hide and watch.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Better bring the doc. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>phoebe</strong>: Nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>tyree</strong>: This is no time to be on the streets. Maybe
you oughta come along with me.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Stay here till we get back. Don’t come
in.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Last one to the Midnight Star buys.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re on! Let’s get ’em!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hey, Paden…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: Don’t be afraid, baby. I’ll stay with you
until your little friend comes back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on out, boys! Jake’s in town! Let’s start
the ball!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>slick</strong>: I’m glad you’re here, Mal. I’ve been watching
her, but she needs a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Looking for this?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: What a waste. This could have been
such a sweet deal for us.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff cobb</strong>: Good-bye, Paden.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: To California!</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Weren’t you going to come out to say
good-bye?</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: I already did that.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: This time you’re really going? You know
where I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: That I do.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So long, Paden.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: You might make a farmer yet.</p>
<p><strong>paden</strong>: I’ve got a job.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Take care of your folks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’ll be back!</p>
