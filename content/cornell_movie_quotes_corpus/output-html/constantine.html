<p><strong>early production draft</strong>: November 14, 2002</p>
<p><strong>ext. istanbul - dusk</strong>: Glimpses of an ancient city.
Almost motionless against the tide of time. Sea swelled along an endless
wall. Billowing silk frozen against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine
columns. FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.</p>
<p><strong>int. prison for the criminally insane</strong>: Corridor of
ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness. Stale air hangs
in the dim half-light like atomized ether. There is WHISPERING. And
tangled VOICES. DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity – COMING TO REST ON the –</p>
<p><strong>final cell</strong>: A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite,
head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he’s not just praying.
He’s digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone
with a SPOON. After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through.</p>
<p><strong>int. narrow channel</strong>: Prisoner claws his way between
ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. He
nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS open,
sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.</p>
<p><strong>int. prisoner’s cell</strong>: The tapestry covering the HOLE
is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail.</p>
<p><strong>int. chamber - prisoner</strong>: pulls himself inside,
chokes in the heavy air. He scans the musty room. Antique furniture. A
few empty crates. And the remains of several deteriorating
skeletons.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of
light above through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed corner and slides
it under the light. He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the
hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his
foot crunches through. Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he
sees something inside – wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it out and as
he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a Nazi flag. At the center is a
crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches long. Stains on the edges. Could
be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient
arrowhead. As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious pov</strong>: From BEHIND. As if he’s being
watched by someone else. Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: starts toward the way out.</p>
<p><strong>int. prisoner corridor</strong>: The Guard’s flashlight beam
probes the cell – one by one – falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out
from the wall, revealing the hole.</p>
<p><strong>int. prison - various shots</strong>: ALARMS SOUND. Lights
BLAST ON. Guards with weapons rush through.</p>
<p><strong>int. narrow channel</strong>: Prisoner squeezes toward light,
grips the relic tight.</p>
<p><strong>ext. prison - night</strong>: SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS
sweep across the ominous structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness,
runs for the trees on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>ext. near a road - night</strong>: Prisoner breaks from the
trees, runs into a road. Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH.
Prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car. BRAKES SQUEAL – car locks
up but too late – IMPACTS Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in
a heap. CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front end sheet
metal has accordioned all the way to the tires. He scans the area for a
body, spots the Prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet.
Uninjured. Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in his
hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL has appeared as if
embossed in the flesh. Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked,
runs off. OVER this we hear – A CHILD’S SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment - day</strong>: FATHER HENNESSEY , stands over
a young teen , JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams
again.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam
laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nothing can compare with an exorcism.
Especially one that’s gone bad. The rather obese Priest tries to steady
his hands and his heart. It’s obvious he’s totally out of his league
here. GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER –</p>
<p><strong>ext. aging apartment building</strong>: Not in a third world
country but smack center in one of America’s richest cities. Sparkling
high-rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the
sexiest fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley by the apartment</strong>: A faded yellow taxi
PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps out, grinds a cigarette butt into the
asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment building - foyer</strong>: Doors open, flood
the musty darkness with a brief relief of sunlight. A MAN – whose face
we don’t see – steps inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded
wings of a raven. He pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a
cigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. narrow staircase hall wall</strong>: Lined with tenants
trying to get a glimpse of the unexplainable. The Stranger pushes
through. Suspicious faces step out of his path. The ones that don’t he
pushes aside – even the gangbangers. The man has no patience for
politeness, no time for tact, no fear of anything. This man is JOHN
CONSTANTINE. He arrives at his destination, barges into –</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment 7b</strong>: One scan of the situation is all
it takes. The bed – the child – the panicked priest – who rushes to
John.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Thank God you’re here…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is Constantine. John Constantine,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>jeanie</strong>: Vamos juntos a matarla.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s see who we got here…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need a mirror. Now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A large mirror. At least – – three feet
high.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The hallway crowd discusses
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>move.</strong>: Tenants run to retrieve a mirror. Hennessey
looks worried. John grabs the bed – shoves Hennessey aside as he swings
the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces it toward the
window.</p>
<p><strong>intercut - apartment 5g below</strong>: Several of the MEN
from the hallway crowd storm through an OLD WOMAN’S stuffy apartment,
locate a huge iron- framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from
the wall.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery
HOOKS EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window, looks
down into the alley where that yellow taxi is parked.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Chaz?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Move the car.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>move the damn car.</strong>: John frees the drapery rope,
ducks back into the room.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Park the car – Move the car…</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: There, I moved the damn car.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway</strong>: Four men struggle to carry up that
enormous mirror. The Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They
swing the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She freaks.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment 7b</strong>: Hennessey can only watch as John
threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing, drapes it back
through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan. He climbs onto the
bed, leans over the child whose eyes have closed and she’s shaking
badly. Her body seems to be going into shock. Isn’t strong enough for
this. John has no choice – slaps her. Eyes pop back open. Dark and
dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and English.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Amar natash bow basar! – Rescind from the
flesh I command thee –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s it – time to go home.</p>
<p><strong>jeanie</strong>: Tiempo para morir!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Amar natash bow basar –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lift it. Over the bed. Up.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John ducks, settles on the girl as they
raise it over him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hennessey, tie it off –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now close your eyes – all of you – and
whatever happens – do not look into the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Amar natash bow basar! – rescind from the
flesh I command thee!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: John?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not yet!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look! Look at me!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Goddamit – look!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Smile pretty you vain prick.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now, Hennessey. Now!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For your boss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ext. apartment building - huge mirror</strong>: Falls SLOW
MOTION from the 7th story – tumbling end over end, sunlight beams
glancing off the glass, PROJECTING the image of the Demon into the LA
cityscape. ONTO buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck – until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON the taxi’s
hood.</p>
<p><strong>shit!</strong>: Demon’s image SHATTERS on impact – GLASS
SPLINTERING into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city beyond. Chaz
looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment - continuous action</strong>: Jeanie GASPS –
takes her first breath as a child again. And CRIES. Mother pulls her in,
hugs her tight. Note the girl’s fingernails. No longer black. John’s
beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still burning. Takes a drag. He
pushes past Hennessey who is approaching the mother.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Now about the fee…</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment building - stairwell - later</strong>:
Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered
tenants. A few are freaked, cross themselves. Others horrified. But many
want to touch them, shake their hands. A shadowy FIGURE several floors
up stares over the rail at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the
polished veneer. This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers. JOHN pauses, gazes up
through the stairwell as if sensing something. No one there. Balthazar
is gone.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues
down the steps where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the
tenants. They’re gladly giving to the cause.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Thank you. Yes… Gracias…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hennessey.</p>
<p><strong>int. foyer</strong>: John and Hennessey stop near the front
entrance. John rips the white collar from Hennessey’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: I know, I know, but I didn’t think she
was really possessed, not like that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not back an hour and you drag me into
–</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: – Don’t be mad, John, don’t be –</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: On the left side.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Vest pocket.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t do that shit on me –</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Sorry, sorry. Here, you can have
half.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I should take it all, save you from
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: It keeps them out, so I can sleep.
Please, John, I need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley by the apartment</strong>: John turns the corner,
spots Chaz punching a dent from the taxi’s hood.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I told you to move it.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Well maybe if you had told me you were
dropping a three-hundred pound mirror with a pissed-off demon in it I
would have moved it further.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Shouldn’t have cut your stay in the land of
enlightenment. You were so close to growing a conscience.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Los Angeles…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Never ceases to entertain.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the sky</strong>: One of those perfect days. With
perfect clouds. So clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings. For a moment
they’re suspended against that incredible sky. Then gravity takes hold
and they fall back to Earth.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You still with me?</p>
<p><strong>int. subway - day</strong>: ANGELA’S weary eyes open. She’s
on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a
police-issue revolver tight. She’s pinned down, unable to move.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So what’s next, Detective? We gonna do a full
marathon?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Put your weapon on the tracks and step out
with your hands above your head.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Or how ’bout you show yourself and I put a
bullet in your skull just like I did hers!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: That’s just not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You sure about that?!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Now put down your weapon on the tracks and
–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well ain’t this a peach?!</p>
<p><strong>detective weiss</strong>: Get off the tracks! Blueline is
coming! Clear the tracks!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: C’mon, Detective, step into the light and be
saved!!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela rolls over on the side of the
tracks, catches her breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as
the train roars past in a staccato blur.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 20 lanes bowling alley - day</strong>: Chaz’s taxi pulls
up, parks.</p>
<p><strong>taxi trunk</strong>: OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with
AIR INDIA. John starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells –</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: There are four bags. I have two hands. This
give you any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Make two trips?</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes bowling alley</strong>: Evening leagues are
going strong. John walks in, looks totally out of place. He moves down
the BALL RACK area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers,
finally stops at a pearl-white dazzler. He lifts it from the rack, steps
out into the prep area – in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13. John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles
right on the ball – “PROVISIONS DEPLETED.” He fluffs his trench coat
back, steps onto the polished wood with his well-traveled Oxfords. Young
bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity. An attractive
brunette is rather curious. John gives her a wink. Her boyfriend doesn’t
appreciate it. John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables.</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment</strong>: Seems small until you walk in
and realize it’s as long as a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed
at one end seem like it’s a mile away. Chaz throws the suitcases on it
as John arrives.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Simple question. How much longer do I have to
be your slave?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re not my slave, Chaz. You’re my very
appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with
the fat friend.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well I don’t know, what’s the going rate for
saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed
into the jaws of Hell?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: So what time you want me back?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to make an appearance at Midnite’s. Say
ten-ish?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Chaz…?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A little something from Delphi.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Gee, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: ‘Provisions depleted?’</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: I gave you three months worth. You were gone
only one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What can I say, Beeman, India was a real
drain.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: So what do you need?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Everything you got.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: You smell something, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe. Incubus in this girl I just exorcized
seemed a bit more spirited than usual.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Well, I’ve got your stone fragments from the
Road to Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea Scrolls – oh, you’ll love this
–</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Yeah, to you it’s nothing but to the Fallen
– like fingernails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is it with you and bugs?</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Gold was blessed by the Bishop Anicott
during the Crusades.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Watch it there.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Dragon’s breath.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I thought you couldn’t get it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Whoa, don’t want to get a flame near this.
Piece of the shroud Moses wore to the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got any callinicus?</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: How spirited was this incubus?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like it was trying to come right out through
the girl</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know how it sounds…</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: We’re finger puppets to them, John,
elaborate costumes – they can work us but don’t come through us. They
can’t. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Check the scrolls anyway. Corinthians. See if
there are any precedents.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Sure, John. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wouldn’t happen to have anything for –</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: On the house.</p>
<p><strong>ext. los angeles police department - day</strong>: Lots of
blue on blue in this parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>int. locker room</strong>: Locker door opens and Angela is
there, covered in the grime of the subway. She’s pained as she pulls off
her shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror. Tired, aging
eyes stare back.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Gutsy move out there, Dodson.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Gutsy? Well that’s a new one.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: You’re alive. Bad guy’s dead. No point in
using the other words.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Even though it was reckless – irresponsible –
stupid…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I knew you still cared.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: You’re good, Angela, real good but one of
these days…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I know, nobody’s luck lasts forever.</p>
<p><strong>ext. club midnite - 10 pm</strong>: So exclusive there’s not
even a line out front. Just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone
just for fun.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Chaz follows John from the cab to the
entrance. A Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front are
TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which is –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Two frogs on a bench.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Two frogs on a bench.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: What? But I’m with him! Right, John? John?</p>
<p><strong>int. club midnite</strong>: MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive
establishment. It’s a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated.
A retro speakeasy for the new millennium. John walks through a maze of
passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows.
He pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off
for several ladies. One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of
water. Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into RED WINE.
The ladies are very impressed, drink up. NICO, a young black man, walks
past John.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Neighborhood’s going to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway</strong>: John starts up a long flight of
stairs, stops in front of two very large doors.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Their surface is ancient, the wood
petrified over countless centuries. John places his fingers into the
gnarled folds, closes his eyes –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Numquam leadatur a morsu.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bastard changed the code again. Midnite! Come
on, do I have to huff and puff here?!</p>
<p><strong>int. midnite’s office</strong>: SWEEP ACROSS a
meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific sculpture that normally
displays our solar system in relative motion. But the planets here are
ancient RELICS with symbols and names – MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL,
ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center – “CREATOR.” This is an orrery
of the forces of the Universe. And it’s not moving.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam
laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Deciding which color to paint this place
again?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You’re back early.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got tired of spending your money.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: But I’m sure you spent enough.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well I do have a certain standard of
living.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Tell me you found it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I found the vault.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: That’s not what I asked.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, can I help it if Buddhist monks don’t
take bribes?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Second century depiction of a sephiroth in
the 4th realm…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. So we good here?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: It should counter the iconic plane –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That damn thing’s never going to balance.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John is somewhat intrigued until the
newest relic collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt.
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Must I remind you of what selling fake
relics will do to your health?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s authentic, Midnite, you just have the
wrong piece. Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? – I didn’t blink – that was a cough. You
never cough?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Better not be any Washingtons in here this
time.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Why did you cut your trip short?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know… Just a feeling –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Balthazar.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: We’re not still whining about Manhattan,
are we?</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: That expression alone has made my entire
night.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John takes several steps toward him.
Grins. Malevolent. There’s history here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll make your night – I’ll deport your sorry
ass right where you stand –</p>
<p><strong>john.</strong>: John stops in his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s bad enough that you let these half-breeds
in at all but this piece of shit –</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: Perks of becoming a primary investor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: Things change, balances shift. Get used
to it, Constantine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not while I’m still breathing –</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.</p>
<p><strong>ext. club midnite</strong>: John SLAMS out the exit –
coughing. He pulls the Vicks 44 from his jacket, struggles with the
child protector cap.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Hey, John.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John is surprised to see Hennessey
waiting. He chokes, is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle. Hennessey
grabs hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles the
syrup.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: I’m real sorry about this morning, John,
real sorry. Please don’t hate me for draggin’ you into that. Please
don’t…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: That’s good to hear. Real good…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But could you at least wait until I call for
you before you show up?</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: You didn’t call?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: So you want me to go away and come
back?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I’ve got an assignment for you.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Really? What kind of assignment?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The kind you’ll have to be sober for.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Oh God, you want me to surf the
ether.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, you know that exorcism wasn’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: I… I don’t have the Sight anymore.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t have it or don’t want to use it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just look around. A few days. You spot
anything unusual, anything – you let me know. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’ll be like old times.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Okay, okay… for you, John. Like old
times. Right.</p>
<p><strong>int. st. anthony’s church - confession booth -
night</strong>: Angela sits inside.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I killed a man today. Another one.</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: I’m sorry, Angela.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Most cops go twenty years without firing
their gun. Not me. I always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment building - series of shots - night</strong>:
Angela arrives home. Pours milk for a cat. Lets her hair down. Slips off
her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I didn’t even see his face. I just pulled
the trigger and he went away. Just like all the others…</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: These feelings are natural in your
line of work, Angela. I’d be worried if you didn’t have them.</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: But you have to be strong. You can’t
allow your faith to be overshadowed by guilt.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m trying real hard.</p>
<p><strong>int. ravenscar - night</strong>: Angela’s eyes open. An
Angela whose frightened features are dripping with a fever sweat. She’s
in a hospital gown, stares around a corner. Janitor polishes the floor
in the distance. A nurse checks off charts in the f.g. And right between
the two darts Angela, unseen by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - night</strong>: A metal fire door swings open
and Angela bursts out – breathing deep. She runs across the tar roof,
almost afraid to look back. She gets to the ledge, steps up. A BOTTLE in
the way fall – FOLLOW IT DOWN TO the –</p>
<p><strong>courtyard</strong>: – where it SHATTERS –</p>
<p><strong>int. ground floor hospital room</strong>: The sound has drawn
the attention of BARRY lying in bed. He moves up and stares out the
window – sees the broken glass in the courtyard. He scans up the
building and spots a FIGURE standing on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>rooftop - wider</strong>: Chilling April air flutters
Angela’s gown, vaporizes her breath. Tears stream down her cheeks as she
contemplates the unthinkable. Cityscape of lights are spread out below
but Angela is seeing something else.</p>
<p><strong>reflected in her eyes –</strong>: is a city engulfed in RED
FLAMES. Follow that tear with the same reflection of fire inside as it
traces her cheek and slips into her mouth. ANGELA shudders, rubs her
wrist where we see the skin has swelled and reddened just like the
Prisoner’s. And there’s that same circular symbol in the flesh. She
wipes her tears – tries to be strong. Takes a few breaths for courage,
them simply steps off.</p>
<p><strong>int. barry’s room</strong>: BARRY’S WIDE EYES follow her
down.</p>
<p><strong>ext. courtyard - later</strong>: Barry approaches across the
barren courtyard, leans down to Angela’s contorted body. But she’s still
alive. Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches out,
touches her face. Eyes close. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>int. angela’s apartment</strong>: Angela stirs awake.
Disturbed. OVER this we hear INCESSANT COUGHING –</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - bathroom</strong>: John switches on
the light, leans up from the sink and wipes his mouth with a towel. It’s
covered with blood. More runs down the drain. He stares at himself in
the mirror. ON John’s worried eyes –</p>
<p><strong>angle - angela’s eyes</strong>: looking equally
distraught.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: It’s her, Angela…</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several
officers and medical personnel.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: It’s Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She… she fell from the roof?</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: No. She jumped.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: I know it’s hard to accept but –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Isabel would never in a million years take
her own life. Never.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Angela… there was a surveillance camera on
the roof.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: John marches down a hallway,
his trench coat a step behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist,
coughs. Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers. John stops at a
doctor’s office door – hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>int. ravenscar - surveillance footage</strong>: View of the
rooftop. There’s Isabel in her nightgown, stepping up – pausing just a
second. Then one step and she’s gone. So clear. So unrefutable.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on
her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Take some time…</p>
<p><strong>int. doctor’s office</strong>: A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES
illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A DARK sinister splotch snakes through
both LUNGS. John stands there, stares at this wall of death with
disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No – I’ve beaten things, insurmountable
things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that
you think I’m going to be done in by THIS?</p>
<p><strong>dr. archer</strong>: You wouldn’t be the first, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It can’t be that simple. I mean come on, Les,
you saved me before. You can do it again, right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. archer</strong>: This is different. This is
aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>dr. archer</strong>: Twenty years ago you didn’t want to be
here. Now you don’t want to leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s because I know exactly where I’m going
this time.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway</strong>: John steps outside of the Doctor’s
office, pauses to gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here
fast.</p>
<p><strong>int. ravenscar - hallway</strong>: Angela is on the move.
Emotions are coming in strong. She can’t get out of here fast enough.
She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered one.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wait, hold the door!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Going down?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not if I can help it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. somewhere in istanbul - day</strong>: A PICKUP TRUCK
crosses a barren landscape. In the back bed are several goats and one
Prisoner. He grips the relic tight in one hand. That anxious fever has
returned. Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in
the distance – dart back to the road they’re on – heading the opposite
way. Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic tighter. Eyes
snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through the center window,
leans in and grabs the Driver – jerks his head back against the bulkhead
– cracking it in the process. Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes
control. He swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over as
driver. Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and into
the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising airliners in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. l.a. apartment - day</strong>: Close to condemned
status. SCAN UP floor after floor, COMING TO REST ON a window covered
with aluminum foil.</p>
<p><strong>int. hennessey’s apartment</strong>: Every wall of this tiny
shithole is covered in aluminum foil. A sober Hennessey stands
surrounded by decades of newspapers and periodicals – tries to get his
breathing in check. He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the
amulet but it’s not there. Oh yeah – in the pocket. Decision made, he
reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the walls and the window.</p>
<p><strong>ext. echo park - day</strong>: John sits at a park bench.
Motionless. Taking in the world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows
drifting across the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars. John just
sits there, HEARING every breath he takes, wondering which one will be
his last.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Lung cancer? Lung cancer?!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s funny as shit, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: As if you guys didn’t have something to do
with it…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hey, I think you brought this one on
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Now why wouldn’t you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know, something in the air –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t worry, John, you’ll beat this. You beat
everything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not this time, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh wow, you’re serious… No wonder the Boss is
in such a good mood.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him
for me. You know…?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an
odd SOUND as she does.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe you but to
even ASK that? All those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp –
his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks. He’s going to take all
that out on you, John, and he’s going to enjoy ripping your soul to
shreds until the end of time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So I take that as a ‘no?’</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re the one soul the man himself would
actually come up here to collect. And you know how much he despises this
place.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m starting to see his point.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Have you gone to see the Snob?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Look, don’t let your ego get in the way on
this. I’d miss having someone up here I can… relate to.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. chaz’s taxi - day</strong>: Seen through a mild
rain is the Theological Society building, a foreboding structure that
looks out of place for this city. John stares out the back seat window,
takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to Chaz –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sure I can get you in here.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Pass.</p>
<p><strong>int. theological society - later</strong>: A few bishops talk
quietly. A cardinal studies Scriptures. Definitely not the place for
atheists. John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the –</p>
<p><strong>library</strong>: John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen
standing in front of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class
wrapped in Armani’s best. The other is Father Garret. John stands to the
side and waits for their conversation to end. An ATTENDANT makes the
rounds.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Can I take your coat,
Mr. Constantine?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No thanks, I’m not staying long.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: How about you, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m not staying long either.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: My business with him is urgent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: First come, first served.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So you’re rude no matter where you are.</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: and Angela have retreated to another
area for privacy.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why is he stalling on this? My sister needs
a Catholic funeral.</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: Angela, it’s still considered a
mortal sin –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She didn’t commit suicide.</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: The Bishop has read otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Father… David – this is Isabel. Please…</p>
<p><strong>father garret</strong>: I’ll talk to him again.</p>
<p><strong>by the fireplace</strong>: Gabriel sits in his chair, watches
the fire with unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings. The ghostly
image is visible for only a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I know what you want, son.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John sits across from him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have
you?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I could offer how a shepherd leads even the
most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you’re going to make me beg?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It wouldn’t help. You’ve already wasted
your chance at redemption.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about the minions I’ve sent back, the
souls that I’ve saved – that should guarantee my passage across –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – No – passage requires faith and faith by
definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means
you’re not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has
mostly been for selfish reasons. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is bullshit – bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s like you’ve got some cosmic scale
weighing everything we do – help an old lady across the street – put in
a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime – you’re fucking nickel and diming
us to death down here!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John jumps up, leans into his face.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And you know what, you’re the ones with the
problem, not us – You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up,
who goes down and you don’t even understand us –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Each of you is born with the promise of
salvation preordained. The cost of your redemption is simple belief. And
yet you whine about impossible rules. Sometimes I imagine you hardly
deserve the gift you have been given.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gift?! More like a curse the way you manage
things.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I am taking your situation into account,
John, but don’t push me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why me, Gabriel? It’s personal, isn’t it? I
didn’t go to church enough? I didn’t pray enough? I was five bucks short
in the collection plate? Why?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’re going to die because you smoked 30
cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you’re going to Hell because of
the life you took. Or to put it in a way that your kind would
understand. You’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>ext. theological society - minutes later</strong>: Angela
stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour. She hears a cough, looks
over to see John standing on the other side, looking equally frayed.
They share another glance.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John fishes a pack of cigarettes from
his pocket. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He has a rotten sense of humor. And his punch
lines are killers.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: John? It’s raining! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>int. hennessey’s apartment - a cigarette pack</strong>: lies
on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and stacks of
newspapers. Hennessey sits amongst the garbage, slumped over. But he’s
not sleeping. He’s surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to guide
him. His hands move down and across the stacks of newer periodicals,
fingers probing the layers of information. Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey’s eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals on top of
his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers away and sees an OBITUARY.
A name – Isabel Dodson.</p>
<p><strong>ext. l.a. streets - evening</strong>: John walks the streets,
numb to the world. A rat scurries past near the curb. Then another.
Several crows fly by. Above him is a BILLBOARD - “YOUR TIME IS RUNNING
OUT.” Doesn’t matter that below it is – “TO BUY A NEW CHEVY.” The point
is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks out laughing which
quickly turns into a coughing fit. He leans to a gutter. Another rat
scoots past. John barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it’s the
crab crawling by that finally catches John’s gaze.</p>
<p><strong>voice of man</strong>: Hey, buddy, you got a light?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: We gotta stick together, right?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The entire mess collapses to the ground
in a flood of scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as they
scatter into the city. John stands there, shocked and concerned. What
the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>int. angela’s apartment - day</strong>: That surveillance
VIDEO FOOTAGE from Ravenscar plays again. There’s Isabel in her
nightgown walking across the roof. Spread out on a cluttered coffee
table is Isabel’s case file. CORONER’S REPORT is opened. Let’s see “NO
DRUGS IN SYSTEM” and the biggie – “Cause of Death – SUICIDE.” Angela
sits on the couch in her robe. Disheveled and distraught. She’s taking
this hard.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m sorry, Isabel…</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Constantine.</p>
<p><strong>int. midnite’s office</strong>: John paces as Midnite works
on that Universal orrery, adjusting components but balance continues to
elude him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A few months, maybe a year. That’s it. End of
story. Game over.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, don’t break down on my account.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: What do you want from me? A shoulder to cry
on?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This bastard attacked me right out in the open
– on Sepulveda no less.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: They don’t like you, John. You’ve deported
how many back to Hell?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s just it – this wasn’t some possession
or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our
plane.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You must have just crossed over and didn’t
even realize it –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t cross over – It was on this side.
Here.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: – it’s wet out, you’re wandering around
aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Emotional?!</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Okay, so you saw something. We’ve seen a
few small ones slip through now and then.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s more than that… first the girl, then
this.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: John, you know my connections. Any shifts
or tremors in the planes and I’d hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Something’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>int. lapd office - later</strong>: The name JOHN CONSTANTINE
is center screen on a monitor – typed into the police station’s SEARCH
ENGINE. Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking across the
windows. Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors scroll
under John’s name. Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several
SPEEDING tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John’s license
has been REVOKED. But it’s the other incidents that draw Angela in.</p>
<p><strong>brief closeups</strong>: Of specific words in a few HEADLINES
– “Occult activity on the rise…” “Claimed possession is refuted by
Bishop…” “Satanic cult dissolved…” Accompanies with an assortment of
unusual case photos. – BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL – Odd SYMBOLS burned
into a ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp. – JOHN in handcuffs looking
back at a mother holding her son in her arms. A younger and more noble
Father Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Another line – “INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to
PROSECUTE.” Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made waves
– LONDON – PARIS – ROME – BUDAPEST – MOSCOW. Stops on the one that
matters – LOS ANGELES. And there’s an address. Angela hits PRINT and the
HP HUMS away. A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees
she’s the only one here. She gets up, answers it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: L.A.P.D. This is Dodson, hello?</p>
<p><strong>int. istanbul airport - day</strong>: A police guard scans
passengers and a printout of the Prisoner. He walks past a man standing
in the metal detector line. This is actually the Prisoner wearing the
clothes and glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the lapel?
Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the iron relic in
a bag he took from the truck driver. He has no choice but to place it on
the conveyer belt.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious pov</strong>: Watching the Prisoner. He looks back
AT us, suspicious. Nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: looks back nervously, as his bag goes
through the detector.</p>
<p><strong>detector screen</strong>: shows the folds of the bag, a
wallet, a passport and nothing else. The iron relic doesn’t even produce
an outline. Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can’t believe his luck,
grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.</p>
<p><strong>ext. los angeles - night</strong>: VARIOUS of the city – the
contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious.
That abandoned mission behind Bob’s Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged
between competing banks.</p>
<p><strong>come to rest on –</strong>: The towering statue of The Good
Shepherd. His hands are welcoming us into the “HOLY CROSS CEMETERY.”
Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley.</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes - the bar</strong>: John drinks alone. Pissed
at life. At death. That small black box of his lies on the table
unopened. Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass, traps
it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette, tips the glass and
blows smoke inside. Spider can’t escape the poison air, bumps the glass.
Trapped. Dying.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Welcome to my life.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Mr. Constantine?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I saw you at –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – I remember.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: And –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She did make an impression.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’d like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not really in the talking mood right
now.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Could you just listen then?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Always a catch…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: My sister was murdered last week.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry to hear…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Her name was Isabel. Isabel Dodson?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You don’t remember her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Never met her.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She look anything like you? I would’ve
remembered.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She was a patient at Ravenscar. Then last
Tuesday she just decided to step off the roof.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I thought you said she was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Isabel would never take her own life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’d be surprised at what people will do.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Look, I know I’m not making much sense –
hell I’m not really sure what I’m doing here… I just feel – the circles
you travel in – the occult, demonology, exorcisms…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I believe someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine, brainwashed her into stepping off that roof. Some kind
of legion or cult.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sounds like a theory. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Well I thought with your background and
experience, you could at least point me in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: My sister always talked about a world better
than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn’t afraid of dying because
she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if
she had really taken her own life –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – she would have committed a mortal sin and
her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love
or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her
apart over and over for the rest of eternity. That about right?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’re not the only one afraid of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>ext. 20 lanes bowling alley - night</strong>: Cars are lined
all the way down the street. Angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of
the shadow following her. It’s joined by another in the trees – both
closing in with each step.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Detective!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How open is your mind?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She doesn’t answer, continues walking.
What she doesn’t see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? How about
what comes out of each?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You mean like angels?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And demons.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See, you don’t have the mindset for this kind
of work.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Look, I see terrible things every day. A
mother drowns her baby. A ten-year-old shoots his father. But it’s not
demons, it’s the evil that men do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re right, we’re capable of terrible things
but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and
jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then sometimes, something comes along and
gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the
kick of it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I don’t believe in demons.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You should. They believe in us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We should go…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fast.</p>
<p><strong>ext. holy cross cemetery</strong>: They make it through the
gate, pass through an alley of overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES
through the branches – flitters right past Angela’s face. She swats at
it, manages to get a branch across the cheek. They near the Good
Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER, fade out. Statues of saints become
dark monoliths. John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a
mausoleum. A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of blood. Now she
hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding
them.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John is just as surprised he’s saying
this –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wings.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wings?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And maybe talons.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Are you kidding? Of what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Something that’s not supposed to be here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and
DEMONS SHRIEK as they are instantly vaporized. John tucks his burning
hand into a coat pocket, extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a
rubbery stain left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ‘I accidentally crossed over?’ I don’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What was that? I saw wings – and teeth –
they were flying. What the hell were those things?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They weren’t angels.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Seplavites, actually. Scavengers for the
damned. Demons?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What? You can’t be serious… this is
impossible…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah… And I don’t think they were after
me…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You really believe she wouldn’t commit
suicide?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: My sister? Never in a million years.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s be sure.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Simple. See if she’s in Hell.</p>
<p><strong>ext. l.a. county morgue - night</strong>: Not exactly an
inviting place. Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.</p>
<p><strong>int. angela’s apartment - night</strong>: John stares at a
photo of Angela and her father in police uniform. Obviously happier
times. Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box. That
gray cat follows close to her heels.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: These are all Isabel’s things.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The cat too?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Yeah, why…?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Don’t you need candles and a pentagram for
this to work?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why, do you have any?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need you to step outside now.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela wants to stay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Angela? Please.</p>
<p><strong>apartment in hell</strong>: Same layout, different decorator.
John takes a deep, raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall
behind him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed structure
in Beirut. Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape
but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not quite night. John steps over
the crumbling wall into –</p>
<p><strong>ext. hell los angeles</strong>: John walks out onto the top
overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks
of long- forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is she here?!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John cautiously steps closer to the
railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They’re
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking down in silence,
faces numb with sorrow and grief.</p>
<p><strong>is she here?!</strong>: That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and
John now spots a huge blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the
cityscape, rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this isn’t a
safe place for the living.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a simple question! Is she here or
not?!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Isabel?</p>
<p><strong>int. angela’s apartment - hallway</strong>: In that same
motion we left her in – Angela finishes pushing the door closed. As it
LATCHES –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Angela… come back in…</p>
<p><strong>int. living room</strong>: John sits slumped in the chair,
drained. Steam rises off his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket
has almost all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens
his palm – reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name “ISABEL
DODSON” is typed on it. Even as a semi-convert, this news completely
floors Angela. She takes the plastic band – grips it tight – tries to
hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain overwhelm. Her knee
buckle and she drops to the floor. John watches, isn’t sure how to help.
He finally reaches out a single hand – slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and Angela falls right
into his arms. John hasn’t been this close to anyone in a long time.
Angela finally composes herself.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: How? How did you do this…?</p>
<p><strong>int. l.a. county morgue - night</strong>: Body drawer slides
open – reveals Isabel. Lying in a cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of
a different type. Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he’s still alone. He reaches in, rips open the
protective plastic and lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her
forehead. Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last. Hennessey
shudders. This is it. He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void
–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When I was a kid, I saw things…</p>
<p><strong>flashback - ext. street - day</strong>: A TEN-YEAR-OLD John
comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at
a mailbox.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Things I wasn’t supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>int. diner - night</strong>: John looks up at the
Waitress.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tea.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a
priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was
eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The last place they put me was run by a
church…</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. mental institution - hallway</strong>: The
Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The revered Father made the brilliant
deduction that I was possessed, said I needed to be exorcised…</p>
<p><strong>int. room - high angle</strong>: The Doctor runs in. Sees the
revered Father below, leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is
held down by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams at them
all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was like someone trying to pull teeth that
weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>int. diner - john</strong>: Present-day John does the same,
remembering the pain.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So I took things into my own hands and I found
a way out.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You attempted suicide.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I never attempt anything.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - teenage john</strong>: kneeling with a pair off
scissors. He’s inside a…</p>
<p><strong>int. classroom</strong>: Teenage John looks up at a room
filled with people from all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers,
garbage men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in school
chairs and wait for John to do the deed. He puts the blade to his wrist
– one swipe and the world around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR
–</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But you’re still here. Alive.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not my doing.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - teenage john</strong>: as he’s jolted by DEFIB
PADS. He’s in the back of a…</p>
<p><strong>int. ambulance - moving</strong>: Paramedics are soaked in
sweat. One looks a bit like a young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT
LINE. There’s little hope.</p>
<p><strong>ext. los angeles</strong>: The ambulance moves through a city
that is transforming. From this world’s Los Angeles to a barren Hell
version.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Officially I was dead for seven minutes. But
believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>int. ambulance</strong>: FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly
SPIKES with a pulse –</p>
<p><strong>int. morgue</strong>: Hennessey’s hand jerks back from the
plastic. His eyes fix on Isabel’s wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is
back. Hennessey’s unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed. He rushes
out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming in.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey, what’re you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When I returned I didn’t just see demons
anymore, I could do the one thing they couldn’t – come and go as I
please.</p>
<p><strong>ext. morgue - hennessey</strong>: runs as fast as a very
obese man can – aiming for that PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the
receiver, punches numbers as fast as he can. RING – RING –</p>
<p><strong>hennessey</strong>: Be there, John… please…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Heaven and Hell are right here, behind every
wall, every face – the world behind the world. It’s crossing over that’s
the real trick. That’s why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But
even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>int. late night restaurant</strong>: HENNESSEY barges in,
squeezes past the MAITRE D’.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Sir, you need a reservation!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But the worst demons are the ones that are
allowed to be here – the ones that are half-human so they blend in…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … just like those with the angel’s touch
living alongside of us. The half-breeds.</p>
<p><strong>alternate los angeles</strong>: An incredible pristine lake
reflecting a city of light.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar’s
eyes. Bitter enemies. Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his
fingers. He leaves out the back exit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They call it ‘the Balance.’ I call it
hypocritical bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So when one of them gets a little cocky,
peddles their influence or hijacks a soul – I deport their scaly ass
right back to Hell. I don’t get them all but maybe enough to insure my
retirement.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Sounds like you’re trying to buy your way
into Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, what would you do if you were sentenced
to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why you? I mean many go to Hell, why were
you able to escape?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: God has a plan for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Isabel saw things too.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Detective Dodson here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. restaurant - later</strong>: The morgue is seen across
the street. The Guard that chased Hennessey is just outside.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Security Guard spotted him near the body,
chased him out.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: He comes over here, makes a run at the entire
menu and pow – deflates like a fricken Macy’s day balloon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit… Why didn’t you call me, you fat sonna
bitch…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Rest in peace, Father.</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes - behind the lanes</strong>: With a loud crowd
and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY the noise back here is DEAFENING.
But this is Beeman’s home. See the desk, the TV. The fold-away bed.
Beeman is on the phone. There’s a conversation but it’s way too noisy to
hear. All we see are the emotions on Beeman’s face. No doubt news of
Hennessey’s death is one of the biggies. Beeman quickly reaches for a
marker, puts it to paper and starts drawing – listening and drawing –
He’s finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That cabinet with the
ancient books now gets his attention.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to see where Isabel died.</p>
<p><strong>ext. east la - night</strong>: Graffiti-adorned walls give
way to a tall iron fence, heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the
six-story hospital complex of RAVENSCAR.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But
this one isn’t wearing a hospital gown, he’s wearing a trench coat.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Seances, crystals – channeling… Our father
thought she was just trying to get attention. She certainly did
that.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop</strong>: Angela stands behind John. A large
water tank is anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She’d tell everyone about things she said
she saw. Crazy things. Things that hadn’t happened yet. She’d scare my
mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the
world. Then one day she just stopped… never said another word.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you put her in here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Show me her room.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor</strong>: John and Angela head toward Isabel’s
room. A NURSE appears from around the corner walking with a boy. It’s
Barry, the boy in the courtyard. He locks on Angela and when she makes
eye contact he breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms
outstretched.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Barry!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She rushes in, gently tugs the boy
away.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No, Barry, that’s not Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry. They were friends. He kind of had
a crush on your sister.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You were twins.</p>
<p><strong>int. isabel’s room</strong>: John steps inside, gives the
sterile room a thorough scan.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So how long?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Two months. This time.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I already did all that.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Now you’re insulting me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t walk off a building without leaving
something behind.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You saw everything she left behind. In that
box.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe she left something else. Something more
personal. Just for you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You were her twin, Angela. Twins tend to think
alike.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m not like my sister.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But you were at once time. When you were kids.
When you’d spend every waking hour with each other. You’d start a
sentence, she’d finish it. You’d get hurt, she’d cry.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: That was a long time ago…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That kind of bond doesn’t just disappear.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She planned her death in this room, she
thought it up right where you’re standing –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She knew you’d come – She counted on you to
see what she saw, to feel what she felt – to do what she did. What did
she do, Angela?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What did she do, Angela?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What would you leave her? What would it be?
Where would it be?! Where would it be?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: The tree.</p>
<p><strong>ext. courtyard - night</strong>: A lone tree stands in the
center of the lit courtyard. John and Angela approach it. Examine it.
Nothing. John drops lower on the tree, to a child’s height. Finally sees
something near the ground, gestures to Angela. She kneels down next to
him, sees what he sees. That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into
his hand. But this time there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There must have been a tree in our backyard…
when we were kids…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Cor?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Corinthians.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There is no 14h act in Corinthians.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need a church.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital chapel - minutes later</strong>: Several
families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor comforts a man and wife. John
and Angela slip through, head for the shelves of reference books on the
back wall. They whisper.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of
Ethenius. It’s like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different
view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the
hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There’s a difference?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Depends on which side of the fence you’re
standing.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So why haven’t I seen this book before?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because it doesn’t exist here on this
side.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What do you mean –</p>
<p><strong>same chapel - hell</strong>: The epitome of blasphemy – A
church in Hell. Only they don’t worship God in here. And that’s not
Christ on the cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate
black. John is now facing books with completely different markings. He
searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow
down the walls, getting closer to John with each heartbeat. He finds the
book, steps back as he closes his eyes –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: – not here on this side?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Where did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: 13:29. 13:30 – Here… Corinthians 14:01… ‘The
sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son.’</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Whose son?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Symbol isn’t a demon’s… that’s why I couldn’t
place it… not a normal possession…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But he can’t cross over – impossible for the
son to cross over…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Whose son? God’s?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. The other one. Lucifer had a son too.</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes - behind the lanes</strong>: Beeman sits under
the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow alley of machines stretches out
behind him. He stares into the scrolls – an ancient book with a single
page folded a thousand times. Turns another page.</p>
<p><strong>bowling area</strong>: Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley
is when it’s closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the
unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>behind the lanes</strong>: Beeman has stopped turning pages.
That’s because he’s now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below
are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body. But it’s
what’s above the beast that is most troubling. A figure on a cross – his
arms outstretched – seemingly welcoming the beast into this world.</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: This is not good…</p>
<p><strong>beeman</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>ext. la streets - night</strong>: Angela’s SUV races quickly
through traffic while John gets her up to speed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The myth says Mammon was conceived before his
father’s fall from grace but was born after.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But unlike his old man, he’s never been in the
presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either.
That goes double for us – God’s most prized creations. Mammon would be
the last demon we’d ever want crossing over.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But demons can’t come and go, that’s what
you said.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Unless they found a bridge. Some psychic with
the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand
whatever shit she’d pull out.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Isabel…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But even a bridge wouldn’t help Mammon.
Because to cross over, the myth says he’d still need the one thing he
could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Impossible? Sure it’s impossible. That’s what
makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find
the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn’t on
our side.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John sits back, gut churning. Angela’s
in detective mode.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She knew. That’s why she killed herself. But
it doesn’t make sense…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Makes sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John, she sacrificed herself to beat
him.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why is she in Hell?</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes bowling alley</strong>: Something small and
SHINY is rolling down the alley. It lands in the trough, spins round and
round – Beeman leans out to try and see what it is. The silver object
keeps spinning. He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face. Then
another. Book on his desk ignites in flame.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 20 lanes - night</strong>: SUV pulls into the empty
parking lot. John is out before Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side
door. A few flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John rushes
in.</p>
<p><strong>int. 20 lanes bowling alley</strong>: Only a LOW HUM pervades
the dead stillness of the alley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Beeman?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Maybe he’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s always here.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus, no –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh God –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit – reveal
yourself! I summon you!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela steps back in awe as the air
around his outstretched arms begins to WARP – to tear a faint hole from
the bowling alley right into another world right here – darker – Hellish
–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Into the light I command thee!! Into the light
I –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … this is my fault… I sent them in… I sent
them right to their deaths… a damn one-man plague.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John, you need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve seen a goddamn doctor!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get away from me!!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stay the hell away – Please –</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. john’s apartment - night</strong>: John sits in his
opened window, simmering. He holds a lit cigarette but doesn’t dare put
it to his lips. Outside the city goes about its unending churn.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Down on the street are several police
vehicles. ENGINES START and they drive away. Swirl of blue and red
lights flash across John’s moist eyes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There were no trees in our back yard.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But you knew that already, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You see something in me… Something Isabel
had.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go home, Angela.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I need to understand –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because you open up to that world, you’re
inviting whatever’s out there back in. That’s what happened to
Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m not Isabel.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, she embraced her gift while you denied
yours and that denial is exactly why you’re still alive. Stick with me,
that’ll change.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And I don’t need another ghost following me
around.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Dammit, John – they killed my sister!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I can’t let them get away with that. Even if
it means going down the same path she did. Now if you won’t help me get
there, I’ll find my own way. But I won’t run. Never.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You do this, there’s no turning back. You see
them – they see you. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - later</strong>: Pushing slowly
through a lifeless apartment – drawing closer to the opened bathroom
door. WATER is pouring.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Do I take off my clothes or leave them on?
John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On is fine.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom</strong>: John fills a 70-year-old porcelain
BATHTUB. Angela stands in the center.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why water?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s the universal conduit. Lubricates the
transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there’s water in
Hell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Normally only a portion of the body has to be
suspended but you wanted the crash course…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What will I see?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lie down.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Lie down?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have to be fully submerged.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: As long as it takes. Here –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Last chance… Take a deep one.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela takes a deep breath, holds it.
John pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted
on his the entire time.</p>
<p><strong>angela’s pov</strong>: A silent John ripples above. His hand
grips her arm, skin to skin.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Angela lies there and panic sets in.
She starts to surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom, holds
it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out. She can’t hold her
breath much longer. It’s not working – But the room’s lighting begins to
pulsate – as if the current were ramping down. It slows to that dim
half- light as – JOHN’S EYES – CLOSE. A single blink. ANGELA is lying in
now BOILING WATER, screaming for all of her life. Water muffles the
sound but not the fury. Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard – snapping out of the
hold down bolts. John is stunned – how powerful is this woman? Another
SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS. Water starts streaming onto the
tile. John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the water – her
muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her mouth breaks the surface. She
SLAMS hard against his chest – arms wrapping tight – fingers digging
into his back – leaving marks that might just scar. TUB GIVES WAY and
the damn breaks. John and Angela go down – hit the tile as one – water
washing over them both. ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling. She
looks up him, eyes filled with revelation.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: All those people… so sad…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: … I’ve always known… where the bad guys are…
where to aim, when to duck… it’s not luck… I’ve always known…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Angela?</p>
<p><strong>int. behind the alley</strong>: Angela runs behind the
vertebrae of machines, dripping water the entire way. John tries to keep
up.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It was rolling toward him – not a ball –
something smaller. Shiny.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Balthazar.</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - later</strong>: Beeman’s bowling bag
is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and
bullets go everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets. Those
brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.</p>
<p><strong>christian relics</strong>: are removed from a display
cabinet. There’s the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the petrified husk
from the River of Life – the hollow shaft of an iron cross – all
striking pieces individually but when twisted and locked together form a
very imposing –</p>
<p><strong>– holy shotgun.</strong>: He swings the cross down, pours a
pound of blasting powder into the husk – chambers a special bullet into
one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut – turns and FIRES. BULLET leaves a
trail of flame as it streaks across his endless apartment, blasts the
center out of – A carton of Lucky Strikes. SETTLE ON the Surgeon
General’s warning – burning away.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Can you kill him? What about the
Balance?</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - later</strong>: John is stuffing the
bowling bag while Angela watches, now dressed in dry clothes. That shirt
is John’s.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That half-breed tipped my scales when he
started killing my friends. I’m just adding a little counterweight.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What about me? I can’t stay here
forever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Think of it as a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re staying in the car.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. 20 lanes - dawn</strong>: FAT-ASS TIRES BURN under
the full torque of a 426 HEMI. A jet-black ’70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from
the basement garage of 20 Lanes – slides onto the streets of L.A. Angela
hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob – slams into 2nd – leaves
another layer of tread behind.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ocean</strong>: FLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT
OVER US. Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a sprawling
metropolis stretched out miles below.</p>
<p><strong>l.a. landmarks - dawn</strong>: streak PAST. The Big Donut,
the occult bookstores, the ’57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John’s Barracuda. He downshifts – DRIFTS
PAST a building with a facade of pre-stressed concrete and huge gold
letters – “BZR</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This shouldn’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>int. bzr brokerage</strong>: Elevator opens and John steps
out into a lobby of concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams
money. Lots of it. Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty. Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open.
John looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick DOOR glides
closed, seals with another HISS. No way in. John notices the janitor
down one hallway. It’s Nico from Midnite’s. He and John lock stares.
Nico opens a “Security Only” door, steps inside – leaves the door
open.</p>
<p><strong>int. trading room</strong>: Monitors are powering up around
the room. A few of those Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite’s are
here.</p>
<p><strong>young turk</strong>: Hey, early bird is a fat bird, know what
I’m sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>pretty boy</strong>: What are we pushing today, sir?</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: Phillip Morris.</p>
<p><strong>booom –</strong>: One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front
edge of a FIREBALL – sending Balthazar flying with glass and flame. John
stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL – that Dragon’s breath
flamethrower now duct-taped to his holy shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How’s he doing it?</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: This is in direct violation of the
Balance!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Screw the Balance.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Balthazar’s young turks attack. One
leaps over the trading station. John swings around – aims the SHOTGUN –
BOOM – half-breed is blasted midair. The other turk seems to defy
gravity as he scampers across the ceiling. John aims up – PUMPS SEVERAL
ROUNDS – steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a desk. BOOM
– BOOM – that’ll keep it down.</p>
<p><strong>int. barracuda</strong>: Angela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop
instinct takes over and she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet.
Intact.</p>
<p><strong>int. bzr trading room</strong>: John turns his attention back
to Balthazar, doesn’t hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of
flame. Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else
underneath. The true form.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How’s he doing it, you half-breed shit?!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He leans up, winded. Watches in delight
as Balthazar strains to take his final breaths.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: I will see you very soon…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: You can’t cheat it this time… you’re
going back to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: True. But you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m reading you your last rites.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: Your remedial incantations have no
relevance to my kind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aren’t you half human?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You see, that makes you eligible to be
forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed
into the kingdom of God?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A demon in heaven – love to be a fly on that
wall…</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: You’re not a priest, you have no
power…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: – I escaped hell, who else do you know that
has the power to do that?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and
you can go back to your shithole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ‘May the merciful God have mercy on you and
grant you the pardon of all your sins…’</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ‘Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are
remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from –’</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: – It may not even work…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How? How’s he doing it?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ‘Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in
the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Gh –’</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: … Sangre de dio.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: What killed the Son of God will give
birth to the son of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s found the Spear.</p>
<p><strong>close on the prisoner’s relic</strong>: It’s tucked between
the folds of an AIRLINES blanket.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve been
cleared for landing. Please make sure your seats are in their upright
and locked position.</p>
<p><strong>int. 747 - mid-flight</strong>: Prisoner in an aisle seat,
trying to keep calm. He looks behind him as if being watched. Just
nerves again.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: We should be on the ground in Los
Angeles within ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bzr brokerage - front area</strong>: ANGELA moves
through the gathered crowd looking up at the building. As she makes her
way through, the amulet brushes against bodies – swinging from side to
side. Angela suddenly stops in the center of the street, turns…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Something’s coming…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela spins, spots John’s BARRACUDA
exploding around the corner. It barrels up the street and slides to a
SQUEALING stop in front of her. Passenger door swings open.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened to staying in the car?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You were in danger.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well now there’s a premonition.</p>
<p><strong>int. bzr</strong>: Balthazar is taking his last breaths when
the sound of WIND filters through the room. He looks up as a shadow
drapes across him. Eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>balthazar</strong>: One more chance…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus didn’t die from being nailed to a
cross.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. barracuda - moving</strong>: John takes a turn at
70 as Angela stares into John’s Bible.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He was finished off by a soldier’s spear.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m Catholic, John – I know the crucifixion
story.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then you know what this spear would mean to a
demon trying to cross over.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The stains on its edges?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mammon needed divine assistance – how’s the
blood of God’s only son?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So that’s it – he’s got everything he needs
to escape…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not quite. Twins.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here we go –</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A hound on the hunt.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hang on –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela looks back, sees their pursuer
enter the alley. It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all
manner of physics.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I lost it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: He’s down –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not down. Gimme your phone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown</strong>: A BRITISH COUPLE sit in the back of
Chaz’s taxi, staring out at the seedy side of town as if it were “Wild
Kingdom.”</p>
<p><strong>british man</strong>: They mark their territory with graffiti
instead of urine but they’re still very much animals.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: This is a private line – John?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Chaz – where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Ah… 3rd and Figueroa.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You still got that Sedrallus?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Yeah, but I’m kind of busy right now,
John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dammit, Chaz, I’m trying to save my ass
here!</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: What else is new…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Remember the Chalic of Enook incident?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this
car!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … 2 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: I’m five blocks away! John? John?! Ah…
shit.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Sorry, tour’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ext. la streets - continuous action</strong>: John heads
toward the skyline now – at 90 mph – to the 3rd Street Bridge on the
horizon. Angela scans behind them, can’t believe her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: He’s back.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: John, he’s back and he’s gaining!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course he’s gaining.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 3rd street bridge</strong>: Chaz swerves onto the other
side of the narrow bridge. He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway –
opens the glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a glass
vial out of it. Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps
out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears the sound of a
STRAINING ENGINE. Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge’s
arched roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Shit – shit – shit –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Chaz twists off the gas cap, drops the
vial into the tank. He pulls out his BEEPER, rips the cover off,
exposing the electronics. He wedges the beeper into the tank inlet, then
starts sprinting off the bridge while –</p>
<p><strong>int. barracuda</strong>: John gives Angela the number.</p>
<p><strong>int. gas tank</strong>: BEEPER CONTACTS BUZZ – spark – GAS
IGNITES –</p>
<p><strong>taxi</strong>: EXPLODES right under Balthazar in a tremendous
FIREBALL. Initial impact only kicks him higher. It’s when the Sedrallus
in the tank truly ignites that the real FIREWORKS begin.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Balthazar is caught in a haze of
brilliant red particles that tear his body apart in midair. His final
SHRIEK is chilling.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. barracuda</strong>: John smacks the wheel,
victoriously – looks over to Angela who sighs with relief. His
expression changes as he centers on the empty necklace dangling around
her neck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s the amulet?</p>
<p><strong>angela!!</strong>: John SLAMS the BRAKES home – car spins and
John is already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs to the
rail.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: What the hell was that?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re even.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Even?</p>
<p><strong>ext. lax - day</strong>: Prisoner walks out of the terminal,
here at last. He stares at all the vehicles at his disposal. A family
crowds around the back of a minivan. Wife hugs the dad.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious pov</strong>: Watches him from behind. Prisoner
turns, looks back, suspiciously. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: walks out to the street, slides into the
minivan, tears away. Kids’ toys tumble across the seats.</p>
<p><strong>int. club midnite - hallway - continuous action</strong>:
John bursts through a door – Midnite right on his heels.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Mammon has been trying to climb out of his
father’s shadow for eons.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And this time he might just make it.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Because he’s got the Spear?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You’re giving this girl way too much
credit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t know her.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: And you do? That would be a first.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s the chair?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: The chair?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The delicate little number from Sing Sing?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Midnite just stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: It’s a fine line that separates a hero from
a fool.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: And taint my establishment with your blood?
I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Midnite –</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You know what that device can do to the
ill-equipped –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Midnite –</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: – and even in your most glorious days your
brain was never your most powerful attribute –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where the hell is the chair, you dumb
shit?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That was the cancer talking, you know that,
right?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>int. storage area</strong>: Fluorescents flicker, REVEAL
boxes of toilet tissue, cooking supplies, etc. And sitting in one corner
by the huge power transformer is –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity
with straps and cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last
time. Yeah, it’s an electric chair right out of Sing Sing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s in your bathroom, a Renoir?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: I have insurance issues.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You haven’t surfed in decades.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like riding a bike…</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You’ll be lucky to reach an elemental
plane.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then just increase the juice.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: In your condition your body won’t take
much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I just need enough rope to find her.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: And if you do – what then?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One goddamn problem at a time –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want me to sign a waiver?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Midnite sighs – finally straps the other
wrist in – pulls it TIGHT. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hang on, Angela.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sky - close on angela</strong>: moving in a surreal
fashion across an evening sky. Below her the City of Angels sweep past.
Her eyes drift open and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality –</p>
<p><strong>reflection in her eyes</strong>: The city is ON FIRE. It’s a
repeat of Isabel’s prophetic vision before she jumped.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Listen to my voice inside…</p>
<p><strong>int. midnite’s - storage room</strong>: Midnite kneels in
front of John who is now handcuffed to the chair, cables draped from
every limb.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: I’ll try and guide you out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Try?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Mammon was forced out of that girl when she
jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have
fallen back to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, he’s still here. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Then watch yourself. He could be in anyone
out there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Roach wings? What happened to using lilac
pedals – ?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Midnite cranks the JUICE on the panel as
he BLOWS and John reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. His head
slams back against the slats. His skin ripples from the force. STAY ON
his face as the sound of POWER courses through John.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Peter do caelis, Deus, misere nobis. Fili
Redemptor mundi, Deus, Miserere nobis…</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Find the possessor and the Spear will be
revealed… find them… find them and follow…</p>
<p><strong>int. prison chamber from the open</strong>: FROM that
MYSTERIOUS POV, we watch the Prisoner hold the Spear for the first time.
Like before, he turns and looks behind him where – John now stands.
Watching. John centers on the Spear in the Prisoner’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>flash ahead - int. istanbul airport</strong>: That same
MYSTERIOUS POV of the Prisoner in line. He turns as he did before and
it’s – – John behind him. Watching. Prisoner turns away.</p>
<p><strong>flash ahead - ext. lax terminal - evening</strong>:
MYSTERIOUS POV is ON the Prisoner at the exit doors. He looks back,
suspiciously, and there’s - John. Watching. Prisoner turns, heads to the
minivan.</p>
<p><strong>flash ahead - ext. east l.a. - mysterious pov -
night</strong>: of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against
a large iron ENTRANCE GATE. Prisoner is running from it, glances back
–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John is there. Watches as the Prisoner
enters the abandoned wing of – Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he miss
this?</p>
<p><strong>flash ahead - int. sleep room</strong>: Fifty beds with fifty
patients. Asleep. The Prisoner kneels next to one of the beds. John
walks over, touches him and he rocks to the floor. Dead. Body reveals
the Spear on the blanket of the bed. John reaches out to touch it when
the boy BARRY suddenly SITS UP from under the blanket and grabs him by
the throat. NOTE the boy’s BLACKENED FINGERNAILS. John struggles to pull
him off but the boy’s grip is locked tight. John grabs at his hands –
chokes out the name –</p>
<p><strong>midnite!!</strong>: John’s hands suddenly become MIDNITE’S as
his ally pulls him back into –</p>
<p><strong>int. midnite’s - storage room</strong>: John’s face is held
tight in the life-saving fingers of Midnite’s grip. John gasps as he
comes back – nods to Midnite and finally –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ravenscar. The abandoned wing. He’s in the
boy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. over hillside - flying - evening</strong>: WINGED SHADOW
glides across the landscape, sweeps across manicured grounds and rises
to reveal Ravenscar Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>int. midnite’s office - later</strong>: Midnite piles ASSAULT
RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a table.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You know these won’t kill them.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You probably won’t even get close enough to
use them.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: And it’s not just the boy.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: You better worry about whoever’s helping
him.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: As much as I admire your blind faith even
in the most dire situations – expecting to just waltz into a facility
that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even
for you.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Well I suppose two fools can die just as
easily as one.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Hey, you think I’m trusting you to save the
world?</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: But we’re going to need more than a few
magic bullets to get inside.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That ritual you do with the water, can you do
more than one bottle at a time?</p>
<p><strong>ext. ravenscar - night</strong>: The motorized MAIN GATE is
jammed – opening and closing on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner
carjacked. The abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency entrance. John’s
BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John stares out, points up
to the WATER TANK – on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>int. ravenscar - physical therapy room</strong>: Therapy
machines look like medieval torture devices in the dimly-lit room. BARRY
stands waist deep in a large hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile
floor. His skin is pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon
takes its toll. Especially on a child. His hands are below his waist and
now we see they’re lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water.
Her face floats just above the surface as he buckles restraining straps
around her wrists.</p>
<p><strong>int. ravenscar - abandoned wing</strong>: Front glass doors
swing open and John and Midnite calmly strut inside. Stop. HEAR the O.S.
MURMURS of an unseen crowd. This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people.
Lawyers. Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc… Most are crowded in
front of a set of double doors. Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock
on our guys. John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot
cop.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay – let’s cut the scratch and call it a
night. Meeting’s over.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, John, you know how much I love it on this
side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think his son will be any different? He’ll
just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party,
Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No need to get nasty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Never bothered you before.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I am so going to miss our little trysts.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now turn around and take your friends with
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I will deport you. All of you. You know I
can.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, John, this is embarrassing. Where is your
pride?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: Ellie and a room of half-humans –
all looking up as water sprays from every nozzle. John and Midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect. A beat – a SPURT in the
waterlines and suddenly – SHRIEKS fill the room as half human skin
begins to FRY.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Holy water!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m not going back there!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We are what we are, Ellie –</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>int. physical therapy room</strong>: Angela’s body and face
are completely submerged now. She comes to, sees Barry above her – tries
to rise but the boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there. Last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth. Barry places his other hand on
her arm, closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor</strong>: Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine
mist floats in the air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence. Another set of
doors is ahead. Before they reach it a faint shadow crosses in the mist.
Both pause, expecting something to reveal itself. But it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>int. physical therapy room</strong>: Faint waves undulate
Barry’s skin – ripple from his chest, down his arms and into a submerged
Angela. Every muscle in her body tenses in stark relief.</p>
<p><strong>angela’s pov</strong>: Barry’s image ripples above her in
silence. Room lighting starts to pulse – slower and slower and when it’s
caught in that dim half-light – Angela JOLTS and this time we CROSS OVER
INTO –</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room hell</strong>: Angela is lying in a
bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to see a room not much different than
the one she just left. Except for the SOUND. That low DRONE RISING IN
PITCH – those DEMONIC SCREECHES scratching at the walls. And now those
INKY splotches begin consuming the color and light from the walls.
Moving in on Angela. Closer and closer – whatever’s coming is just about
on her.</p>
<p><strong>mammon</strong>: Angela.</p>
<p><strong>int. normal physical therapy room - real time</strong>: John
and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing in the tank. His
hands in the water. On Angela.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Barry!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let her up!! Let her up!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Amar natash bow basar! Rescind from the flesh
I command thee –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Angela’s eyes snap open – dark and
dilated. John sees it – clasps a hand over her mouth – cutting off her
air supply.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Back to Hell, asshole –</p>
<p><strong>midnite</strong>: Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious high pov</strong>: John coughs, struggles to
stand. He tries to cover but it’s obvious his end is nearing. Midnite
positions Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides –
crucifixion-style. She tries but can’t break free. John puts a hand to
her forehead –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam
laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes.</p>
<p><strong>john/midnite</strong>: Rescind from the flesh I command thee
– Amar natash bow basar!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees
a large SHADOW on the ceiling that doesn’t belong to any object. He
holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those
tattoos together –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Into the light I command thee! Into the light
I command thee!</p>
<p><strong>voice of man</strong>: Your ego is astounding.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gabriel?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Figures…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You presume to judge me, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Betrayal, murder, genocide? Call me
provincial.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I am seeking to inspire humankind to be all
that was intended.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: By unleashing Hell on Earth? Good
thinking…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’ve had it too easy for too long.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what’s a few thousand years of pain,
right?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You never deserved to be blessed. You’ve
all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really
appreciating the gift you were given so freely – unconditional love from
your creator.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And that just bugs the shit out of you.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It’s not your fault. Like the animals you
are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded. Pleasure has no
lasting effect. But subject you to pain, unpleasantness – suffering –
and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your
redemption. That is when you’re at your best.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re trying to teach us a lesson?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No, I’m giving you the chance to rise above
the suffering and truly earn the love of God. The road to salvation
begins tonight. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: – where he smashes against a mesh-screened
window, drops to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses.</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room</strong>: Gabriel turns back to Angela.
He approaches her – his rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping
her – pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula.</p>
<p><strong>corridor - john</strong>: can’t even stand, let alone save
the girl. Or humanity. It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and
die. But instead, he tries something he hasn’t done in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … I know I’m not one of your favorites… I’m
not even allowed in your house these days… but I could use a little
attention…</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room - angela’s eyes</strong>: begin to
quiver. The color drains. Blackness is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>corridor - john</strong>: slides his back up the wall as he
reels in that shard of mirror.</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room - angela’s</strong>: posture begins to
change. Mammon’s form ripples through her – starts to push out through
her skin. Gabriel stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her
waist.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Cross the bridge to your destiny…</p>
<p><strong>corridor - john</strong>: pulls up his sleeve, exposes his
old scar. He pauses a beat, closes his eyes. STAY ON his face as he
makes one swift SLICE movement. But he’s in a rush here – makes that
same motion across his other wrist as well. With both wrists purging his
life away, John settles back into the corner and waits for the
inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hurry…</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room - gabriel</strong>: reveals the
Spear.</p>
<p><strong>corridor - john</strong>: is dying. Eyes are starting to
close as…</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room - gabriel</strong>: Raises the Spear
over Angela’s chest. HEAR the SOUNDS of a million DEMONS inside of her
ready to break free – He holds the Spear high above her chest – readies
for the final thrust as –</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and
TIME COMES TO A</p>
<p><strong>complete stop.</strong>: All we’re left with is a distant
METALLIC DRONE, like the reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years
ago. John lies in that dim half-light. Motionless. Something starts to
swirl near him and just like that, John is no longer alone. Shadow falls
over his pathetic form.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: The time has come at last to collect your
soul.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John pries his eyes open…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re early.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: You’re the one show I wouldn’t miss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I didn’t think you’d make the same mistake
twice.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: You didn’t, did you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … so how’s your son?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: And why would that matter to you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … he’s topside…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: With Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Your point?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s helping your son create his own Hell on
Earth…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Well, boys will be boys…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He has the Spear of Destiny.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Satan didn’t know that. Now he’s
concerned. He studies this dying man.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: This is another one of your cons.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go look for yourself…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve waited twenty years for me, what’s
another twenty seconds?</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room - the spear</strong>: is about to be
thrust into Angela’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Gabriel?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Say goodbye to the sun – both of you.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>corridor - john</strong>: is rocked by a major jolt that
shakes the entire building to its foundation. A moment later –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Satan is back. John looks up, gives him
that look – you owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it’s
true.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: So… what do you want? An extension?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Isabel…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … let her… go home…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: You would give up your life so she could go
to Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Fine. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>int. physical therapy room</strong>: ANGELA gasps – her first
real breath’s a strain. Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly
closes her eyes –</p>
<p><strong>ext. that gorgeous sky</strong>: Stretches out BEFORE us. And
here come those two swings, penduluming up in SLOW MOTION. Young Angela
and Isabel share that moment again. But this time Isabel lets go and
jumps out of her swing. Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching
out for what seems so close… so close… Isabel keeps going until she
fades into the sky.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor</strong>: John relaxes, stops fighting the
inevitable. Satan takes his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly
finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try as he
might, he can’t budge John an inch. And now John’s other hand leaves his
side, and as if weightless, begins to rise toward something above. No
sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the embrace of God.
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE –</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: The sacrifice!! No!!!! THIS ONE</p>
<p><strong>belongs to me!!</strong>: John’s rising hand drifts back down
in front of Satan, the middle finger fully extended. Final straw. Satan
goes rabid – turns to PURE ENERGY for a split second. His hands remain
on fire.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: You will live, John Constantine, you will
live so you’ll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in
Hell. You will live!</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. ravenscar</strong>: – through every room. Every
corridor. Rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the
hills beyond.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor</strong>: On his hands and knees, John takes
that first breath. New lungs fill for the first time. No cough. Not even
a wheeze. Face has renewed color. Wrists have sealed tight.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John is healed. He stands, steps back
inside the –</p>
<p><strong>physical therapy room</strong>: John stops over the body of
one seven-foot African warrior. He stands immobilized, wrecked with
emotion. A SOUND draws his attention to the one thing that could cause
him even greater rage –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel –</strong>: is hunched over near a wall. Jagged
cartilage stumps protrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him. It’s all that remains of his once
majestic wings. John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former
angel. He realizes what this means. Gets a kick out of it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Human…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t deserve to be human.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Then pass judgment on me now.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Do it. Seek revenge. End my life.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Kill me! Pull the trigger! Be the hand of
God!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … and I’ll be condemned again…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It takes everything John has not to pull
that trigger. He lowers the gun, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re even worthless as bait.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Deny your true nature today, but what of
tomorrow, of the tomorrow after that? It is only a matter of time before
you end up right back where you belong. It is who you are, Constantine.
Damned.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s called pain. Get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thank you, John.</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - midnite’s universal orrery</strong>:
MOVING SLOWLY PAST the inoperative device. PAST strangely-shaped objects
of platinum and gold, with names and symbols that make a bit more sense
now.</p>
<p><strong>ext. africa - day</strong>: Huge sun beats down on a lone
FIGURE walking across a stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth.
He stops, kneels to the heavily-cracked soil. Starts digging.</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - the orrery</strong>: A HAND comes in,
affixes an unseen object to a protruding rod. Its weight causes it to
drop OUT OF FRAME but a moment later it rises back INTO VIEW and finds a
balance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. africa</strong>: JOHN pulls back the protective hood
from his face. Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around the Spear of
Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at it a long beat.</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s apartment - the orrery</strong>: The entire
mechanism shudders. And now miraculously, every globe, every moon, every
obscure object in this miniature occult universe begins to rotate in
complete sync. As it does, the defining object finally slides INTO VIEW.
John’s lighter. ANGELA watches it rotate past, nods in approval.</p>
<p><strong>ext. africa</strong>: John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of
soil over the sacred relic. He stands, nods. Job done. A breeze blows
past and John senses being watched. He spins and finds – nothing. For a
hundred miles. He starts walking.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some people are born to make a difference. I
had to die. Twice.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 20 lanes bowling alley - angela</strong>: walking right
in step. Something is closing in on her. A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is
driving. Angela gets in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: God does work in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>ext. africa</strong>: John continues walking as something
closes in on him at incredible speed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some people like it…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some people don’t.</p>
