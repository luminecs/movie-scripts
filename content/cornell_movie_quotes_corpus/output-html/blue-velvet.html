<p><strong>closeup - mr. beaumont</strong>: He’s doubling over and falls
to the ground. He continues to grasp onto the hose.</p>
<p><strong>gregg’s mother</strong>: Gregg. Billy’s waiting for his
teddy.</p>
<p><strong>gregg’s mother</strong>: GREGG! Billy’s waiting for his
teddy, honey.</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Louise? Where’s Jeffrey? His mother’s
on the phone - it’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He disappeared to the men’s room a little
while ago. I’m getting very tired of waiting - let’s go find him.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don’t
force girls!</p>
<p><strong>college boy</strong>: Jeffrey, your mother’s on the phone.
It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thanks for keeping me waiting so long.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m sorry, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello. Mom? What’s wrong with Dad?. What’s
happening?. Come home? Sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: I mean, for good, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: For good?. I can’t. Mom. Not right in the
middle of the term.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Jeffrey. honey. Your father’s
condition is serious. It’s going to cost so much. We just won’t have the
money to keep you in school. I’m telling you this now, so that you can
get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you
have to do. it’ll save you another trip back. You’re going to have to
work at the store.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Can’t you come to the damn airport?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jeffrey. I can’t. I really can’t. I have to
go to that class tonight. I can’t get out of it. I really can’t. I love
you, Jeffrey. I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Alright. I’ll call you in a couple of days,
you know. I’ll let you know how things are.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Okay. I’ll be here. You better git-going. I
gotta go too sweetie. I hope your father’s okay. I love you. I’m sorry,
Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I love you too, Louise. Damn it. I’ll see
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Where’s all your things, Jeffrey?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all
I have.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a
nice flight?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. How’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: He’s alright. We’ll tell you on the
way home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they
think there’s some sort of clot, or tumor, or something in there.
They’re doing all sorts of tests. On the surface, he looks pretty good,
but there are problems. They think he may have to stay in two weeks now,
at least. You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: They tore down the A &amp; P, Jeffrey.
Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Aunt Barbara that was 5 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: Home again, home again, jiggidy
jog.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Be right down.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: This is marvelous jam. Are you going
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: I think Jeffrey would like to see his
father alone.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What time are visiting hours?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: I’ve made arrangements with Dr. Gynde
for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you’ll have to walk over; I need the car this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Jeffrey, when you see your
father.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: He doesn’t know you’re out of school.
He thinks it’s a vacation for you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: It would be too much for him. So
please let him think as he does, that you’re home just to see him.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Thanks a lot, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave
school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be
an option one day. I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: I think it’s important not to get
depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on
illness.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Aunt Barbara. I’ll try not to get
depressed.</p>
<p><strong>nurse cindy</strong>: Please wait outside while Dr. Gynde
prepares him to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Prepares him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gynde</strong>: Hello Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>dr. gynde</strong>: He’s fighting hard. Jeffrey. it’s very
important that your father doesn’t try to move. he’s been immobilized.
It would be very painful for him. sit close. you do the talking and
moving. He knows you’re here. He became very emotional. I don’t think he
likes the idea of you seeing him like this.</p>
<p><strong>nurse cindy</strong>: Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hi Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaumont</strong>: Hey Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Looks like they’ve got you strapped in
pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaumont</strong>: uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Are you feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaumont</strong>: uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaumont</strong>: Good to see you, son.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’s good to see you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello. could you tell me if Detective
Williams is still working here?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: He’s up in Room 221. Right up the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Are you Detective Williams?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near
you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont’s Hardware
Store?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Sure I do. I understand he’s in
the hospital. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: He’s alright, I guess. I hope. They’re
doing tests, that’s why I’m home from school. I was over at the hospital
this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our
neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: You did? A human ear?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I’ve got it here in this bag. I
thought I should bring it to you.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Yep, that’s right. Let’s take a
look at it.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: That sure looks like a human
ear, doesn’t it?. Let’s run it down to the Coroner’s Office and see what
they make of it. Then, I want you to show me exactly where you found
it.</p>
<p><strong>coroner’s officer</strong>: The tests will take awhile.
Meanwhile, we’ll check the morgue records. I don’t recall anything
coming in minus an ear.</p>
<p><strong>coroner’s officer</strong>: Now if you’d found a jaw or let’s
say, a heart, or even an arm, we would assume that there was a corpse,
however, a finger or an ear. the person may very well be alive
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What can you tell about the person from the
ear?</p>
<p><strong>coroner’s officer</strong>: Well. when the tests are done,
quite a lot . Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead
person. Right now, I know what you know. It’s a real human ear. The
human was, or is, Caucasian. . also. It looks like the ear was cut off
with scissors.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: By the way, Jeffrey, this story
isn’t going to the press and I’m going to ask you to consider all you’ve
heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone,
but me, or other police personnel. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much
as you did.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Come on. I’ll drive you home.
It’s on my way.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello?. LOUISE WERTHAM please. Louise? . is
she there?. Louise? Yeah! How are you? He’s okay. in the hospital for
tests. I miss you so much. What have you been up to?. Louise, I don’t
know. I’ve got to see how my father is . It costs a fortune in that
hospital. When did he ask you to that?. Look. I can’t stop you. Go
ahead. Just go ahead . I may never be back, go. ahead. Look Louise, stop
trying to explain everything. Just do it. let’s talk again in a couple
of days or somethin’, okay?. Yeah, I still love you. Goodbye Louise.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m going out for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Do you want the car?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No, I’m just gonna walk around.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: Jeffrey. you’re not going down by
Lincoln, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No. I’m just going to walk around the
neighborhood. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is
Detective Williams in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He’ll be
back any minute now. You’re welcome to wait. Is it urgent?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I just wanted to ask him a few questions,
that’s all. Maybe I better go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Really, he’ll be home soon, would you
like a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: I was sorry to hear about your
father. I know your mother from church. It’s such a shame.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Would you like a piece of cake?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No. No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: It’s a real good chocolate cake.
Duncan Hines’ devil’s food. real good.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Sandy?.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy,
and. her boyfriend, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mike’s gotta go. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, nice meetin’ yuh.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. It was nice meeting you too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: He comes over to study.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Pam?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: In the kitchen, John!</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Oh. Hello, Jeffrey. what’s
up?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Come into the study a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Detective Williams here. yeah.
Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy. Well, Jeffrey, you found
something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you
must be curious to know more. But. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask
you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask
more about the case. One day. when it’s all sewed up, I’ll let you know
all the details. Right now, though. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I understand. I’m just real curious like
you said.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: I was the same way when I was
you age. I guess that’s what got me into this business.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It must be great.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: And it’s horrible too. I’m sorry
Jeffrey. That’s the way it has to be. Anyway. I’m sure you do
understand.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Oh, you’re welcome. Nice to finally
meet you, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Say “goodnight” to Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: We will. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Are you the one that found the ear.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah, how did you know?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I just know, that’s all. I remember you from
Central.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You were pretty popular. Didn’t you run for
some office?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn’t you be
studying or something.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Am I bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No. You’re not bothering me. You a
senior?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: How is Central these days?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Terrible. boring.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What else is new?. right?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah. What are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m home from school. My father’s in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What do you know about the ear?.
anything?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Didn’t my father tell you not to talk about
it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Come on. you brought it up. Do you know
anything?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t really know much but bits and pieces
. I hear things. My room is right above my father’s office. The ear.
there’s no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a
living person. That’s direct from the Coroner’s Office. The person is
unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think
there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder
case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the
same names.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Do you know who was brought in for
questioning?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: There were at least three, maybe four. But a
name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment
building very close to your house and also close to the field where you
found the ear. There’s also a business man over by the Franklin factory
district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Were all these people questioned this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No. this has been going on for some time .
several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found
down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They
never found one complete body. only parts.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: The ear is from a missing person maybe?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’s a strange world isn’t it? Do you know
what building the woman lives in?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah. It’s close by. that’s what’s creepy.
They’ve had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I
don’t know what they’ve found out because my father isn’t in charge of
her.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I guess you have to get back home soon?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Not really, why? You want to see the
building?. Come on, I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That’s the building. She lives on the Seventh
Floor. Don’t stop to look long . the police are watching.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know. you’re not supposed to see
them. They’re supposed to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Did they find out anything when they
questioned her?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know. like I said, she’s not my
father’s case.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Oh yeah. What about those other people? .
Anything?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: My father is watching the businessman. The
businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and
family, his wife and two kids. They think he’s been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You really do hear a lot, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do
now that you’re home?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I have to help out in my father’s hardware
store. they’re giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is
nice.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Still, it must be kinda rough.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’s not bad. but it’s bad enough. it’s a
lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who
had the biggest tongue in the world.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I don’t know. he moved away.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I’ve gotta go in.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I guess I’ll see you sometime.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I guess so. Like you said. It’s a strange
world.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug
spraying rigs later on?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs
they’re yours. It causes me no pain.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okidoke Ed. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You hungry or thirsty, or both?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’d like to talk to you about
something.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Just a minute. pull over and wait a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Please, don’t say anything to Mike.
promise?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I don’t want to cause any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I’m here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I guess Mike’s got some sort of sports
practice in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Ooooo, you are smart. Just don’t get too
smart.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Alright, now tell me. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: There are opportunities in life for gaining
knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it’s necessary to
take a risk. I got to thinking. I’ll bet a person could learn a lot by
getting into that woman’s apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and
observe.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You said it was a strange world. and you’re
the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in
murder. This gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Settle down. I have a plan which I think
will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help.
.Aren’t you curious about my plan?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It wouldn’t hurt to hear the plan, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Alright. the first thing is to get into her
apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Now, how are you going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Right out in the car I happen to have some
old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be
the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes
you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I
will then jimmy a window.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What will I say when she comes to the
door?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You will be a Jehovah’s Witness. I have a
few “Awake” magazines for you. You don’t have to keep her very long. a
few seconds is all I’ll need. Whatiya think?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know. it sounds like a good daydream,
. but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Let’s just try the first part. If that goes
well, we’ll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one
would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something
like this.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’ve got a point there.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Now. we’ll walk over so there’s no license
plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it’s more,
but I need time to find a good window .alright?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay, I’m going ahead. Wait a minute,
what’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.
Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck .
three minutes, no sooner.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Alright. Good luck, yourself.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Well, it’s about time you came.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That’s a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Pest control. gotta do your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh God, that stuff stinks.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Nope. it’s new stuff. no smell.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh yeah, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: What is this. Grand Central Station?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That oughta do it.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. let’s get outta here. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I was just about to go to the door, when that
man did my job for me. Was it alright?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes and no. Did you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No. I only saw his back. He went down another
stairwell at the end of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I didn’t get a good look at him either, but
he sure looked at me. I didn’t have time to get a window, but I found
this key. Pretty nifty, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah, if it opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: So. what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Pretty clever. Are you game for more?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I owe you. since I goofed up this one.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You didn’t goof it up, but. you still owe
me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It’s Friday. do you have a date
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes. I do.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well, it’s Friday night and you’re a
beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You really want to do this, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I don’t want you to get involved, really, I
mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may
be involved in murder.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I’ll tell Mike I’m sick. There’s a game
tonight anyway and he’ll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with
the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What
do want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: First of all, we’ll have a nice dinner. Try
to find out where Dorothy sings.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I already know. The “Slow Club.” It’s on
Route 7.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Great. I’ll pick you up around eight
o’clock. Is that good?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah, but don’t pick me up. my father may
think it’s strange. I’ll walk over to your house. I’ll be there at eight
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay. You better get out before someone
sees us.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: See ya!</p>
<p><strong>dr. gynde</strong>: That will take care of you, Frances, for
another week. I don’t want you to overdo things either. Take it very
easy.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: I’ll see to it, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gynde</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gynde</strong>: That’s not the point. You’re under a
great deal of stress. don’t overdo it. don’t be foolish.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Doctor Gynde. my whole family’s sick.
What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: I’m not sick.</p>
<p><strong>aunt barbara</strong>: We’ll see who stays in my will.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Can I use the car tonight?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaumont</strong>: Of course, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: First of all, we’re going to the Slow Club
to see Dorothy Vallens. We’ll watch her for awhile. I’d like to hear her
sing anyway, and then also we’ll know she is there and not in her
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Then we’ll drive back to her apartment and
I will plant myself there.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: This is not my usual Friday night!</p>
<p><strong>sleazy maitre d’</strong>: Good evening. two?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. Could we get a small table in the
back?</p>
<p><strong>slezy maitre d’</strong>: Surely, come this way.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: May I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’d like an ice-cold Heineken.</p>

<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady. Miss
Dorothy Vallens.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey, I don’t think you ought to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn’t
have told you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’ll be okay. I don’t think you should
wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this
car?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah. but.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Leave it in the front of your house for me.

point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: No, Mike. but there are vitamins in
the food, you know.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like a machine. EVERYTHING has got
to stay in perfect tune for perfect health. That’s what I’m interested
in.</p>

minute.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Well, how did it go?. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well. I’ve found out some things. nothing
really for certain. There are some strange people involved.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well. Maybe we should discuss this
somewhere else. you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Mike?. Are you alright?</p>

<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Sure thing. please don’t worry about me.
Can I help you with the dishes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. williams</strong>: Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but
certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I’m sure Sandy will be
back soon.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Jeffrey?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: If you want to come up a minute,
I’ll show you some pictures.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Take a look at these. These are
the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear. You might find
them interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: These are beautiful. How’s the case
coming?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Anything you can tell me?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: The criminals are winning.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Is that why you say it’s horrible?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I guess you’ve seen some bad things.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Yes I have - so bad I wouldn’t
poison your mind by telling you.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: I won’t let the bastards get me
up against the wall. It’s an act of defiance.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What is this? What color is it?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Blue. It’s Blue Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Can I use the car for a while?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Sure. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: A Dairy Queen? Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds
great.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What’s with Mike?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: He got a little jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s okay. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You want a Dairy Queen?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No way. I’m about to blow up.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You want to tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: . OK. It’s a strange world, Sandy. this is
what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is
married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the
husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off
both of Don’s ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for
him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay
alive. there is another man involved. I call him the “yellow man”. you
saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don’t know what he
does but I think he’s on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very
dangerous man.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Wow. Should you tell my father?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I don’t see how I can. and I can’t prove
any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you
in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You saw a lot in one night.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: . Actually. I’ve been in twice.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Twice. without her sensing anything?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Did you see her undressed?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That doesn’t bother you, does it?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Who, me? Why should it?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’re sure right. It is a strange world.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Why are there people like Frank. Why is
there so much trouble in this world.?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know. I had a dream. in fact. the
night I met you. . in the dream the world was dark because there weren’t
any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love.
and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any
difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah I guess so. You’re a neat girl.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: So are you. I mean you’re a neat guy. We
better get back.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I guess so. you want to help me watch
Frank?. I’m going to stake out Frank’s place tomorrow. with a
camera.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No, silly - I’m still in school you know. but
I’ll meet you after school and you can tell me what you’ve learned. You
better be careful, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I will. I’ll pick you up on the same corner
at three thirty-five, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Okay. be careful.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Can I give you a kiss good night?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You better not, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay. okay.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: See ya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
even more trouble with Frank. I hope not. I hope not. tomorrow I have to
find out more about Frank.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Fifteen more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You gotta wait for me Sandy. I’m on a real
roll.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: He was blown away man. can’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>guy #2</strong>: That cracker was the biggest dealer in this
section of the city, brother. the police are going to find more drugs in
there than you can believe. It’s a speedball heaven in there.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Oh yeah? What about the woman?</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: Probably just a whore he happened to be with
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Man oh brother.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: This is the way the world is my man. take a
good look.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You were late.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: What am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You want to go talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yeah, but. I don’t think it’s going to do
much good. Let’s go. I’ll try to talk to him later.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You know, that cheese is practically all
chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That’s what makes it so good. You wanta
hear what I saw today?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank’s building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what
does this prove?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Nothing really, but it’s interesting. they
know each other. they seem to like each other.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on
drugs. I think Frank supplies him.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They
drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at
something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance
was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs
broken.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey!!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Then these guys told me the police will
find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man’s place.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I can’t believe what you are finding out. Are
you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey?. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m seeing something that was always
hidden. I’m involved in a mystery. I’m learning. and it’s all
secret.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You like mysteries that much?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. you’re a mystery. I like you. very
much.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Don’t. please, Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You worry about me really?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a
lot. I got you into this.</p>

<p><strong>sandy</strong>: We broke up. No. It’s okay. It’s okay.
Jeffrey?. Jeffrey?. Hey, Jeffrey?. Do you want to go to a party with me

Friday. You don’t dance? Well, I’ll teach you, silly.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Great. Hey. I’ve got a bit of a problem. I
know some things. that could help your father but you might get into
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey. are they important things? Well
forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Ok but I promise I won’t mention you. Okay?
.I’ll see him at the police station. okay? See you Friday night, if not

<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Jeffrey! Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hi. Hi Sandy. I’m sorry to bother you, but
I’ve got to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Okay. come on in. Looks like you
had a bad face lift.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay. I gotta tell you. I’ve. discovered
some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some
things about them. The first picture is this.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: This is Frank Booth. His address is on the
back of the photo. He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous. This
photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank’s
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: And that man came out with a third man -
this well-dressed guy. here’s the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy
Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her
husband and her son.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I have no hard proof of any of this. Her
address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with
drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. . and
somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got
slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it’s over now
for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could
help.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Well now Jeffrey, how did you
come to get so involved?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I can’t tell you the whole story. I. I took
it upon myself. I can’t say more.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Is Sandy part of this?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No. not at all.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Who knows you have these?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Only you. and the photo lab.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: You’re all through with this
now?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes sir. I sure am.</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: For now. Alright. you better be.
And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared
to come in for further interrogation on this later.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him
some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You didn’t tell him about me?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I should never had gotten you going on this.

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey pretty pretty.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey fuck, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey!!</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Because of your information I
alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on
with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he
found out we were going to raid Frank’s place.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?</p>
<p><strong>detective williams</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Oh my God. Is her son OK?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. man</strong>: We’re looking for him. In your opinion,
why did Frank kidnap Dorothy’s son and husband?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: He became obsessed with her. She hated him.
He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do
things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears
as a warning to her to stay alive. I’m not kidding. Frank loved blue.
blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. man</strong>: You seemed to see some very interesting
things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I guess I did. What’s going to happen
to me?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. man</strong>: We’re going to leave that up to
Detective Williams. I’ll tell you though. you’re okay. you shot a real
son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many
more are out there?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay. I’ll be right in.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: How ya doin’ Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaumont</strong>: Hey Jeff. I’m feelin’ so much
better.</p>
