<h1 id="henry-fool">henry-fool</h1>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Where the hell have you been? Mom, come on and
eat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Then why’d I cook!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know why you cooked! I don’t know why
you bother!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Sit down and eat, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: God, I wanna get fucked.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Get up off your knees.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Where you gotta go to get a six-pack of beer
around here?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Say something.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: She’s mute.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: She don’t – you know – talk.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Stay the hell out of my store, you
good-for-nothing punks!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Look at this! What’s going on here? Simon,
get up off the floor! Is this beer paid for?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Centuries ago it had an ‘e’ at the end.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Where do you come from?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nowhere in particular.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I go where I will and I do what I must.
That’s why I’m in trouble. I’m sort’ve what you might call… ‘in
exile’.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why are you in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: An honest man is always in trouble, Simon.
Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I am not retarded.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well… I’ll take your word for that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: People. I mean. They think. You know.
Because.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Here. Take this. And…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: …this. Keep them with you at all times. You
ever feel like you got something to say and you can’t get it out, stop
and write it down. OK?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: This? This is my life’s work. My memoirs. My
‘Confession’.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ve been bad. Repeatedly. But why brag? The
details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive
consideration of general truths. What is this? It’s a philosophy. A
poetics. A politics, if you will. A literature of protest. A novel of
ideas. A pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions. It is,
in the end, whatever the hell I want it to be. And when I’m through with
it, it’s gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world’s own
idea of itself!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, let’s go break their arms!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: If I’m quiet.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Once. I forget where I was. Central America
maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and water
so foul the natives wouldn’t even piss in it. This crowd of drunken
motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room
and threatens to tear me limb from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, OK,
you’ve got me outnumbered four to one and you’re gunna kill me here
tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I’m
gone. Fine. But one of you… one of you… one of you is gunna have his eye
torn out. Period. Silence. I repeat myself. One of you poor, underpaid
jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It’s a
small thing, perhaps, all things considered. But I will succeed. Because
it’s the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don’t you
just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for
a few minutes more. They sober up a little, look at their shoes in
confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, here I am, still, after all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Did you throw up all over some girl?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They were throwing bottles at the house.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s got some ex-con in there she met at the
bar. Tattoos all over himself and a big red bloated nose.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did you take your pills?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You want me to tell her to be quiet?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s the use? She might as well get it while
she can. She’s not always gunna have the ass she has now, you know.
That’s just how life is.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, huh? Here,
have a donut. Can you lend me twenty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thanks. Where’s the library in the scruffy
little burgh?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Down the highway about a mile and a half and
then make a left.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Excellent! I’m polishing up the final
chapters of my ‘Confession’ and I need a reasonably well-stocked
reference section.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can I take this?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ll correct the spelling.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: One of you is gunna lose an eye.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: One of you is gunna lose an eye!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: One of you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can set me on fire. But one of you is
gunna have an eye torn out of your head. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Take me home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon! Who did this to you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I was gunna tear out their eyes. I knew I
could do it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Whose eyes?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I told them. Like you said. I told them. And
I knew I could do it.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: You should take him home. He smells like a
toilet.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a hospital!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh, shut up! Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This kinda thing has happened before.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: This your husband?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Mr Fool, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s poetry.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Of course I’m sure. I corrected the spelling
myself.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: It made my daughter sing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah, well, you know – that’s what poetry
does.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: But she has never spoken in her life.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Owww!!!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Keep still!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Let me do it!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Fine! You do it, Simon! I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Mom! Simon’s got a broken rib, his shoulder’s
dislocated or something, and he won’t let me disinfect the gash in his
head!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Fay, just take him to the hospital, will
ya!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: But he won’t go!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Simon Grim, you go to the hospital with Fay
right now, do hear me!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What the hell were you trying to do when you
wrote this thing?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, you know you wrote it in a kind of
iambic pentameter.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Iambic what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Verse.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Look, in my opinion, this is pretty powerful
stuff. Though your spelling is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a little
naive, your instincts are profound. But the whole thing needs to be
given a more cohesive shape. It can be expanded. Followed through.
Unified. You see what I’m getting at?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Are you willing to commit yourself to this?
To really work on it? To give it its due? In the face of adversity and
discouragement? To rise to the challenge you yourself have set?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And don’t gimme that wonderstruck
‘I’m-only-a-humble-garbage-man’ bullshit, either.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It hurts to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Of course it does.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah. No. OK?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t move! Fuck. There.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are you sure that’s right?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes. Now shut up and lie back.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is this gunna hurt?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You gunna be alright?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Here. Bite on this.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s blood. From your head. Lie back. Shove
that in your mouth and hold on to something.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Okay. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Aaagghhh!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: So, do you have, like, you know, a girlfriend,
Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Do you find me attractive?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I look young for my age, don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: How old do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You look young.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: How young?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I don’t know. Young.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: But how… I mean, do I look more like twenty,
or… you know, thirty?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thirty.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Listen, you geek, after a couple of drinks
plenty of people mistake me for eighteen!</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Hey, Warren, are you a registered voter?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Bug off, Vicky!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: ‘Saving America From Itself.’ What the fuck
is this?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: It’s everything you need to know about the
upcoming elections and congressman Owen Feer and all the really good
things he wants to do for our country.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Oh yeah, like what?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: He wants to win back this country for us
Americans, Warren, and restore some kind of cultural-moral standard to
our way of life.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What time’s your kid go off to school?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: How about I come over and visit you
later?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Well, I don’t know, Warren. I mean…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Come on. I mean it. I’m trying to
change.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: How dare you put something like this up where
anyone can see it!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: It’s poetry.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: It’s pornography! The product of a diseased
mind! You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Mr Deng!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: It made Gnoc sing.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: It’s disgusting! There oughta be a law or
something!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There’s no accounting for taste, is there, Mr
Deng?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: See, Simon, there are three kinds of there.
There’s ‘There’. T-H-E-R-E. There are the donuts. Then there’s T-
H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It is their donut. Then, finally,
there’s ‘they’re’. T-H-E-Y-’-R-E. A contraction, meaning they are.
They’re the donut people. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And look, if you’re gunna read Wordsworth
you’ve gotta get a more up-to-date edition. This odoriferous tome you’re
so attached to doesn’t even have all fourteen books of the Prelude. And
you need notes. Commentary. I’ll go to the library and find you the best
edition they have.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Thank you, but that’s OK. I’ll stop there on
my way back from work. Well, yes, maybe not today, but, you know,
tomorrow, probably.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Quit.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: My job?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You need time to write, Simon. To study. To
reflect.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But I like my job.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We all have to make sacrifices. A vocation
like ours, Simon, is not a nine to five thing. You can’t put a fence
around a man’s soul. We think and feel where and when we can think and
feel. We are the servants of our muse and we toil where she
commands.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: She’s clinically depressed.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah, and what’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I guess it means it’s not her fault.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You ever think of leaving?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: To go where?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Out there. You know, into the world. Where
ever.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: ‘Opportunity will step away and make room for
a man to pass it by.’</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is that from your book?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No. I found it in a fortune cookie.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can I read your confession?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No. Not yet. Soon. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is it almost finished?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, you know, Simon, a piece of work like
this, it’s… A vocation like ours… You can’t put a fence around a man’s
soul. What I’m trying to achieve, it’s… Well, it takes a lifetime
really. It’s a life’s work. But soon. Don’t worry. I’d appreciate your
feedback. I gotta go. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What are you doing there, Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m writing a poem.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: So what? It ain’t so great.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That him?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Pardon me, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uhm. Look, ah… I’m the editor of the high
school newspaper now and…</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: One of the editors.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: One of the editors, and we…</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I… wanted to know if we could print your poem
in this month’s issue.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Because I think it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who cares what you think?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re a drag.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A well-known drag.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Ma, you take your medication?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Guess so.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Evening, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ve got these books for Simon.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Well, leave ’em there on the counter, then.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Immigrant.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Mommy!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Listen. I know a man. He’s a big shot in the
publishing business. Angus James. Smart, adventurous and tons of
integrity. When this thing is ready, I’ll recommend he reads it. He’ll
respect my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A man was here today looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What man?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t know. He drove by the house a few
times.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why do they torment me like this? Why?
They’re like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What do they want from you?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They want to suffocate me, Simon! They wanna
extinguish me like a flame!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They’re afraid, that’s why! They’re afraid of
what I might do! What I might say! Think! They’re afraid of my
ideas!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You and I are alike in this way, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We’re outsiders. We think and feel too much
and too deeply. And the world can’t handle that. Our mere existence is a
threat to its illusion of security. Sure, they’ll name a wing of a new
library after us when we’re dead! But now… Now, when we’re alive… Now,
they wanna burn us at the stake!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Scram.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For example, I made love to your mother about
half an hour ago and now I’m beginning to think that maybe it wasn’t
such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I mean to say, I think Fay may be
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t want to think about this.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Bad move, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A poet has got to be able to think about
anything.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Am I really a poet?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Of course you are! A great poet! But you need
experience. You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a
while, for cryin’ out loud.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on! Let’s go out! There’s a den of
iniquity right across the street! You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That man’s a bad influence.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: On who?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon. Hey, Simon. Come on. I got ya some
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s a computer. You write on it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Here’s the manual.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I stole it. Now listen. Remember how
yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation
to the readability of…</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh, shit! Not you again!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon, I can’t work under these
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah! Get outta here, you freak!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Get a life!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Eat shit and die, Henry!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Beast! Fiend! Rapist!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh, shut up, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, wait up!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I am not a rapist!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shit. Come on, this way.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Keep a look out. Tell me when he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, what’s going on? Who is that guy?
What’s he want?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He wants to help me! He wants to be my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Help you with what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: I doubt.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So, you’re an honest man. Why beat yourself
up about it?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: I don’t know if there are grounds for
faith. Is my vocation relevant? Does it make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A difference in what?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: The world. The way it is. Is this a
way to help relieve suffering?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Your vocation makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: How can you be so sure?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Because vocation is the difference. Only
someone who really cares doubts. Listen, father, as I was about to tell
my friend Simon here, I am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a
hundred miles of this parish. But still, I’ve gotta stay up late at
night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities I see
committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit
culture we call home.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: You seem to me to be a sensitive and
generous man.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I like to think so. But the fact is I
appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, I insist your vocation makes a
difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual
yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss.
Listen, have you got any money? Let’s go have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Excuse me, miss, are you a registered
voter?</p>
<p><strong>miss</strong>: Oh God, really I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Well, I’d like to give you some information
about Congressman Owen Feer. This man is gunna make a big difference in
the lives of every American in the years to come…</p>
<p><strong>miss</strong>: Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Pardon me, sir…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What time’s your mother get off work?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Fay, are you a registered voter?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Don’t you dare talk that way to me! And keep
your hands off my brother. Pearl, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’m watchin’ her.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You and Vicky get back together?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I gotta regular job now and everything.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I saw this retard on TV this morning.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He’s gunna be the next president of the
United States of America, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Keep dreamin’ Warren. The guy’s a Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I like him!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Gimme a light.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He’s a decent man. He takes complicated
issues and totally simplifies them. And I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You still sell dope?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: No. You know what the problem is with this
country, Fay? Me. I’m the problem. We live in a culture of poverty and
crime, where the work ethic is undermined and male responsibility is
made irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Come on, Pearl, let’s go play at my house.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: She gives you any trouble, Fay, you just let
me know.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Do you think human beings are
innately bad?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Worse than bad! Monstrous! But I love that
about them. Wake up, Simon!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Jesus Christ, Simon, you’re letting yourself
go to hell! You read that flyer I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Simon, wake up and smell the coffee, huh!
It’s up to guys like you and me to help create a better tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Why would I steal a computer from the
campaign office?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I’m not saying you did, I’m just saying one
was and since you do have this criminal background…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Don’t judge me!</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Look, I know you know him. People have seen
you around together.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: I’m his parole officer.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: I’m not supposed to talk about that stuff
with people.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He’s my. Friend.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Mr Deng says you’re some sort of a poet, or
something.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: You tell Henry to call me – Officer Bu�uel –
pronto! Or they’re gunna chuck his ass straight back into jail! Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Vicky, look I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Don’t you even come near me!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What do you mean, you quit?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I quit my job.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Why!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There are things I want to do.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: ‘Opportunity will step out of the way to let
a man… pass it by.’</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Now you have to go out and get a job!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I am not gettin’ a job! Who’s gunna look after
Mom!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Pearl, go outside.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: If you treat Mom like a sick person, she’s
gunna stay like… you know, a sick person.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, don’t be retarded…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I am not retarded!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I can see with my own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Mom can’t be left alone with no one to keep an
eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, who’s been keeping an eye on her while
you’ve been out getting fucked by every OTB winner in town?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Aggghhhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What happened to her, Simon? How did she get
this way? Will it happen to me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked up?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry… Your parole officer, Officer Bu�uel,
came by again today.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He told me to tell you that if you don’t call
him they’re gunna put you back in jail.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He gave me this number…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, well, you
know, I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon, just shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Forgive me, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Call him, Henry. Please.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a library
card?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Check this out for me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Milton. Seventeenth century. English. You
see, Simon, it’s important my ‘Confession’ dig up the past, comb
previous evidence and help chart the historic – even the aesthetic –
inevitability of my ideas. And…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: This place is crawling with chicks, Simon.
Wander around. Leer a little. Cop a feel. Impose yourself on ’em. See
what happens.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I make girls uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Bullshit! You’ve got a rough hewn charm that
sets ’em on edge. Now, listen, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I got caught.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: ‘Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend
replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable…’</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad?
Does she know how beautiful she is? Do people tell her? Does she ever
feel stupid?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why don’t I smile when she looks at me? I
look away. Ashamed of myself.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Her figure makes me violent. I want to
somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why do I do this to myself? And why do I
reduce you to only one possibility? These are not even questions
anymore. I know the answers myself. This isn’t a page of notes. It’s a
letter. A letter to you. A desperate act. You are a miracle to me. I
can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: How are you, Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Peachy. Gimme a light.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Have you found a job?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: How ’bout those Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings, did you go over and visit them yet?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What happened to this assistant librarian
position you were supposed to set me up with?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: I tried, Henry. I really did.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Henry, with your background… Well, I mean,
with your record, they didn’t think it’d be right to have you at the
neighborhood library.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: They thought you’d be a bad influence on the
kids.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Or worse.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So my word is not enough. My promise
worthless. The fact I’ve served my time nothing but the emblem of my
continuing guilt.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m creating my r�sum�. This computer’s got a
program especially for it. I bought some special stationery too. It’s
scented. Look.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It’s roses.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can you type my poem into that thing?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: That’s your poem?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, Mom’s right about you. A poem’s supposed
to be a small, delicate kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle. Look at
this. You’ve made a fuckin’ telephone book.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was caught. Yes, I was caught… once. I was
caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named
Susan. She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play
upon my weaknesses which, I admit, are deep and many.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You appear shocked.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It was a pathetic little conspiracy. A
transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label
me a mere pedophile. As if I’d be ashamed of such a thing. As if
Socrates himself hadn’t been taken out of circulation for corrupting the
youth of Athens!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Seven years. Seven years for one afternoon of
blissful transgression. But what of it? Who cares? Prison’s not so bad;
particularly if one’s a sex offender, free from the popular and
conventional horror of sodomy.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They were not ‘lost years’.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I put them to good use. I began my major
work. My opus.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Believe me, Simon, this incident with the
girl, prison… It pales to insignificance in the wider context of my
career.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nothing in comparison to the day my
‘Confession’ is unleashed. What an orgy we’ll have then, huh? What
shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious
purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever
inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue. They’ll be beside
themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis. Apoplectic with
indignation!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Their feelings will be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes, like a mirror which reflects only the
inside of the person before it, my ‘Confession’ will lovingly render
humanity’s common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why should I blush or feel shame before the
common lot of humanity, anyway, for a few banal and, again I admit,
inelegant transgressions?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: After all, really, I’m doing civilization a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: When can I read it?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: We are told not to judge. But to
forgive. Not to look into our neighbor’s eye to find the bad, but to
find the good. Now this is difficult. I admit. But having a good friend
is not always easy.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes, but… do you think Henry is…
dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: He needs help. Our help. Yours
especially.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But what can I do?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: The best parts of himself come to the
surface when he’s helping someone learn. I’ve seen this. Let yourself be
taught. Show your appreciation for his guidance. In this way, you know,
perhaps. Well. There’s hope for everyone. Even. Even Henry.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex, will
ya?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: The violence of the imagery reminds me of early
Clash, while the lyricism of the verse recalls, for me, Walt
Whitman.</p>
<p><strong>bibi</strong>: I would have said Dickinson, maybe even Eliot,
and so on. But I agree with the punk roots…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The greats all say the same thing: little.
And what little there is to be said is immense. Or, in other words,
follow your own genius to where it leads without regard for the apparent
needs of the world at large, which, in fact, has no needs as such, but,
rather, moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice. We
can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness. This
divine fatigue… this…</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Push over.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As I tried to make plain in Paris: ‘Nous
savons que nous avons chut� parce que nous savons qui nous sommes.’ ‘We
know we have fallen because we know who we are.’</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: When were you in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s beside the point. But did they listen
to me? Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You alright, Fay?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No, I’m not alright! Your poem brought my
period on a week and half early! So just shut up. Everybody just shut
up!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For is this not the best of all possible
worlds? Are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos
that could not exist without them?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So, do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah, but when were you in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: At. One. Time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Simon, can I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go ahead. But never let yourself be
flattered.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: So what about this friend of yours, Hot Shot?
The publisher.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Angus James.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah. Angus James. How about sending this poem
to him?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Because it’s not done yet.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: When’s it gunna be done, Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Well, you oughta be home writing instead of
hanging out over here with all your groupies.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hey, I’m not a groupie.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Pardon me, swivel-hips. Is that your
PowerBook?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Can I see it?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The thing to do is to send parts of it to
different magazines and literary journals first. That kinda thing. You
know. Substantiate it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s ‘scatalogical’ mean?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Filth, child. A preoccupation with excrement.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s what the Board of Education called
Simon’s poem, yesterday; scatological.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah, I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write the
human interest column for the Queens County Examiner and I was just
wondering if I could have a word with Simon Grim?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You can’t talk to him for, you know, too long
or anything, ’cause he’s gotta, you know… he writes all day. That’s all
he does. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Hey! Simon! Get down here!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, this is Edna. She’s from the
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Simon, the Parents’ Association at the local
high school are calling your poem pornography. The teachers are
defending the students’ right to exercise their critical tastes and
sensibilities. The county agrees with the Church and considers the poem
emblematic of modern society’s moral disintegration. How do you feel
about these controversial reactions to your poem?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, answer the woman.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I need my prescription filled.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Mom, this is Edna. Edna, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a child?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We all thought he was retarded.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Everyone did.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Never said a word.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He masturbated constantly.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Had no friends.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Till he met Henry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And that’s when all the trouble really
started.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine
consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and
have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing
young talent of the day. Every week we are forced to return writing
which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief
but polite refusal. But this tract you’ve sent us demands a response as
violent as the effect your words have had upon us. Drop dead. Keep your
day job. Sincerely, The Editors.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: De gustibus non disputandum est.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can’t argue with taste?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: About taste. You can’t argue about taste.
God, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The other twenty-five are almost as bad. I
don’t know why I bother.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What do you mean you don’t know why you
bother? You bother because you know the poem is excellent!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Of course you do!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m not so sure sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can you sit there, look me straight in the
eye, and tell me you don’t think this poem is great? That it is not at
once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth? That it is not a
genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of
existence?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I, ah…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So, you see, you have no choice!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Can you recommend it to your friend, the
publisher?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry? Can you recommend the poem to him?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I mean, I think it’s finished and, for better
or worse, it is book length.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That might not be as easy as it seems.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, it’s been a long time. My name might
not carry as much weight as it once did with Angus.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But he’s your friend, right?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We were close at one time.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You said he respected your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Look, Simon, opinions come and go.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: To be honest; my ideas, my writing, they
haven’t always been received well or even calmly. They’re upsetting. I’m
a controversial man.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You see, what I’m doing is too radical. Too
uncompromising. It’ll take time for people to see its value. It’s ahead
of its time, perhaps, or maybe just… A recommendation from me might do
you as much harm as it does good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, why can’t I read the ‘Confession’?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Because certain work needs to be experienced
all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its
character.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, wake up! The guy’s in a dream world!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He’s afraid that his reputation will prevent
people from giving my work an honest chance.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: His reputation as what?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: As a writer.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Gimme a break.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He’s kinda like in exile. Marginalized on
account of his ideas.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: If he’s such a great big fat genius, why
doesn’t he write books? Like you do.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He has. He’s written a book. It’s almost
completed. He’s been working on it for years. It’s just not
published.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah, I bet. It’s probably disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s a quite serious and difficult piece of
work, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Have you read it?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Not yet. Soon. Certain work needs to be
experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of
its character.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah, well, what ever. Listen, Simon, forget
Henry. Go straight up to this Angus James character yourself and make
him read your poem.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m gunna apply for a job at the one- hour
photo joint and then go over to the Mall to see about that job in the
bank. Make sure Mom takes her pills. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Please don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That was nice what you were playing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, it was nice. But it was unremarkable.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. It does.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Simon?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hi, I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Aren’t you the messenger?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Are you here to fix the plumbing?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m here to see Mr. Angus James.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m not a plumber. Or a messenger. I was once
a garbage man. But now I’m a poet.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: The book, as we know it, Angus, will be a
thing of the past within the next few years. Novels, articles,
newspapers will all be downloaded on to our personal computers
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: So you’re telling me to get out of the
publishing business?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No. But we’ve got to re-invent the publishing
business for the electronic age.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Yes, Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, but…
Angus, there’s a particularly wound-up young garbage man out here who
seems to have written a poem. A long poem. And I recall how, at last
month’s meeting, you stressed the need for us to be on the look-out for
more marginalized verse from unestablished quarters of the American
scene.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. You did.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Twice.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Well, OK. Make an appointment, Laura.
Sometime next month.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Right-e-o.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: So, anyway, how is the digital revolution
going to help me sell books?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why can’t I see him now?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Because he’s a very important man and, well,
you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I don’t think people are going to prefer
reading books on television, Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It won’t be television!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’ll be interactive.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Angus, look, we have a number of charts
here…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: In every home in America the PC will be where
the TV used to be.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And it’ll be a direct connection to all forms
of media.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: An unprecedented transformation of American
social life…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’ll all become better informed, more
literate, increasingly productive, and… Well, and, like I said, we have
a number of charts…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Sorry to disturb you again, gentlemen, but…
Angus, I’d like to call security for this one. Though, before I do, I
just wanted to ask just how marginal the as yet undiscovered voice of
American poetry should be?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Pretty damn marginal, I’d think.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Down right controversial, probably.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: How’s he strike you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s been denounced by his local Board of
Education.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Oh, I read about him in the paper. Hangs out
in a delicatessen somewhere and writes pornography.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Hello, and why do you think I should take
valuable time out of my busy schedule to read…</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Because it’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Are you hearing this?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s adorable.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I wouldn’t want to waste your time.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I’m sure you wouldn’t and I appreciate you
being so straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I assume you can take straightforward
criticism?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Just say ‘Yes’.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Get him a coffee, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Have a seat, Mr Grim.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Hold my calls for the next half hour.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What about Steve?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: He doesn’t drink coffee. Steve, do you drink
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Angus, listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: In the infinite amplitude of his love, God
wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist
together in one cosmos… OK.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: In an instantaneous calculation made in
eternity, God computes the best possible world and creates it. Fine.
This ‘decision’ by God is uncontingent and eternal rather than
temporally or ontologically sequential.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How do you spell that?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Ontologically.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: O-N-T… Don’t you have some kinda spell-check
on that thing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It is impossible for every perfect good to be
compatible with every other perfect good. The intense beauty of the
mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The good of freewill must entail real choices
for sin.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Listen, Amy, back off. I’m on parole.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You feel the same way. I can tell. I can see it
when you look at me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey! I don’t look at you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes you do. In the street. In the parking lot
yesterday. That night on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I look at a lot of people that way.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You think I’m stupid.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No, as a matter of fact, I think you’re a
real bright kid and I like that about you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I like it so much I’ve got half a mind to do
perverse things to you. Right here. Right now. Things you might just
learn to like.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: This is really quite unbelievably bad, my
friend. I mean, I’m all for experimentation and I’ve made a career out
of a healthy disregard for convention, but… Look, this is profoundly
irrelevant material. This is only my opinion. But it’s an opinion I
value highly. Goodnight, Laura. Call Norton Press. We’re still on for
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I’ve been wrong before as a publisher. But I
refuse to admit I’ve ever been wrong as a reader. You have talent, I
admit. You have an innate sense of the musicality of language. A good
ear, maybe. But you do nothing significant with it. And this twisted
reasoning that poses as… conviction or insight, it’s… well, it’s
embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Why did you bring this thing to me,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A friend of mine spoke of you. He said you
had a lot of integrity.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Yes, well, of course, I do. But I’m not
crazy, am I? Who is this person? Do I know him?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry Fool.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I remember Henry.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He used to be the janitor here.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Henry, put those magazines back.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m just looking at the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: It’s not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I learn so much from these magazines, Mr
Deng. I refuse to discriminate between modes of knowing.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: And you can’t smoke in here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why not!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: It’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: This place is losing all its charm, Mr
Deng.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Business is good. The kids, they hang out
all day and drink coffee, talk about art and read poetry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s just a fad, Mr Deng. These kids today,
they’re just slaves to fashion.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Anybody home? Mom?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Ma, that you?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, Mr Deng! How much do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That can’t be right! And so what? My credit’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Henry!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of bucks I can
borrow?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Listen, Henry, I wanna remind you to vote
this Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Ah, yes, of course. When noble minds shrink
from the task of leadership scoundrels will rush in to fill the void.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: It’s every American’s right. A blessing. Yet
another opportunity to save America from itself.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Hey, Henry, you in there? Gimme a
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What kind of… Well, I mean… What kind of…
perverse things would you do to me?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Take a powder, cupcake.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Evaporate!</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Let us pray. Lord, grant that peace
be within reach for our friend, Mary. May the pain and confusion she
endured on earth be fought through in the after life, so that she may
enter the Kingdom of Heaven and live in the light of God. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So I was a janitor! So what?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But Angus James said he didn’t even know
you!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, I mean, we weren’t like bosom buddies
or anything. But we used to talk sometimes. In the elevator. In the
morning. He said he liked my ideas. Being a janitor’s a good job if
you’re a writer. Especially the night shift; all that time to think and
develop my ideas.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Anyway, he hated my poem.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, what the hell does he know? He wouldn’t
know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg.
To hell with him! He’s not the only publisher in the world!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But nobody likes it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s true. A prophet is seldom heeded in his
own land. Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, look, treasure!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s a ring. Jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I think it’s a gasket. A fitting from off of
that old refrigerator over there.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering around
by the garbage dump.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He lost.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who lost?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Congressman Feer.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh. Well, you know. Somebody’s gotta
lose.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What’s the fucking use. You make sacrifices.
You try to be a decent human being. Try to contribute something
meaningful to society. And what happens? They lose to a bunch of
cultural elite liberal fuck-ups. I don’t give a shit anymore. People
deserve what they get.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Vicky?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: He’s a good man, Henry. Nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: He’s terribly disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I found Pearl wandering around with no shoes
on her feet.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Thanks. She gets scared.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: I love him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Where’s the beer?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: No more beer. Coffee. Espresso! Cappuccino!
Caf� au lait. Carrot juice. Herbal tea.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A double espresso and a jelly donut, Gnoc.
You mind paying? My credit’s no good here anymore, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Did you go to the employment agency today,
Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No, but it’s OK. Simon’s gunna try to get me
a job on the garbage truck.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Listen, I’m a little concerned about your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in
the library.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Get outta here! When?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It couldn’t have been Simon.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: It almost certainly is. He mentions you.
Look…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: ‘Her figure makes me violent. I want to
somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.’</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Bu�uel, this is obviously a love letter.</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: We’ve had complaints.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: She posted it on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh, the slut!</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: She was trying to warn other girls about a
potential rapist.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is all this true about the Internet? About
how you can get pornography on it?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Well, yeah, sure. It’s a big problem. You
can send dirty pictures and everything.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: On the Internet?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No kiddin’?</p>
<p><strong>bu�uel</strong>: See you on Thursday, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Sure. See you. Gnoc, gimme one of these
double espressos to go, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hello, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You gotta get outta the house, Fay. You can’t
blame yourself for not being here. You did all you could for her.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Is there something you want?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You got the Internet on that contraption?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah. So what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Look Fay, about, you know, between us – what
happened…</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it, Henry!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Type a part of Simon’s poem onto the
Internet.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Because.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come on, Fay. It’s a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I don’t know if he would want us to do
that.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Sure he would. Just the first ten verses.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He’ll thank you for it later.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Henry…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Gimme another one of those tall double
espressos, Mr Deng.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: You gunna buy that?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’m just looking.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Well then put it back.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There’s this fascinating story about a famous
rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in their hotel
room and inserted a live fish into her vagina.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They say she had numerous orgasms.</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Henry, you need to do something with your
life. Get a job, or something.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I mean, it wasn’t the entire fish, it was
just, you know, the nose. The nose of the fish.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You don’t find that interesting?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You ever wonder what it would be like to have
sex with an animal, Mr Deng?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: That coffee is free. Just take it and get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I mean, some dogs are almost as big as people
and often more attractive.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He came by this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did you talk?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You’ve got to tell him, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: He thinks I’m a slut.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon, I don’t feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How many of these did you have?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, we have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can I use your toilet?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fay’s taking a shower.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How much you think I can get for this?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, Fay’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fay’s pregnant with your child.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Jesus, Henry!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Hey, Henry. You OK?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Oh. Oh, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: And do promise before God and these
witnesses…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And do promise before God and these
witnesses…</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: To be your loving and faithful
husband.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: To be your loving and faithful husband.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: In plenty and in want.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: In plenty and in want.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: In joy and in sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: In joy and in sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: In sickness and in health.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: In sickness and in health.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: For as long as we both shall
live.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For as long as we both shall live.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Bless, O Lord, this ring, that he who
gives it and she who wears it may abide in your peace and continue in
your favor until their life’s end.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Whom God has joined, let no man
separate.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon, do something.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s all over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They’re even talking about it on the TV
news.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Simon?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There’s a guy from the radio station over at
World of Donuts and a story in the newspaper about some kids burning
down a school near Boston!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It all started right here in Queens, Jim,
at World of Donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man,
Simon Grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come
to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry – 112 lines of
unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames
of controversy across the nation and – indeed – the world.</p>
<p><strong>owen feer</strong>: This is outrageous! Measures must be
taken. Have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man
with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet,
and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to
turn on a computer? Is this what we have come to? Not the transmission
of our highest ideals, but a cynical, atheistic delirium!</p>
<p><strong>poet laureate</strong>: Poetry of this kind, and this poem in
particular, is, I think, a worthy form of desperation; a digression on
the extremes of human experience; of solitude, of community. It is
perhaps alarming, even upsetting to some – myself included – but it must
be allowed to exist.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope issued
a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed
the godless and lost. He did not mention Simon Grim by name, but offered
a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and
not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music, drugs and
contemporary poetry.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: God, Simon, I mean, like, you’re a total
fucking rock star.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I’m willing to negotiate, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I know, it’s just…</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: You’ve had other offers.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, yes. But.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why have you reconsidered?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Because I think your writing will be
tremendously successful.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But you don’t like it?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: It’s growing on me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What made you change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Other people’s responses. I don’t live in a
vacuum, you know. Two months ago I didn’t have the proof of your poem’s
appeal. Now I do.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Consider my offer carefully. Get some
professional advice. I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: What were the terms?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A hundred thousand in cash up front.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Royalties?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A seventy/thirty split.</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Well, that could be better. But it is
a hundred thousand dollars up front. Guaranteed money. You could use
that.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So it’s a good deal?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: Of course it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So I should take it?</p>
<p><strong>father hawkes</strong>: No. Try to get him up to a hundred
and fifty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ve let myself down, Simon! I’ve let myself
be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity! How did I get here? How
did this happen to me? I’m going to be somebody’s father! I need time to
think. To write. Time to finish my ‘Confession’! I can’t work for a
living! It’s impossible! I tried once. My genius will be wasted trying
to make ends meet!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: This is how great men topple, Simon. Their
hearts are in the right place too much of the time! They get
sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How could I have been so careless!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Henry, please, let me read the
‘Confession’.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No. Not now. It’s not done. I’m all washed
up. I’m finished!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Angus James is convinced my poem is going to
make him incredibly wealthy. He’ll read your book and seriously consider
publishing it. If I ask him to. I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Really? You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ll insist he publish the ‘Confession’.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Or I won’t let him publish my poem.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’d do that? You’d do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do you realize what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I owe you everything.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: It’s really that bad?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: You’ve read this?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: And you want me to consider publishing
it?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: As part of our deal?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Simon, this book, it’s… It’s really quite
bad.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That’s what you said about my poem.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I’m offering you a very real expression of my
faith in your writing. Two hundred thousand dollars and a sixty/forty
split.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But just exactly what is the nature of your
faith in my writing?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Look, Simon, you don’t require my admiration.
You require my experience as a publisher. And that experience leads me
to believe your poem will make more money than any book of poetry ever
published. In history. Virtually make you a household name within two
years. You’ll never have to work on a garbage truck again, I assure you.
Or do anything else for that matter. Whereas this ‘Confession’ by Henry
Fool…</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: The most I can say for this is… The man is a
scoundrel.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He taught me everything I know.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: No! He encouraged all that was expressive in
you to become manifest. He inspired you to act. He influenced your
perception.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How about if my advance is only a hundred
thousand?</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: It’s not about money, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We could split the royalties
seventy/thirty.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: I will not publish Henry Fool’s
‘Confession’.</p>
<p><strong>angus</strong>: Will you sign the contract?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Simon? You’re here.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And Fay?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: She’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Listen, Henry, Angus James didn’t like your
‘Confession’.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Ah. I see. Well, what now?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Did he suggest changes?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. He didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I mean, after all, there are things I can do
to make it more accessible.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Accessible?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I can soften up some of the language and make
it read easier. Take out some of the more intratextual references and
popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang, so to speak. I can change its
mode. Make it more of a conventional novel instead.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh, Simon, don’t be such a purist! I
appreciate your protectiveness, but the integrity of the work gives it a
durability that can sustain such things.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Really, Henry. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are you saying; that it doesn’t merit
revision?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m saying… Angus James didn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, did you tell him what you think?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What I think doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes, it does. You’ve got to use your
influence with him.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I gave it to him to read and he hated it.
What more can I do?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You can refuse to let him publish your
poem.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You said you would.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That was before I read your book.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I signed the contract, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, Henry, what did you expect?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I… I don’t know. Honesty, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, if I had told you, when at first I read
it, that I thought it was no good, what would you have done?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I would have respected your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And insisted that there’s no accounting for
taste.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, is there?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I don’t know. I didn’t bring it to Angus
because I thought it was good. I brought it to Angus because you’re my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh how perfectly enormous of you, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, Henry, I did it! I wrote. I wrote
poetry because you told me to! I worked! I worked while you sat back and
comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow, stupid and mean
to appreciate your ideas.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is that such a priority? Is that some sort of
measure of a man’s worth? To drag what’s best in him out into the street
so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a
stick?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Maybe. Maybe it is.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You must be pretty impressed with yourself,
huh? The all too obviously talented new man, the important new voice,
the early clue to a new direction, or whatever, etc., etc., etc! A
popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd!
You want to be liked more than you know, Simon Grim! You’d be nowhere
without me and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes. It’s time you left.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I saw you for what you were in the beginning,
Simon. I hold no grudge and I’m certain you will, in time, leave some
serious and small dent in this world.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The world is full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The world is full of shit. It’s true. And you
have to walk through it. That’s your part. I’m sorry. But you’re no good
at it. Perhaps I’m not. Perhaps I wasn’t made to walk through shit. Go
on now. Leave. Do what you’re good at. Go.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Play!</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Henry, what did I tell you about bringing the
kid in here!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Say hello to Patty, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: How you doin’, sweetie? You wanna Coke?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So what did you learn at school today, Ned?
Anything?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Here, I’ll teach you something.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Horrible, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: It burns.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: See. That’ll teach ya. Here, sip this.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Ned!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Ned!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’m warning you, Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s it. That’s it. Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Fool, it’s about your friend – what’s his
name. Your brother-in- law.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The controversial and reclusive American poet
Simon Grim has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish
Academy, who will confer the award late next week, praised Mr Grim for
works of great and difficult striving, for the rendering of the
desperate, the ugly and the mundane in a language packed with our shared
human frailties…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: God, they must be hard up for geniuses to pin
medals on because, listen, I gotta tell you, when I first met this guy
he didn’t even know what an iambic pentameter was.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s a fraud.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Keep a lid on it, Bill, you’re outta your
league.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Stir things up so as to stay in the
newspapers. That’s his racket.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: He’s a great American poet, you dumb
fuck!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Poet, my ass! I could puke all over a piece a
loose leaf and be more profound than he is!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come over here and say that and I’ll cripple
ya in three different ways, you boozed-up Philistine!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Henry!</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Listen, you degenerate, I’ve had about enough
of this! Ned, have you been drinking?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: His throat hurt from smoking.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Henry, don’t come home tonight! I’m warning
you! Don’t come home at all! Ever!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who’s winning?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: We gotta have rock ‘n’ roll shows these
days, Henry. The poetry readings just don’t pay the bills no more.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What did I tell you! It was just a fad. I
told you that! I told everyone!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Did you hear about Simon? It was on the
news today.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel Prize.
Anybody can get one of them these days. That’s the problem, with this
world, Mr Deng… Nobody’s got any standards anymore. You seen Fay?</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: You better sleep in my office tonight,
Henry. She was very angry. You’ve gotta let her cool off.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I can’t sleep in there with that racket!</p>
<p><strong>mr deng</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What are you doing here, Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Some what?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Come sit here.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: That’s what my dad always says.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: ‘You want some?’</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: People say you were once in jail for having
sex with a girl my age.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You oughta get outta here, Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I was here first.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You go home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I can’t go home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: He beat her up again.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Warren beat up your mom?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Do you think I’m pretty?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Does she need help?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I’ll suck your cock if you kill him for
me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Vicky! Vicky, it’s Henry from across the
street! Vicky!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Vicky?</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, you
idiot!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s about Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>vicky</strong>: Mind your own business, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Yeah, who the hell do you think you are,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: It is true your husband served seven years
in prison for statutory rape.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: And when was that?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: That was… I dunno. Fifteen… Sixteen years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: And when were you married?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: We were married seven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Were you aware at all of the victim’s
relationship with his daughter?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The girl, the daughter, Pearl. She had been
having sexual relations with her father.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I didn’t know that. No.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Pearl claims she offered your husband sexual
favors if he would kill her father.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I’m just repeating what she said, Mrs Fool.
The victim’s wife, Vicky, claims your husband broke into the house and
forcefully entered her bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Fay, I know this isn’t easy. But we need
your help here. The girl claims she asked your husband to kill her
father in exchange for, well, I guess the promise of sexual relations
with her.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I don’t know, honey. Leave me alone a minute, I
gotta think.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Is Dad in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yes, Ned, he is. He’s in big trouble. Now just
be quiet for two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I’m warning you, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Mom, can I be a mailman when I grow up?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Sure you can, honey. You can be anything you
want.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Yeah, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: My uncle.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Simon Grim.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: There ain’t no one here by that name.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Room 423.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: This is post marked five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: What does he look like?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Sorry, kid. Can’t help ya.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Get up off your knees.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Promise me you’ll be on that plane at seven,
Simon.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ll see you in Stockholm.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Look, Simon, the world’s a scary place. I
admit it. But it’s not my fault. I swear!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m sorry, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Don’t be. You had things to do.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So did you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Gotta light?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Take care of your mom and don’t start trouble
you can’t finish.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I love you, Fay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Yeah, well, tough.</p>

way, Mr Grim! This way! Excuse me!</p>
