<p><strong>int. pentagon - situation room - night</strong>: Temple sits
with the Joint Chiefs, White House Chief of Staff, the Directors of the
N.A.S.A., C.I.A., etc.</p>
<p>****: In it’s simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one
mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force of all
the nuclear weapons in the world, times a thousand. Half our population
will die within 24 hours from tidal waves and heat pulses. The other
half won’t be so lucky. In the end, it will be men eating the flesh of
other men. It’s not the end of the world, General, the world - Earth -
will still be here. But there will be no life - maybe cockroaches and
some resilient strands of bacteria. Temple Well, that’s really positive,
Dan. The President just got off the phone with the Russians. They’re
just about to launch a new Mars Probe on the biggest rocket in the
world. Golden and the N.A.S.A. BRASS exchange sceptical looks.</p>
<p>****: With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe
in ’96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa. Temple They’re going to
pull off the probe and replace it with four Atlas Class IV nuclear
warheads. Enough punch in their opinion - not to break it up - but to
slow it down enough to miss Earth’s orbit.</p>
<p>****: Their launch date is set for next month. Temple They’re going
to move it up.</p>
<p>****: To when? Temple Sixteen hours from now.</p>
<p>****: What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it
together? Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear
detonation is not going to work. The only way is to split the thing in
half and hope the two pieces slide past us. Temple Thank you for
bringing up the impossible, Dan.</p>
<p>****: Well, this has been a tough day. The media’s all over this.
They’re going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be dead in
eighteen days achieves nothing but panic. Golden</p>
<p>****: Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard
thing to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only
twelve telescopes powerful enough to see it right now. You’ve got a full
moon goin’ for four days - makes it all but impossible to see.. Once
these things draw closer to Earth, you’ll never keep a lid on this. No
way.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. briefing room - night</strong>: The video
screen blinks off. Golden looks at his Techs.</p>

our enemy. This is like the race to the Moon, guys - what this Agency
was founded on.</p>
<p><strong>super - day two</strong>: Close on a GOLF BALL. THWACK! The
golf ball EXPLODES off the tee from an oil rig. The “TROLL” is the
largest man-made structure in the world - 12 aircraft carriers big and
1200 feet tall. A self-contained city.</p>
<p><strong>ext. “troll” - drilling platform - “a” derrick -
day</strong>: The main drilling platform. On “A” derrick, Chief Driller,
A.J. FROST, 30, handsome, is at the controls. Roughnecks “JIMBO”
CARTWRIGHT, “BEAR” BROWN, “CHICK” CHAPPLE, TITO GUEVARA, and MAX LOGAN,

ball. WE REVEAL his target, a GREENPEACE BOAT anchored off the rig. The
BALL strikes the side of the boat, just missing the head of ONE of the
PROTESTERS.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.?</strong>: Suddenly, across “A” Derrick, a KLAXON
SOUNDS.</p>
<p><strong>now, not tomorrow.</strong>: CHick and Bennie begin clamping,
and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the DRILL STRING like an INDY PIT STOP
CREW.</p>

platform shakes and shudders. SEAWATER erupts from the wellhead.</p>
<p><strong>int. drilling hole</strong>: A.J. is pinned against the hole
wall by one of the disconnected pipes. Harry comes down the hole. He
plants his back against the hole wall and kicks the pipe, freeing A.J. A
slow, deep, RUMBLE emanates from below. The Briny water inside the hole
suddenly turns BLACK and VISCOUS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. drilling platform - “a” derrick - day</strong>: – the
wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently. The derrick
sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Grace Never do that again!</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Good plan, Harry. Harry There’s your oil,
gentlemen. Now get the hell off my rig.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. - mission control - day</strong>: Golden,
Clark, Skip, Flip and the rest of the Mission Control Technicians watch

the men. She comes to Tito. He grabs her arm. Takes the scissors from
her.</p>
<p><strong>int. johnson space center - psychological testing center -
day</strong>: Chick sits before a hugely endowed but square female

mountains standing before hi, and then at the tiny EMU suit. Alterations
will be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>int. johnson center - astronaut training - morning</strong>:
Clark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp, Truman,
CO-PILOTS MEGAN WATTS and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with
N.A.S.A. Engineers JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS. Clark United States
astronauts train for eighteen months. You have nine days. Officers
Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are your military instructors and the
only pilots to have flown the spacecraft. Each is a combat decorated
officer and among the finest men and women we have in the service. Pay
attention to them. Sharp We spend six months on emergency training -
we’re throwing that out. If we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That’s a
heavy load but it’s ours to carry. The purpose of this is to train you
in the physical and mental rigors of working in a weightless enviroment
so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs. You will vomit.
Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your heads. You’ll be so tired
you can’t eat but that won’t matter ’cause you’ll be so sore you can’t
take a dump. By the way…good morning.</p>
<p><strong>int. neutral buoyancy tank - day</strong>: Splash, Splash.

on a new length of drill pipe. Chick engages the gears. The drill pipe
descends. THE TERMINATOR is working. Harry approaches from the
shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom - drill site</strong>: Chick, Bear and Max
listen to Harry over the inter-crew link.</p>
<p><strong>int. freedom</strong>: Harry Why don’t we cut to the chase,
fellahs? What the fuck is going on with that other nuke?</p>
<p><strong>int. mission control</strong>: Golden and Clark are hunched
over monitors. Two MILITARY AIDES carrying a NUCLEAR COMMAND LINK</p>
<p><strong>suitcase.</strong>: Golden, alarmed, tries to figure out what
they have.</p>
<p><strong>int. shuttle freedom</strong>: Chick, Bear and Max enter
through the airlock. Everyone turns and stares at Sharp.</p>

on up there? Temple Your drillers aren’t doing the job, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>int. independence - crash site</strong>: Lev is sitting on
the ground, head in his hands, completely demoralised.</p>
<p><strong>ext. independence - wreckage of cargo bay</strong>: Lev is
prying open the cargo bay ramp door .</p>
<p><strong>int. - mission control</strong>: Golden turns to Temple.</p>
<p><strong>ext. independence - wreckage of cargo bay</strong>: The
Armadillo, engine rumbling, is poised to roll Independence’s long
tubular NUCLEAR WEAPON which has been ejected with other debris from the
broken fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>int. mission control</strong>: Temple Golden, tell your
drillers the clock is ticking. I have 6 billion people down here relying
on them!</p>
<p><strong>int. independence - crash site</strong>: The ARMADILLO blasts
through the cargo bay door. A.J. and Lev roll off away from the
Independence.</p>
<p><strong>int. shuttle freedom</strong>: Sharp comes back from the
cockpit, carrying the detonator. Harry’s on the phone to Golden.</p>
<p>****: Firmly. Harry Great. Glad we have that understanding.</p>
<p>****: IF you’re gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk
about time…and temperature. Zero Barrier’s in two hours. Harry
Wait…wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures come into the
picture?</p>
<p>****: Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius…. Harry
And…? How hot is it going to get?</p>
<p>****: We didn’t anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The
clock is ticking… Harry How hot is it going to get?!</p>
<p>****: Three hundred and fifty degrees. Harry’s face drops.</p>
<p><strong>int. freedom - cargo bay</strong>: Harry clicks off the
radio.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shuttle frredom</strong>: The airlock opens. Sharp and
Pitts are led out by Harry.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom drill site - minutes later</strong>: The SECOND
ARMADILLO rumbles out of Freedom’s cargo bay. Chick and the Roughnecks
work like a NASCAR pit crew. Sharp and Pitts lay on their backs holding
down a 1000 pound axle, fighting zero-g.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - front of “three spires
ridge”</strong>: A.J.’s ARMADILLO rumbles over a little hill revealing
the RIDGE WTH THREE SPIRES directly in front of them. THE SUN is moving
over the asteroid’s FAR HORIZON, causing a “sunrise.” It is
breathtaking, spiritual…and frighteningly bright.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: A.J. Over the hill.</p>
<p><strong>int. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: Here, too,
the ground shakes. Bear, terrified, drops a DRILL PIPE. Max is shaken to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: The asteroid shakes
violently, throwing A.J. and Lev around the cab. ROCKS BANK down on the
Armadillo’s top and hood. The ASTEROID SURFACE continues splitting apart
across the slope’s fall line.</p>
<p><strong>a.j. earthquake!</strong>: The asteroid RUMBLES a few more
seconds, then the quake slowly stops. All is stll.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface</strong>: Lev gets out; he nervously
paces back and forth across the lip of the fissure.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: This outta cut into a sweet wedding ring. Lev
With this I can rebuild my MIR.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: Chick, Bear,
and Max cautiously approach the drill hole. Everything seems okay. Chick
climbs back up to the drill-drive platform.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - “three spires ridge”</strong>: A.J.
is walking along the GAPING, JAGGED FISSURE, 50 feet wide, 50 feet deep,
stretching across the entire slope.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Hop on the back. Get our weight distributed
better. Lev And why to do this? A.J. Because I’m askin’. And turn your
suit’s thrusters off. Trust me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: A.J. throws it in neutral.
The Armadillo stops.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j..’s armadillo - back bumper</strong>: The
Armadillo’s REAR TIRES CHURN FORWARD, slinging rocks and gravel which,
in zero-g, shoot off in a stream into space, never falling. Lev holds on
for dear life.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: – A.J. punches the
Armadillo’s PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER “OFF”</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j.’s armadillo - roof</strong>: – the Armadillo’s
roof-mounted PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS shut down.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid - “three spires ridge” - jagged
fissure</strong>: The Armadillo, no longer thrusting downwardly, flies
across the jagged fissure in zero-g. The heavy steel vehicle doesn’t
fall. It ascends, and amazingly, shoots across the entire 50 foot
expanse of jagged fissure.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j.’s armadillo - back bumper</strong>: Lev looks down.
The FISSURE passes beneath him, then SOLID GROUND again. They’ve cleared
the fissure….but they’re not coming down.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: A.J. punches the PRO-GRAVITY
THRUSTER “START” SWITCH. Nothing….</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j.’s armadillo - back bumper</strong>: The thruster
nozzles SPUTTER, but no thrust. The Armadillo is 50 feet off the ground
and still ascending…into outer space. Lev, his next stop being Planet
Mars, panics. He climbs the roof and peers inside the front windshield,
POUNDING ON THE WINDSHIELD.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: The Armadillo continues
lifting into space, from which there is no return. A.J. toggles the
“start” switch. The swtich’s</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: Not quite. Only the
right-front and right-rear THRUSTER NOZZLES fire, pushing the right side
downward, rolling the Armadillo over on its side. Lev, on the bumper,
clings to the rear-mounted</p>
<p><strong>tow winch and cable assembly.</strong>: Suspended in zero-g,
on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is pushed by thrusters,
tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE CLIFF FACE next to the slope.
All four Armadillo tires slam against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces
off.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: A.J., lying sideways, keeps
toggling the thruster START SWITCH. The indicator light finally FLASHES
“IN” and A.J. rams it into drive –</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - cliff face / armadillo</strong>: –
the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways across
the cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the cliff face and
gradually falls, until he’s bouncing on the asteroid surface.</p>
<p><strong>int. a.j.’s armadillo</strong>: A.J., shaken, takes a deep
breath and gets out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. a.j.’s armadillo - rear</strong>: A.J. walks to the
rear. Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of the Armadillo, covered in
asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks up at him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom - drilling site</strong>: Harry orders his crew
to start the drill up. The men drill a shitload of feet in record time.
They finally burst through the rock and hit easy sediment.</p>

Bear yank the detached good TRANSMISSION HOUSING from inside Armadillo 2
and carry it across to Armadillo 1.</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo 1 - cabin</strong>: Max finishes unbolting the
BROKEN TRANSMISSION HOUSING. He passes it to Chick who dumps it on the
surface. Sharp and Truman work with Bear and Chick who feed in the good
transmission housing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. armadillo 1</strong>: Chick and Bear, atop the drilling
platform, begin installing the clutch plates and transmission
linkage.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. - mission control - day</strong>: Skip is
analysing the asteroid’s THERMAL READINGS. A MULTI- COLORED THERMAL
IMAGE MAP shows most of the asteroid is GREEN , but around the chosen
landing site are numerous RED SPOTS . Skip Look at these thermals. This
is BEFORE sunlight hits the drill site. She’s really heating up….</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo</strong>: Max is bolting. The DOWNHOLE
PRESSURE GAUGE NEEDLE jolts. Max doesn’t see it. He keeps working.</p>
<p><strong>ext. drilling site</strong>: Harry’s watching the work. Out
of the corner of his eye… THE DRILLING ARM KICKS. Harry turns to it.
Nothing happens. His eyes move back to Chick and Bear, then back to the
drilling arm. It kicks up again. Just a few inches.</p>
<p><strong>men!!</strong>: Harry climbs up to the DRILL PLATFORM. The
GROUND SHAKES violently, throwing harry and Chick around the top of the
drill platform.</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo - rear compartment</strong>: Max is furiously
unbolting the TRANNY HOUSING. There are two bolts to go. He ratches one
off….</p>
<p>****: Go Max, go Max, get the last bolt….! Max gets the last bolt
undone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. armadillo - drill platform</strong>: Chick and Harry
pull the unfastened TRANNY HOUSING out of the Armadillo as –</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo - rear compartment</strong>: Max stares at the
DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGES, groping through the compartment for his
helmet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: Suddenly the
DRILLING ARM jolts upward, lifting the ARMADILLO SIX FEET off the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo - rear compartment</strong>: Max is thrown
against a wall of the rear compartment.</p>

against the wall again. Terrified, he grabs for his helmet and locks the
NECK SEALS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: A DEEP
RUMBLING emanates from the drilling hole, coming seemingly from the
ASTEROID’S CORE. Harry gets to his feet and SLAMS HIS FIST against the
Armadillo’s SIDE.</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo - rear compartment</strong>: Max, helmet on,
is frantically scrambling to the airlock, but there’s no time…</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: WIth an
awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE EXPLODES
upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE ARMADILLO VEHICLE with
it. THE ENTIRE RIG blows upward into space.</p>
<p><strong>int. armadillo - rear compartment</strong>: Max punches the
DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is sucked violently out
of the rear compartment into open space.</p>
<p><strong>ext. space over asteroid surface</strong>: FIFTY FEET OF
DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire ARMADILLO RIG with MAX
trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX’S FACE is a screaming mask of terror and
confusion, reaching out, but there’s no one to catch him….Harry and the
guys watch in helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into
space.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. - mission control - day</strong>: Skip motions
to Golden. He comes over.</p>
<p><strong>minutes to go.</strong>: Golden Say nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom - drilling site</strong>: Silence. A stark
tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just watching. Devastated,
confused, in shock. This is a total catastrophe. The mission is
over.</p>
<p><strong>harry chick…bear!!!</strong>: Chick and Bear about ready to
enter the Freedom’s airlock, stop and turn. They see A.J.’S ARMADILLO
ROARING down the hillside onto the drilling site.</p>
<p><strong>ext. freedom - drilling site</strong>: A.J. and Lev roar up
to the drilling site in the Independence’s Armadillo. They come down a
hill spectacularly without brakes and it piles into shit, knocking
things down.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. - mission control - day</strong>: Golden stares
at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the corner.</p>
<p>****: We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up.
No other survivors. Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shuttle freedom - afternoon</strong>: Chick shuts off an
ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view a DRILL BIT with A.J.’S
DIAMONDS mounted on the top like diamonds in a ring setting. Harry and
the guys smile.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: The NEWLY
CREATED DRILL BIT lowers into the drilling hole and begins turning. It
CHEWS into the shit down below, WHIRRING and RIPPING and……descends
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>begin montage</strong>: The men drill a shitload of feet in
very little time. It is a feverish pace, their teamwork perfectly timed,
as if choreographed.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: –A.J. working the levers on the drill
platform.</p>
<p><strong>int. mission control</strong>: Skip looks at thermal readings
with alarm.</p>

hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium, probably water vapor.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: The DRILL
PIPE turns sloely, retracting from the hole. Bear, atop the drilling
platform, is working on something with a wrench.</p>
<p><strong>in half.</strong>: Tito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all
color. Harry approaches the hole. Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS
OF MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole.</p>
<p><strong>int. n.a.s.a. - mission control - day</strong>: Golden
continues looking at the THERMAL IMAGING.</p>
<p><strong>ext. asteroid surface - drilling site</strong>: Harry Well,

gotta go down there. Chick Don’t look at me.</p>
<p><strong>a.j.</strong>: Maybe I’ll ask her again later…. Harry turns
around..looking up at the star-filled sky. A.J. walks over to
Sharp…who’s coming to now.</p>
<p>****: Go ahead, Harry. Harry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty
shot from a drill string….</p>
<p><strong>int. drilling hole</strong>: A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER,
comes down the hole with a HAND- HELD CUTTER and a LENGTH OF ROPE. He
reaches the obstruction. The DRILL PIPE has been mashed, bent, buckled.
Severed ends stab into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting with
the hand- held cutter.</p>
<p><strong>ext. drilling hole</strong>: The guys stand there, watching.
Nothing happens. Agonising seconds pass. Suddenly the ground rumbles.
Another EARTHQUAKE. It slowly starts to subside.</p>
<p><strong>int. drilling hole</strong>: The hole shakes. A.J. freezes,
sweating.</p>
<p>****: A.J., we need you. I need everything you got. A.J. wrestles
with the severed pipes, untangling them, tying the ROPE to them. He
gives the rope a tug. Chick and Bear, above, pull up the broken
pipes.</p>
