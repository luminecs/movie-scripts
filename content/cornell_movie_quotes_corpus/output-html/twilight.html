<p><strong>shooting draft</strong>: February 11, 2008</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’d never given much thought to how I would
die..</p>
<p><strong>blonde #1</strong>: Bye, Bella!</p>
<p><strong>blonde #</strong>: Good luck at your new school!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Have a good..</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … life.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: It won’t work again, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You put it on hold.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Look. You also called Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I’ll figure it out. You gotta be able to reach
me and Phil on the road -</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: love saying that - on the road.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Very romantic.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and
ballpark hot dogs romantic.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Now, you know if you change your mind, I’ll
race back here from wherever the game is.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I won’t change my mind, mom.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You might. You’ve always hated Forks.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s not about Forks, it’s about Dad. I mean,
two weeks a year, we barely know each other.</p>
<p><strong>3 bella’s pov out the car window - scottsdale</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>pull up and out of the car until we’re -</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. above scottsdale - day</strong>: 4</p>
<p><strong>6 int. police cruiser - day - waiting at light</strong>:
6</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your hair’s longer.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I cut it since last time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Guess it grew out again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’s your mom?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. forks, washington - day</strong>: 7</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. charlie’s house - day</strong>: 8</p>
<p><strong>9 int. charlie’s house - day</strong>: 9</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s right. One bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll just put these up in your room -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I can do it -</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bella, you remember Billy Black.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Glad you’re finally here. Charlie hasn’t shut
up about it since you told him you were coming.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Keep exaggerating, I’ll wheel you down the
hill.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right after I ram you in the ankles.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m Jacob. We made mud pies together when we
were little kids.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yeah… I think I remember.. . Are they always
like this?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s getting worse with old age.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So what do you think of your homecoming
gift?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No way. The truck is for me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just bought it off Billy, here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I rebuilt the engine and - -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s perfect!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch
when you shift, but - -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Maybe I can give you a ride to school.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I go to school on the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Too bad. Would’ve been nice to know at least
one person.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I’m
Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide,
lunch date, shoulder to cry on.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m kind of the �suffer in silence� type.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Good headline for your feature - I’m on the
paper, and you’re news, baby, front page.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I – no, I’m not news – I’m, seriously, not at
all -</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Whoa, chillax. No feature.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’ve missed a lot of the semester, but I can
hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse.. .</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s only a flesh wound.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You’re Isabella, right?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Just Bella.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m Mike. Newton.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: She’s got a great spike, doesn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s why they kicked me out.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mike, you met my home girl Bella.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Your home girl?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Sorry, needed a candid for the feature -</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Feature’s dead, Angela. Don’t bring it up
again.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Sorry. There’s always eating disorders, or
Speedo padding on the swim team -</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: – Wait, that’s a good one.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: The Cullens.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Doctor and Mrs. Cullen’s foster kids. They
all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: They kinda keep to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Because they’re all together. Like,
together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired
guy, Emmett.. .</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: … they’re a thing. I’m not even sure that’s
legal.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Jess, they’re not actually related.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: But they live together. And the little dark
haired girl, Alice, she’s really weird.. .</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: … she’s with Jasper, the blonde who looks
like he’s in pain.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: mean, Dr. Cullen’s like this foster dad slash
match maker.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Maybe he’ll adopt me.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s Edward Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s totally gorgeous, obviously. But
apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I wasn’t planning on it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best
you can till you get caught up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: We’re going to cut them in half, then
watch them regenerate into two separate worms.. .</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: … Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just
won’t die.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll just… endure it.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Jerk.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the
air and out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is
choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING.. .</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears
behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella -</p>
<p><strong>waylon</strong>: �Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Waylon, she hasn’t had a Christmas here
since she was four.</p>
<p><strong>waylon</strong>: Bet I made an impression, though.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You always do.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’d be great, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So… you eat here every night?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Easier than washing dishes.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I can cook.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom’s
not great in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I remember.. .</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How was school? Meet anyone?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: A few people… Do you know the Cullen
family?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are people talking about them again?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No… well, a little.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just �cause they’re newcomers. We’re lucky
to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife
wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren’t like a lot of the
hell-raisers around here.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … Okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I just don’t like narrow mindedness.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: If spring training goes well, we could be
living in Florida permanently.</p>
<p><strong>telephone operator</strong>: Please insert 25 cents to
continue.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Mom, where’s your cell?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Ok, I didn’t lose my power cord. It ran away.
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.</p>
<p><strong>flash pop to -edward’s face, his coal black eyes, the
fury..</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>32 int. charlie’s house - living room - morning 32</strong>:
It’s neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella’s given it her
touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie’s fleece jacket,
straightening up. She grabs her book bag -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Dad, I’m heading out.</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. charlie’s house - morning 33</strong>: ON BELLA’S
FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It’s pouring
down rain –the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers,
wraps her coat tight.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie
pulls in -driving her truck.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Dad, I can drive myself to school.</p>
<p><strong>unknown pov - from the trees</strong>: –tracking Bella’s
every move as she slips and falls on a</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You okay, Bells?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Ice doesn’t help the uncoordinated.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s why I got you new tires. She looks
over at the truck – yep, four new tires.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You got me new tires. No one’s ever done that
before.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I mean… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll be late for dinner. I’m heading down
to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some
kind of animal.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: An animal?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re not in Phoenix any more, honey.
They’ve been hunting it for a week with no luck. Thought I’d lend a
hand.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Always am.</p>
<p><strong>back on bella..</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And thank you. For the tires.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: … and yeah, prom committee is a chick thing,
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help
choose the music - - So I need your play list -</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Come on, Arizona. Give it up for the rain.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I didn’t have a chance to introduce myself
last week. My name is Edward Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … You’re Bella.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m… yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: Come on, people. Tick tock.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ladies first.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You’ve been gone.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Out of town. For personal reasons.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Prophase.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: May I look?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Prophase.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Enjoying the rain?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Seriously? You’re asking me about the
weather?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It appears.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No. I don’t like the cold. Or the wet. Or the
gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s complicated.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think I can keep up.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: My mother remarried.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Very complex. So you don’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice
enough.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But now you’re unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No… I – I just.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Did you get contacts?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … no.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s just the fluorescents.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bells. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m fine, dad. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s okay, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It sure as hell is not okay.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Dad, it’s not his fault-</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We nearly lost you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: But you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can kiss your license goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: I heard the Chief’s daughter was
here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good. Dr. Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: I’ve got this one, Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: You have a nice knot growing back there,
but your x-rays show no indication of concussion.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m so sorry, Bella. I’m really -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It would have been a lot worse if Edward
hadn’t knocked me out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Edward? Your boy?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was
nowhere near me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: As long as you’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I just have to sign some paperwork. You
better call your mom.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You told her?! She’s probably freaking.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: This isn’t just about you, it’s about all
of us - -</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Let’s take this in my office.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Can I talk to you for a moment? How did you
get over to me so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was standing right next to you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You were next to your car, across the
lot.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yes. You were.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re confused. You hit your head.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I know what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And what, exactly, was that?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You stopped that van. You pushed it away.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No one will believe that.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I wasn’t planning to tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I just want to know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Can’t you just thank me and get over it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re not going to let it go, are you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Why did you even bother?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That was the first night I dreamed of Edward
Cullen.. .</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: Make sure I get your permission
slips.</p>
<p><strong>flash pop to the van reeling right for her</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>flash pop to edward’s hands stopping the van</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>flash pop to edward on top of her, the proximity,
electricity</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Look! You’re moving. You’re ALIVE!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … Yeah, false alarm.. .</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Actually, I’m glad you’re not dead �cause -
well, that would suck, plus</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: wanted to ask you - even though it’s, like, a
month away.. .</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: So what do you think? You want to go? To prom.
With me.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You can’t go another weekend?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask
Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>mr. molina</strong>: …c’mon, Eric, stuff that compost down
deep… that’s it.. . … now Tyler, take a big steaming cup of �compost
tea.� This is recycling at its most basic level - - hey, don’t drink
that!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Hello, Edward.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s in Jacksonville?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How did you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You haven’t answered any of mine. You won’t
even say hello.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And how did you stop that van?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It helps if you actually watch where you put
your feet.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I know I’ve been rude, but it’s for the
best.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Guess who just asked me to prom!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I totally thought Mike was going to ask
you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great
together.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I know, right?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bella, it would be better if we weren’t
friends.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You think I regret saving you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I know you do.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The bus is leaving. Hi. Will you be riding
with us?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. Our bus is full.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your mother called. Again.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Your fault, for telling her about the
accident.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She always did know how to worry.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: La Push, baby. You in?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Should I know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We’re
all going after school. Big swell coming in.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: And I don’t just surf the internet.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Eric, you stood up once. On a foam
board.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: There’s whale watching, too. Come with.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: La Push, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’ll go if you stop saying that.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Edible art.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Thanks… but your mood swings are giving me
whiplash.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I said it would be better if we weren’t
friends, not that I didn’t want to be.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What does that even mean?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It means if you were smart, you’d avoid
me.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So let’s say, for argument’s sake, that I’m
not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Probably not. I’d rather hear your
theories.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Okay… how �bout radioactive spiders?
Kryptonite?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No. I don’t believe that. You’re not bad. You
can be a jerk, but it’s like this… mask. To keep people away.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Look, why don’t we just - hang out. Like…
come to the beach with us. It’ll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt
water stinging your eyes.. .</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Which beach?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: La Push.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Is something wrong with that beach?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s just a little crowded.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I keep thinking Eric’s going to ask me to
prom, then he just… doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You could ask him.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Bella!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You’re on my rez, remember? You surfing?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Keep her company. Her date bailed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What date?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: She invited Edward.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: To be polite.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I think it’s nice she invited him. No one
ever does.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Because Cullen’s a freak.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You know them?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The Cullens don’t come here.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You want to go look at tide pools?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So, what did your friend mean about the
Cullens not coming here?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oops. Caught that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not supposed to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I can keep a secret.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Like fur, fangs … doggy breath?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So the legend about the Cullens is.. .</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Well, they’re supposedly descended from this,
like.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Didn’t they just move here?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Or just moved back.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Riiiight. So what was this treaty?</p>
<p><strong>aaaaaaaagh!!!!!!</strong>: !</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Wait… what were they really?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s just a story, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>waylon</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>waylon</strong>: Come on, Jerry, you old mutt.. .</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a
deep, sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements
are always on the edge of a crouch.</p>
<p><strong>waylon</strong>: H-how did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Always the same inane questions.. .</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: �What do you want? �</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: �Why are you doing this? �</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: … James, must we?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The question should be, �will it hurt? �</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: They just… ditch?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m going to the prom with Eric!</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: just asked him, I took control!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s a family thing.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in
Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Port Angeles?.. . Can I go with you guys?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thank God. We need your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I think this halter makes my boobs look
big. What do you think, Bella?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Bella?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It looks great.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You said that about the last five
dresses.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’re not very good at this, are you?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>frat boy #</strong>: 1 Wanna beer?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Look, just take my bag.</p>
<p><strong>frat boy #</strong>: 2 We don’t want your bag.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What – no, how did you find – ?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I should go back and rip their heads
off.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No. Bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You don’t know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And you do?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not hard to guess.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Where were you!? We left you a message.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: We waited, but we were starving -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into
each other and got talking.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I - we - understand. We were just… leaving,
so -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Okay, well. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: That’s so… thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Really thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I could eat.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You’re not eating?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m on a special diet.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Like South Beach?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So how �bout some answers?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1
point 772453851.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I didn’t ask for the square root of pi.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You knew that?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How did you know where I was?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Were you following me?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I feel very protective of you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So that’s a yes?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my
distance…until you needed help.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You said before… That you heard what those
guys were thinking.. . Can you… read minds?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have no idea. I can read every mind in
there, except yours.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Why, what’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I tell you I read minds and you think
there’s something wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I… don’t have the strength to stay away from
you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward, you don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re cold. We should go.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I think I’m warm enough now.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Your hand, it’s still freezing cold.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s my father’s car. What’s he – ?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Carlisle. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Waylon Forge was found in the woods out
near his place. I just examined the body.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He died? How?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Animal attack.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: The same kind that killed the security guard
down in Mason?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Most likely.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So it’s getting closer to town.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Waylon lived all the way down on Queets
River. 75 miles south.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: But that’s -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Dad, I’m sorry about Waylon.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Known him going on thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’ll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But
in the meantime.. .</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … I want you to have this.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s probably not a good -</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’ll give me some peace of mind.</p>

<p><strong>but now it’s edward biting bella’s neck, blood
dripping</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … it’s not possible.. . Off BELLA’S FACE,
struggling to make sense of it all.. .</p>
<p><strong>ext. school -lawn -on bella’s face -dawn –thick fog
67</strong>: She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn. Her
expression tells us she’s still reeling with disbelief. STAY</p>
<p><strong>bella’s pov - edward and his siblings</strong>: – cross the
lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees the intensity on her
face. He stops.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Edward, don’t go. But Alice gently removes
Rosalie’s hand from his arm.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s already there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest - day 68</strong>: Bella stands amid the trees,
waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is
near. Edward appears behind her. She doesn’t turn around. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You’re impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin
is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak
like… you’re from a different time.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How long have you been seventeen?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … A while.</p>
<p><strong>them faster</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I know what the Cold Ones are. What you
are.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Say it. Out loud. Say it.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … Vampire</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You won’t hurt me. You’re different.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You think you know me?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You
need to see what</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: really am. What I look like in the harsh light of
the sun.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No! The sunlight will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Myth. You need to see the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Then come with me. Someplace where no one
can protect you. Where</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: could do what I’ve wanted to do from the first
moment I met you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Are you afraid! ?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This is what I am.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You’re… beautiful.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Because you believe the lie. The camouflage.
I’m the world’s most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you
in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: need any of that.. .</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: As if you could outrun me. As if you could
fight me off.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m designed to kill.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ve killed people.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I wanted to kill you. I’ve never wanted a
human’s blood so much in my life. I’m dangerous to you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I trust you, Edward. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You… took me by surprise. I don’t know how
to… do this.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Me, and my family, we’re different from
others of our kind. We’re not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only
hunt animals. We’ve learned to control our thirst.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Oh… I thought you hated me when we met.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I did. For making me want you so badly. I’m
still not sure I can control myself.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I know you can.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I wish I could understand this thing you see
in me. You look at me with those eyes.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Not of that. I’m afraid… you’ll disappear.
That I’ll lose you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Be very still.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And so the lion fell for the lamb.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Stupid lamb.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sick masochistic lion.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: About three things I was absolutely positive.
One, Edward was a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Two, there was a part of him that thirsted
for my blood. And three.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … I was falling, unconditionally and
irrevocably, in love with him.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How long have you been like this?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Since nineteen-eighteen. That’s when
Carlisle found me.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Where’d he find you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza.
My parents had already died.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The word excruciating comes to mind. But
what Carlisle did was much harder… not many of us have the restraint to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Didn’t he just… bite?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once
we taste blood, a sort of.. . frenzy begins. It’s almost impossible to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: But Carlisle did.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He
found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Does someone have to be dying to become like
you?.. .</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … No, that’s just Carlisle. He would never
do… this, to someone who had another choice.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So Carlisle’s the reason why you hunt
animals, instead of people.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not the only reason.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t want to be a monster.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way…
For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you
strong but isn’t very satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Show off.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s not that impressive, really. Anyone in
my family can do this.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Can they all read minds, too?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No, that’s unique to me. But Alice can see
the future.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Her visions are very subjective. The future
can change.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Come to my house tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Your house? With your family?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: But… what if they don’t like me?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m glad I amuse you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: A complication.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll pick you up tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Come to visit your truck?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Looks good. You got that dent out.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Actually, we came to visit your flat screen.
First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to
see you again.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Great, Dad. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Pale Ale.</p>
<p>****: Harry Clearwater’s homemade fish fry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Any luck with the Waylon case?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: A person did that?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: A crazy person, walking around barefoot this
time of year.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Spread the word out at the rez, will ya?
Keep the kids out of the woods.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Will do. Don’t want no one else getting
hurt.</p>

eyes pop open… and relief sweeps over her as she realizes it was just a
dream. But it haunts her.. .</p>
<p><strong>ext. cullen house - day 81</strong>: A timeless graceful
house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella climbs out, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s… wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You expected turrets, dungeons and
moats?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No… not moats. He takes her hand. She girds
herself. They head inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. cullen house - living room - day 82</strong>: Edward
guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass look out on
the river. Everything’s open and white. Historical objects are
tastefully placed throughout.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s so light and open.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thanks to tinted windows… It’s the one place
we never have to hide.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I told them not to do this.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Bon giorno?</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: Molto bene!</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: I hope you’re hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Oh, absolutely -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She already ate.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I just assumed – because you don’t eat, you
know.. .</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: Of course. That was very considerate of
you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ignore her. I do.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Yes, let’s keep pretending this isn’t
dangerous for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I would never, ever tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: She knows that.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: The problem is, you two have gone public
now, so.. .</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: No, she should know.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … Badly?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hi, Bella!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Alice.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And you’re Jasper, right?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You won’t hurt her, Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll give you a tour of the house.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Graduation caps?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: A private joke. We matriculate a lot.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What a nightmare, repeating high school.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: True, but the younger we start out in a new
place, the longer we can stay there.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: … and this is my room.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So you’re obsessed with music. But.. . No
bed?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Ever?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do you have any favorites?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties,
seventies.. .</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties.
Eighteen-nineties. Classical.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’d have to say… Debussy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My favorite, too.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to
play.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No dancing.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ever?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No tripping, no falling, no derision.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I can always make you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You don’t scare me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You really shouldn’t have said that.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Don’t you dare -</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: She’s brought him to life.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: He’s been alone too long… but how can it
end well?</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: Alice has been wrong before.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Not often.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Trust me?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: In theory.</p>

<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m healthy as a horse.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The suspect’s moving east. Kitsap County
Sheriff is taking over from here. They’re putting extra guys on.</p>

<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just… you should be around people. I leave
you alone too much.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Berry cobbler, two forks.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So spring training’s going well?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Phil’s working hard. We’re looking around for
a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent. You’d like Jacksonville,

<p><strong>edward</strong>: There’s something I’d like to try.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Oh… I’m… oh.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m stronger than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Wish I could say the same. I’m so
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t be. But we have to be careful. I can
never lose control with you. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I have a date with Edward Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s too old for you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: We’re both juniors. I thought you liked the
Cullens.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And I thought you weren’t interested in any
of the boys in town.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward doesn’t live �in town.� And it’s in
the early stage and - - whatever, he’s outside right now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now? He’s out there?</p>

<p><strong>edward</strong>: Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce
myself. I’m Edward.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I won’t keep Bella out late tonight. We’re
just going to go play baseball with my family.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bella’s going to play baseball?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes, sir, that’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well. More power to you, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She’ll be safe with me, sir, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You got that pepper spray?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No fair, reading Charlie’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And since when do vampires like baseball?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s the American pastime. Plus, there’s a
thunderstorm coming. It’s the only time we can play. You’ll see why.</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: Good thing you’re here. We need a umpire.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: She thinks we cheat.</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: I know you cheat. Call �em as you see �em,
Bella.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Now I get why you need the thunder.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That has to be a home run.</p>
<p><strong>esme</strong>: Edward’s very fast.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yer out?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Stop! I didn’t see them.. .</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They’re traveling so quickly -</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: You said they left the county - -</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They did, but then they heard us.. . And
changed their minds.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Put your hair down -</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Like that’ll help. I could smell her from
across the field.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I shouldn’t have brought you here. I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: I believe this belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Could you use three more players?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: I’m Laurent. This is Victoria. And
James.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Would you like to bat first?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: I’m afraid your hunting activities have
caused something of a mess for us.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Our apologies. We didn’t realize the
territory had been claimed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Yes, we maintain a permanent
residence.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Really? Well, we won’t be a problem any
more.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: The humans were tracking us, but we led
them East-</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You brought a snack.</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: in a flash, the Cullens rush into
position behind Edward – Laurent and Victoria line up behind James.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: The girl is with us.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: We won’t harm her.</p>
<p><strong>emmett</strong>: Just try it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: I think it best if you leave.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Yes, I can see the game is over. We’ll go
now. James?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Get Bella out of here. We’ll follow
them.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt
is his obsession, and my reaction set him off - -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: – We’re a large clan of strong fighters all
protecting one vulnerable human.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The first place he’ll go is your house.
He’ll track your scent there.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I said, leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bella, don’t do this. Just think about it,
please -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Get out! It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bella? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I have to get out of this place. Out of
Forks. I’m leaving. Now.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I can’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bells. Did he hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then what? Did he break up with you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I broke up with him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I thought you liked him?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s why I have to leave. I don’t want
this. I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll be in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your mother’s not even in Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: She’ll come home. I’ll call her from the
road.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can’t drive home now. I’ll take you to
the airport in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I want to drive. I need time to think. I’ll
pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bella… I just got you back.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He’ll forgive you. Slide over.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: His face… I said the same words my mother
used when she left him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was the only way he’d let you go.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Your father’s safe now, Bella. The tracker
is following us -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s alright. It’s just Emmett. Alice is in
the car behind us.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: He came to warn us. About James.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: I’ve grown tired of his games. But he’s got
unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I’ve never seen anything like
him in three hundred years … And the woman, Victoria, will back him.
Don’t underestimate her.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: I’m truly sorry for what’s been unleashed
here.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: I’ve had to fight our kind before. We’re
hard to kill.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But not impossible. We’ll tear him up</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: I don’t relish killing another creature.
Even a sadistic one like James.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: If he doesn’t get to one of us first.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Too late.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll run Bella south, while you lead the
tracker away -</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: No, Edward – the tracker thinks you
won’t leave Bella. He’ll follow you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll go with Bella. Jasper and</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: will drive her south.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker
will pick up Bella’s scent.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: If any of you get hurt because of me -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We won’t, there are five of us, two of them.
When it’s done, I’ll come get you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re my life now.</p>
<p><strong>on bella’s face</strong>: her eyes pop open. She’s lying atop
a bed, fully clothed. She rises, reorienting.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I wish he’d call.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You should eat.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: They could get hurt. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Edward’s changed since he found you. And
none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he
loses you.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The tracker. He just changed course.. .</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Where will it take him, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Mirrors. It’s a room of mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: How do the visions work? Edward said they
weren’t always certain.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: She sees the course people are on, while
they’re on it. If they change their minds, the visions change.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: So the course James is on now will lead him
to… a ballet studio?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’ve been here?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No. I don’t know. I used to take ballet
lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Was your school here in Phoenix?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I
haven’t been there in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Do you have any reason to go now?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No. Hell, no. I hated the place.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m coming to get you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bella, we’re in too deep. We can’t change
how we feel.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No… we can’t. When will you get here?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: In a couple hours. Then you and</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep
hunting.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Mom, I’m so glad you got my - -</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Bella? Bella? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay?
I’ll explain every -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: … Mom? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Nice house you have here. Not the best on the
block, but comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom
came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all
worked out quite well.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I must say, Forks High School doesn’t protect
its students’ privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to
find your previous address.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Bella? Bella?.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Leave my mother out of this.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re protective of her. That’s nice. You
can still save her. But you’ll need to get away from your friends. Can
you do that?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I… don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: If your mother’s life depends on it?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Where should I meet you?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The old ballet studio around the corner. And
I’ll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for
that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: 8th and Palo Verde, please.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Bella? Bella?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: ballet bar wraps around the walls - -</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Bella, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Don’t you want to dance, baby?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Everyone makes fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: But you’re a wonderful dancer.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Mom, I suck.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: That’s my favorite part. Stubborn child,
weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Sorry. But you really made it too easy.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: So to make things more entertaining, I’m
going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from
your house. Hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Excellent! An escape attempt.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’ll break Edward’s little heart.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: He will. His rage will make for more
interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my
stage well.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Still stubborn, aren’t you? Is that what
makes you special? Because frankly, I don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Too bad he didn’t have the strength to turn
you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It’s cruel,
really.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Well done! You’ve succeeded in annoying
me.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Tell Edward how much it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Tell him to avenge you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No! Edward, don’t.. .</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Cut! The end.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re alone… because you’re faster than the
others. But not stronger.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m strong enough to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Her femoral artery’s been severed. She’s
losing too much blood -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s on fire! My hand!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Venom - -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s going to happen. I’ve seen it -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Alice, find me a tourniquet.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: rag, a shirt.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: It’s burning!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s the other choice? You said -</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Tighter, above the knee -</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: You can try to suck the venom out.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I – won’t be able to stop -</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Find the will to stop. But choose, she
only has minutes left.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s alright, Bella. I’ll make it go
away.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cullen</strong>: Stop. Her blood is clean, you’re killing
her.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Death is peaceful. Easy.</p>
<p><strong>134 bella’s face appears in the whiteness</strong>: Eyes
closed. But they slowly open. She squints at the light.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Life… is harder.. . An oxygen tube rests
under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her
surroundings come into focus.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital room - day</strong>: Bella lies in a hospital
bed. Bandaged, leg in a cast. In bad</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward? Where’s -</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: He’s asleep. She nods across the room to a
chair in which Edward �sleeps. �</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: He never leaves. And your dad’s down in the
cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What… happened?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and
through a window.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Edward came here to convince you to come back
to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their hotel but you
tripped on the stairs. A moment… then Bella realizes it’s a cover story.
She nods.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Sounds like me.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: It’s Phil. He’s worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Mom, you’re… texting.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s great mom.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Jacksonville is always sunny and you’ll have
your own bathroom.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have
Dad.. .</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: And he’s there.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Charlie doesn’t like him. Blames him for your
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad?</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: want to talk to him. Apologize.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I’m sure he doesn’t care about that, Baby. But
I�ll go get him.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Is James - did you – ?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We took care of him. And the woman,
Victoria, she ran off.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m alive because of you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re in here because of me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The worst of it… was thinking</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: couldn’t stop -</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: But you did.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where
I can’t hurt you anymore.. .</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What? No! I want to be with you!</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: don’t want -</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Heard that before.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I put new pepper spray in your bag.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … and… you look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You really are trying to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Prom is an important rite of passage. I
don’t want you to miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>bella’s pov – the dj booth</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: You’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: See? You’re dancing.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: At prom.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Edward… why did you save me? If you’d let the
venom spread, I could’ve been like you by now.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I want you. Always.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I won’t end your life for you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer,
older</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s how it’s supposed to happen.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Not the way Alice saw it. I heard her. She
saw me like you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Her visions change, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Based on what someone decides. And I’ve
decided.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Is that what you dream about? Becoming a
monster?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I dream about being with you forever.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You really want this?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re ready right now?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re going to have a long and happy life
with me. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No one will surrender tonight. But I won’t
give in. I know what I want.</p>
