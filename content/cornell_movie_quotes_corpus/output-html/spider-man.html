<p><strong>second rev.</strong>: 7/29/1993</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa… what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: We begin again… let’s kick in that new
transducer. See if we can double the power output.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Whoa, Doc… wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey… dokey!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hiya Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hiya Liz… how’re you doing…?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How’m I doing what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Peter! Peter! Wait up!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Would you, uh… excuse us for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is it? what…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept
your paper?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah… well… all I got’s the data but they’ve
agreed to publish it when it’s finished. You know… it’s my calculation
on the Planetary Conjunction.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And its influence on the anti-force. Isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, you and the rest of the class. Every
one is busy with Liz.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Hiya, cupcakes…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Flash…!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And Flash is the busiest of them all…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, Harry… we’ll be late for
Octavius.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ock is nuts, don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But, a
genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Doctor Octavius! You are late for your lecture.
The students are waiting. Doctor Octavius!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Your friend is impossible Professor
Rosomorf, I told the board we should let him go.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What’s he doing in there, not his crazy
experiment again.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: You mean his anti-force theory… one day they’ll
give him the Nobel Prize for it.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Meanwhile he is demolishing our university.
Octavius!! Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The anti-force experiment has now reached the
limit of electronic overload safety. Therefore, Weiner, you will
disconnect the overload safety device…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Whoa, Doc… someone’s at the door…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: World class scientific mind and they stick me
in the basement with this third rate cyclotron…</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The DIAL marked “RELATIVE GRAVITY” reads
“1,000,000” but suddenly it snaps to “0.999999!”</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey! Dokey!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What is it, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Yes, gentleman can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Tell your boss, that his class is
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: You better tell him yourself.</p>
<p><strong>roz &amp; thorkel</strong>: Professor Octavius!!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Gentlemen, come, you must see this.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: But, your students…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The imbeciles can wait… I have better things to
do than teach introductory Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are kindless
adolescence.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: You see he is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our
university has ever had. Don’t go Thorkel!! Come! Look!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: The university pays you to teach something
to your students.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well, do you mean nothing… or do you mean
something but you won’t tell me what it is?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I mean plain nothing.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well, I guess that’s about as nothing as you
can get… plain nothing. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Liz…!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Ahh, it is something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No… look.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I am going for 20 percent power!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: NO!! Don’t do that…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Ock! Its dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Ock I warn you…</p>
<p><strong>libs</strong>: “Fire!” “Everybody out!”</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the
front door. Everybody out the front.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Liz! Come on…!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I can’t. Help me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Get back, you idiots. You can’t go in
there!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Help! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks for your help Flash.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: No problem wimp.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Our hero has a real way with words.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, why don’t you grow up.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: This man will bring a disaster upon this
university.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The universe is made up of forces… and
counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: But I… Professor Otto Octavius… have devoted my
life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I don’t believe it, I simply don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I don’t believe… oh, all right carry on
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Well! This week my dear students I have made a
stunning breakthrough…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute… you’ve got
fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I have no time for forms, or administrators who
persist in interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I now believe its possible that these counter
forces can be… collected… the way the magnifying glass collects the
sunlight… and focused into a hard beam I call… Weiner!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I call it, the Anti-Force!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: This anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of
undoing any natural force at which it is aimed… for instance…
Gravity!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: We patch in the cyclotron… The lights flicker
and go dim.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Pay no attention to the lights… I of course
steal its energy, and it looses power. We patch in the cyclotron… and we
gradually apply power. The power that I am stealing…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: And so we stand, four square against the
fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe… gravity… which
is holding down this goddamn ball. Rise!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What a crock…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shut up Harry… this is very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Mr. Parker! Have you some… interesting
observation you’d like to share with the class?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No sir…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Then shut up! And pay some attention to the
experiment.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Rise! Rise!!!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Now that’s what I call an experiment!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You are looking at a representation of two
universes. Our Blue one. Our real universe… something we can touch and
feel and see and draw calculations about. This is us. The Yellow
universe… this is something else. Some other dimension… something… on
the other side!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: If it were possible to generate enough power
behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity… but all our
universal forces at the same time. In effect… it would blast a hole
between this universe and the next. Each… would flow into each other. No
blue universe. No yellow. End, finished, over.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That sounds like a scenario for the end of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: My girl, it is! It is. It would mean wiping out
everything that’s known… and letting in everything that’s unknown.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Isn’t that a little dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Don’t worry yourself, true inter- dimensional
penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day… Maybe very near…
maybe in the 21st century…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Look, it’s just… I don’t know… when you and
Flash go after each other like that…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s not my type.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: He doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: And besides, he’s not all bad.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t get nicknamed Flash because you’re
a rocket scientist, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Give it up, Parker. You’d die for a nickname
like Flash.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, of embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Hey, Flash… I’m scalping a pair of the Midnight
Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: The Slammies??? I’d kill for that!!!</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Would you pay $125?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Well, uh, I… gee… if… can I tell you
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new
roommate… Kim Nickson.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Hellooo, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We’re going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You
coming?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t… I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle.
I’m trying to sell some photos.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Soooh, a photographer…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just an amateur. Well… nice meeting you,
Kim.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Yeah… I bet it would be.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can I be your date for the reunion
ShooShoo?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: No Jerk!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What did I say…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s not what you said, it’s how you say it,
ShooShoo!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: About my data I bet.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He knows about my work on the Planetary
Conjunction, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, Professor Octavius. I really admired
your experiment.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: We have a lot of interests in common, Peter.
Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That would be… great.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This
Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the
Sun… all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for
its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional.
Isn’t that the subject of your paper…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes sir, I’ve worked out a new way to
calculate the combined gravitational effect.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I’m a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could
find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all… checks out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well… I’m sort of working with Professor
Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that
my theory is… well, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The scoundrel… I want to see that data,
Peter!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But Professor Octavius… if I knew you were
interested… sorry, I’ve already given it to… Professor Rosomorf, and he
is after all the head of our Physics Department… and I couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Well, I’m certain something can be worked out.
Run along, young man.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Just a minute… how about if I show you my
discoveries… something I never showed to any other student… as a matter
of fact to anybody at all.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well I am really flattered, I mean I’d love
to… but I…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Very well shall we say if you come here
tonight…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But Professor I don’t now if I should…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Make it eight sharp… I’ll be waiting for you…
Right here…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The same academic world that’s so keen to
embrace that boy’s undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as
quackery. I ask you, Weiner… what is our society coming to? Ha!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: They are all a bunch of brainless assholes,
that’s what I say…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Weiner! Go get me that boy’s data!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Cost you fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Just get it. We’ll negotiate your fee when you
have the data, alright Weiner?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Little kids… I hate little kids. This is a
daily newspaper. We need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy
shit!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Kid? You want a pro’s assessment?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Your photos suck. Parker, my readers are
morons. I gotta grab them by the eyes. Every time you press the button
of that Nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents. So the next time
you’re about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am I taking dog bites
man? Because if you are…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know, I know. You want man bites dog…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Parker, this is the post modern 20th
century. I want man eats dog! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Rent! Rent, more bills, rent… electricity,
bills…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s nothing in there worth stealing!</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: That’s the understatement of the year.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aunt May, you’re trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: I was just so desperately bored… I thought I’d
come over and make you dinner…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I am old enough to… to make my own–</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: But I didn’t feel like getting to know your
roaches.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll introduce you.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I take pictures, remember?</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Anyway, I’ve decided to kidnap you for dinner
in Forest Hills…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s Friday night…</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Yes. Do you have a date?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Then come on.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Someone tried to rob me of some paper… I
suspect they were looking for that one.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Award winning stuff. Peter Parker’s data on the
Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another
title.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: My God, what’s going on in our school?
First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab… Now this. You
report it in triplicate, of course.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius.
Remember… the man is a very fragile genius. One day he’ll bring us all
the Noble Prize.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous
crackpot!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: That’s him again. He’s working day and
night.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I tell you the man is very dangerous. Come
on Rosomorf, let’s stop him before this building will explode.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Shut it down, Octavius.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: You’ve blown half the circuits in the
Science Center.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Call an electrician.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I have called the locksmith.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: What… what is he doing.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: We have to shut your lab down and take a
look at the lines.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Please, Otto, we must lock it up.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You’re denying me access to my cyclotron?!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey… just give me till tomorrow. I want
to clean up my papers. Tomorrow… Ha… Tomorrow you can have this
room…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Oh… well Thorkel… few more hours won’t make a
difference.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I hope.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Another brewski?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I’m fine, Uncle Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yah! Way to do it. Alright! You don’t follow
the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, not so much anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away…
I had this idea… I wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever
was. Geez, what ever happened to that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Little league.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah… Babe Ruth you wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: It’s on the table! Turn off the TV!</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: How’s that girl you told us about,
Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Liz? She’s great… But she has a
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: A boy your age should have a
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aunt May… she has a steady boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Peter, any girl that’s worth your
attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend… But if she really gets to
know what you have to offer she’ll… you get my drift?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, just leave him alone, okay. When he’s
ready for girls he’ll be a holy terror. It’s in the blood. Lookit, how
are you fixed for money, Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I’m alright. My scholarship covers almost
everything, and I sell some photos here and there. Today my physics
professor asked for some of my work… he wants to study my data. They
might publish my work in the science magazine… that’ll bring me some
money…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Publish your work?! You hear that May…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little early
tonight, to meet Professor Octavius… He offered me to be his
assistant…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Whoa! Did you hear that May…?</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Oh, Peter, you promised you’d spend the
night…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I… I can’t, Aunt May. Professor Octavius
wants to discuss my new findings.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Peter, what you should be finding… is a
nice girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I’ll show them… closing the cyclotron on me…
Weiner!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Yes, Professor…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Where is he? It’s ten past eight o’clock…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: That must be him. He opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You are late. Weiner, go outside and get us
something to eat. And don’t steal it! Just buy it. I’ll reimburse
you.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Do you want anything Parker?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No thank you, I just had dinner at my
aunt’s…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Piss off, Weiner!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey, Parker… how would you like to take
Weiner’s place… I mean, be my assistant?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, Professor, that would be a great honor,
but I’m already working with…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Rosomorf… that imbecile. Don’t you understand,
kid, that I am about to uncover the greatest discovery since Einstein
came up with his theory of relativity… The “Anti-Force.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You should
go for the Noble Prize Professor…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much bigger
prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me show you, kid, what I got here.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Present maximum anti-force power to date is 38
percent of theoretical limit. I have patched in the variable
particle-wave accelerator… I will now try to reach 50% power… And if
your paper has any value… I can use it to get the power I’m missing to
create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power
in our or any other universe, capish!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry, Professor, I can’t do it. I gave my
word to Professor Rosomorf.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: 50 percent… anti-force… 50 percent… that’s all
I’m missing! Parker, we can be rich together!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry… I’d better go now.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You’ll be sorry, Parker.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You! Get out of there, you creeping…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Noooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: It’s an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Professor… what happened to you? What did
you do…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Oh my God… what happened here…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: There is no danger. Please go back to your
dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Spill it out, Professor! The public wants
to know!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now
what really happened here?</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: There will be a press announcement in the
morning Mr. Jameson… now if you’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I have nothing to say… there will be an
announcement. Now, please go home… everybody… we must clear the
grounds…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: You think they’ll cancel classes?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They must… the whole building must be
contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How about nuclear contaminations?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: My God… lets beat it. But nobody moves.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Could anyone be in there, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know… Maybe Professor Octavius. He
usually works late…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: That nut, I bet it was all his doing…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Hey Parker! Peter Parker!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here? What’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: That’s for them to know, and for you to
find out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But sir, they wouldn’t tell us. You heard
Thorkel… he said…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: A press announcement tomorrow…! But we must
know tonight Parker. This is your university, right…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: You got your camera?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure, but I can’t–</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: A hundred dollars says you can?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Get inside and get pictures, fifty
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You just said a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Seventy, but I want blood and gore.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Seeya guys.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Where is he going?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: To make fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Take it easy. Take it easy with him.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Take him away and never bring him back!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What hit me?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: What hit you?</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: I don’t know. It was so fast.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: You’re going to be fine, Otto.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ow!!!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey! What are you doing here, kid?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I feel a little funny…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeah? Well, I ain’t laughing. Get out… Just
get out of here…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You get yourself over to the Police
lines.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right. Police lines.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I… got pictures of the Professor… in there…
it’s so strange in there… so bizarre…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.
Pick this up in the morning. There’ll be two crisp twenties tucked
inside.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is weird. My God, I feel so weird…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Very weird.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Very, very weird.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, what the hell!!</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: You’re a kid who’s going places, and I’m

girls, blue movies…</p>

<p><strong>peter</strong>: Max Reiss, Talent management.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: It’s a big outfit. Got a lot of
departments.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah… well… why you approach me? I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Oh yes you are… very talented. The three
questions of show business success. One do you think you possess a
unique talent?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Two… what are you gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Three… how much money you got in your
pocket?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: You invest half of that with me and I’ll make
you a star.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: I’m talking about fame. I’m talking about
fortune. I’m talking about the chance of a lifetime. How’d you like to
be on MTV tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: MTV…? Me? Really?</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same

<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Peter? What time is it? Are you
alright?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, no, I mean yeah I’m fine, but listen…
Aunti, the craziest thing happened to me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Does this have to do with a certain girl
we talked about at dinner?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, no, look, there was this radioactive
experiment… I was poisoned!</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: You were what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was bitten by a bug.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No… No… A spider…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Peter, did you at least talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on the
hand… by a poisonous spider.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: She bit you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. I was in the bathroom and…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,
this is craziness, why don’t you use your bed? You’re up all night.
You’re in the radioactive labs. You never take time to eat or sleep. Am
I right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, Aunt May.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Did you eat something today?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, Aunt May.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember
we love you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And I love you too, Aunt May. And by the way,
I got a mess of super powers today.</p>

mental activity is ten times of any normal man…!</p>
<p><strong>brainman</strong>: Equipment malfunction…?</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: Hell, yeah… his. My God… I thought
I’d seen everything…</p>
<p><strong>surgeon #2</strong>: But this is beyond medicine. This is
madness…!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It is so freaky…</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: Okay, lets stop yakking and get
cracking. I want to go in at the upper thoracic. Then we’ll work our way
around. Hang in there, man.</p>

Arthroscope stand by. Read out parameters in progress. Let’s go in. You
alright?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes… Yes, of course. Everything’s online.</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: Scalpel! No… no… a larger one… the

<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You have a visitor, Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Octavius, I’m afraid I have bad news for
you.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The cyclotron is damaged…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What used to be the cyclotron was
permanently shut down this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: But my work!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Your work is a disaster! Look at
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Myself? I don’t matter. Nobody matters anymore.
To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Destroy life. Life is… insignificant. Bags of
sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say?</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Oh, my God, what are those horrible things
sticking from your body?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Thorkel, if I told you that for one moment in
time I broke all the laws! For one brief glorious moment, I broke
through to the other side. I saw… I felt… I became creation.</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: What on Earth are you rambling about?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so clearly
now. Universal destruction, yes. All I need is the power… then I can
destroy this illusion you call life. It is my destiny to lead us to the
light!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: You’re a madman.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: And you are a fool. I will end the universe as
you know it. And in that final moment… I’ll laugh my ass off while
you’re kissing yours goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Goodbye is right, Octavius… You’re fired…
sacked… canned. You are history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn’t be more
pleased to be the first to tell you this good news…</p>
<p><strong>thorkel</strong>: Let me down Ock… you crazy… MONSTER! Let me
down!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: MTV Wrestling?!</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: That’s the place. Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, Mr. Reiss… I’m not real interested in
watching a wrestling match.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Who said anything about watching a wrestling
match? You’re here to win a wrestling match!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me? You must be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: You hop around. You know, the way you did
last night. Your opponent gets tired. He falls down. The ref counts to
three, you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: You’re really gonna love this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, really, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: You don’t have to know. I know enough for
both of us. Change in there.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: A costume… something that fits your talent.
Go put it on. I’m sure you’ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How does it look? I feel like it’s
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Cover your face with the mask.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know who
you are…</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: And now, a new challenger, for the
thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one hundred and fifty pounds… from
parts unknown! Here is the Amazing… Mysterious… Incredible Superman…</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: No, not Superman… Spider-Man…</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: …Spider-Man!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Kill the sucker, Crusher!</p>
<p><strong>hipster</strong>: Whatsamatter, Crusher, can’t you crush that
bug?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Okay, Web Face, this is it!</p>
<p><strong>hipster</strong>: Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He is

<p><strong>reiss</strong>: We are going to get a thousand–</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Hi, who are you, kid?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m Peter Parker.</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: He is Spider-Man, and I handle him… Whenever
you want a rematch call me. Next time it’s gonna be ten thousand, what
do you say… Crusher?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I’m really sorry
about what happened in there. Really…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Oh, well, I don’t know what happened to me
tonight… I really don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>reiss</strong>: I know… you lost. Big man you lost to the
Amazing Spider-Man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yeah… he’s some clown we saw on TV last night…
boy does Flash think he’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He does…</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: I love wrestling.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really believe
this little guy in a stupid Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hey, we better rush… visiting hours will be
over soon.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Doctor Octavius? You have visitors. Doctor
Octavius?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ock is not here!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: My God, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’d better call the doctor!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’d better call the police!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: What a wreck. What a useless, wasted wreck.
Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter!
A world class, super cyclotron!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: There you are, doc… where have you been…
whoa this place is messed up.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Where have you been, you imbecile?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I went to the wrestling…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Wrestling…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I went after the kid. You still want that
Parker guy’s data, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Well, did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: No, I followed him… but I lost him in the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Lost him? You–</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I’ll find him, Maestro… I promise… soon…
maybe by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: So how was the wrestling?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Fantastic! There was this new wrestler… beat
the mighty Crusher. You won’t believe it… a nothing of a guy… calls
himself this stupid name… the Amazing Spider-Man… would you believe
it?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I’ll just go and
wrestle myself one of these days… with all my new arms… I’m sure I can
beat Crusher or any other monster.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I beat him
or not?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: No… no, please… I mean yes, yes… you’ll beat
him easily… let me down… Please… I’ll do anything for you…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: The Parker data… get me the Parker data, you
hear?!!!</p>

sincere.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I’m looking for Peter Parker.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Oh, yes… so why not use the front
door?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Hey, I know you…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I saw you crushing the Crusher.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: You like wrestling?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I love it! You are the best wrestler I have
ever seen… please don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Oh, please… don’t kill me. Please help me
down.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Of course I’ll help you down. I am
Spider-Man… the good guy, am I not?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Yes… yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: And by the way, Peter Parker does not
live here anymore…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: And tell the Professor he can’t have
Peter’s data. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a
cyclotron? Okay… lets see here. Page three. We got 30,000 feet of
50-gauge copper co-ax… twin 550 XK transformers… cadmium accelerator
rails, a half dozen… a GBC relative multi-phase transducer… and one
yellow thermos. That’ll be $475,989.65…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Wrap it up…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What about the money… or do you pay by credit
card?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Cash! I’ll be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>bank guard</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Cash!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Doesn’t he look amazing in that one? Look,
he’s flying in the air!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: I don’t care if he flies to the moon. He’s
just another wrestler in a silly costume. Look at this, Parker, right
off the wire. This is the guy who hit that armored truck this morning.
They say he has metal arms… get me a picture of this character!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Metal arms?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Four of them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ock…?!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: The web faced weirdo… He is a joke in a
Halloween costume… don’t make me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Now get out of here and don’t come back
without something I can use!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes sir…</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: A mega baloney… A bug in blue tights… what
next?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The Journal said he was a mega-smash on</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I’m going to the Masquerade. It’s Halloween
tonight Doc, aren’t you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go
without an outfit.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You’re not going to any ball, clown. You’re
going to get me Peter Parker’s data…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: I was almost killed on my last try… Look at
all these bruises…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I don’t care if you come back dead. Just get
it!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: All right… boss please let go…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Just get it, Weiner. I’m running out of time.
If you fail me again, you won’t have to concern yourself with money
anymore… DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You should have worn a costume. I told you to
wear a costume.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s… embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There’s Liz…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: … howdy partners.</p>
<p><strong>peter/harry</strong>: Hiya, Professor Rosomorf.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Any word on Doctor Octavius?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Nothing beyond what I read in the papers. I’m
afraid he’s not the same man we knew. You know, I’ve been digging
through the notes on his experiments…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: You boys must have had an extraordinary
classroom experience.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes sir… oh… I’m going to be a little late
with my paper on the Planetary Conjunction, sir…</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Whenever you’re ready… I’ll look at it. I know
it’s going to be an important work… and Peter, take my hat.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: It is a costume party.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, there’s Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not the real one, I’m sure…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can never be sure… all kinds of crazy
stuff can happen at a masquerade ball…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I bet I know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hiya, Liz…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man
costume?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s a very clever outfit you’ve got there,
Flash.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Take a hike, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How did you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: His pretty blue eyes give him away…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anyway, who’ll be sitting with you at the
Halloween Ball?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I wanna dance… Hey, Spider-Man… Shall we Flash
dance?</p>
<p><strong>flash/spider-man</strong>: Hey, I’m reading the paper,

<p><strong>flash</strong>: Wow… I’ll give you anything if you introduce
us.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you grant me this dance…?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Hey, Flash-Man… Wanna dance…?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Well, why not.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Thank you, thank you. We have a special
surprise guest tonight. The Empire State University Masquerade Ball
presents… The “Slammy” winning star of MTV’S wrestling tournament… The
Amazing Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Go ahead… go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Come on… Flash…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Who are you…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: One day you’ll know…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You sound very familiar.</p>
<p><strong>peter/spider-man</strong>: Sure I do… I’m your friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and roll’s
screwed up the whole TV.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hey! Can’t you go any faster?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What’m I in, a race?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I don’t know… I get this tingling in my
brain, like some danger is lurking just ahead. I’m worried about Aunt
May and Uncle Ben…</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Your family?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Well, they are kind of my parents. They
raised me. I lost both of my parents in a car accident… please step on

<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Step on it… so now you want to kill yourself
in another accident… not with me, Boychick.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: But I’m telling you… I’ve got this–</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: … tingling… I know. And I got ulcers…
Everybody’s got something to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Please… Faster… Please.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Okay, you asked for it.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What? It’s nothing… go back to sleep… Oh, I’ll
go look. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Some crazy kinda town, huh? You hear about
that hold-up? The guy with the six arms? Hey, I see it all on this job.
What kinda outfit is that, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Look, I’m really in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You said the magic words, we have a flat
Boychick.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mice…</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Some crazy kinda town…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Sporting goods…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: All I want it the kid’s computer crap!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let go before I blow your brain’s out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: You let go!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uncle Ben!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh my God… Uncle Ben…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Ben gets through everything. He’ll be
alright. The doctors are…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Excuse me. You the nephew?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Your uncle’s a brave man. Apparently, the
perpetrator was after something of yours. Your uncle didn’t know what it
was but he stood up to him anyway. You ought to be proud of him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I am… how is he…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Ask the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: How’s my… how’s my husband doing…?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mrs. Parker, I’m sorry. We tried.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Crash cart! STAT!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Let the medics handle it. Look, if it
makes you feel any better. We’re gonna nail this guy. He crashed his
getaway car. We got him trapped in a warehouse on Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: She’s alright. She just fainted. We’ll have
to check her for symptoms of shock. If you want to wait, you can get
some coffee on the third floor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I… I think I wanna go out for some fresh
air.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: That place is loaded with solvents and
chemicals. If we blast our way in, it’s gonna go up like a roman
candle.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: We could go in through the fifth floor wash
room.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: What’s that up there? Throw a light on
that!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: He’s got a partner!</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: We got an accomplice up there! And we got a
clear shot. Do we have a go?</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: That’s a go.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Say your prayers, Weiner!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: You ain’t takin’ me… Spider-Man… who ever
you are…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hey, creep!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: This is your last chance, you two. Either
you’re coming out, or we’re coming in!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Stay back! Whoa… stay back down there!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Stand up, you.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You have thirty seconds to come out!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: You’re my ticket outa here. Gimme that
stupid mask!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Then I’ll take it myself.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Well, look what we’ve caught in our
web…</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Don’t hurt me, man. Please don’t hurt
me…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>weiner</strong>: Get me out of this madhouse!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable
differential… good enough.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey… now all I need is Parker’s data.
Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it… I can’t trust anybody. Only you, my
babies… only you can I trust… Okay… If I have to do everything myself…
I’m going to do it. I’ll be back… my babies… my new babies!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my computer
yet? I got a paper too, you know…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh my God… oh, it’s you, Liz… I didn’t expect
you… uh… give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi, Liz. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What were you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Cleaning up. Come on. I’ll get your computer.
Where’s Flash parked?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Flash didn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. Well… how are you going to get it
home?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Taxi… I guess.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You must spend a lot of time with this
Spider-Man guy… Peter! Don’t you think you ought to unplug that!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I, uh, I’ll go down to the corner… see it I
can hail that taxi.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter…?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Doctor Octavius…! You’re… You’re… You’re so
weird!… with those… what do you call those…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Waldos… Did you hear about Spider-Man? That’s
me… the real Spider-Man… now tell me, where is that jerky friend of
yours… Parker?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter?… oh… he’s not here. He’s gone. I don’t
think he’ll be back for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You wouldn’t lie to your Professor now, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing
like that? Really. He’s… out.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: We’ll wait. OCK grabs LIZ’S HAIR with his
WALDOS.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What are you doing… let me go! Please… take
those things out of my hair!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: My Waldos, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Whatever you call them… please…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: He’s a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe, but
nice, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe. He’s very
inexperienced.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You know, you’re a fascinating young lady…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You’re so refreshing. You’re so…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Shocking…?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t say shocking…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I would!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter…!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wait here…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Liz?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter! Help! Peter!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Peter Parker has something I want… And I’m
going to have something he wants.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Put her down, Ock.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I know what’s happening to you, Ock.
I’ve been through a lot of changes myself lately. You have to listen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Spider-Man.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Spider-Man…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: That’s a lot of crap, clown… I am Spider-Man,
not you. Ask you girlfriend. Tell him!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I’m a good friend of Peter Parker’s Ock.
Just like that girl you’re holding. Now let her go.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do
not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I’ll let
her go.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Put me down, you mechanical mutant!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You jerk!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Tell your friend Peter next time I’ll get the
taxi myself…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Hey… you jerk… you phony Spider-Man… Prepare to
meet your death, bug.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Actually, I’m rather fond of living…
especially now…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Octavius. Just stop and think.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I am thinking, insect. I’m thinking about
exterminating you!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Okay, if that’s the way you want it…
Let’s see what those chrome knuckles can do, Doc…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will
be able to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Stop you from what…?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: My destiny!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Over here, Octopus!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: That’s Professor Octopus to you Spider
Jerk!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Give it up, Professor. You’ll never
catch me!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: So long, sucker.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: It’s that Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I’m rescuing you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Thanks but nooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: He won’t get away this time!</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Hold your fire! He’s got a girl.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Looks like he’s got a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Wait a minute. Where are you taking me? SPIDEY
hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I better just take you back where you
belong.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hold on tight.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: If you’re trying to impress me Spidey, I want
you to know I’m not easy. Okay, I’m impressed… now put me down, Spidey…
put me down.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I like the way you say Spidey… Nobody
calls me Spidey… now we go…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Wow… look, this is our dormitory. I can get to
my room. Hey, wait a minute… there’s Flash, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Liz?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You know my name?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Liz, listen to me. There’s something I
have to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Okay, put me down and we can talk, alright?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: All I know is you’re the Amazing Spider-Man… or
better you’re Spidey the good guy on the block… you’re a weirdo in a
clown spider suit.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: And that’s all you know about me? Okay,
lets get your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: How many do you have? I meant Flash.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: He’s not? Then who is?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: There’s someone I like, but he’s too shy to
notice.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Flash!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Liz!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You know everybody… Flash we have to call
Peter!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Hey, they won’t let up, man! They keep
calling you an accomplice in that burglary murder. But that’s a crock,
ain’t it? I’m with you, Spidey, 100%</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: By the way, what are you doing with… Liz?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: She needed a lift.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Oh… okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of
beer!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Thanks, but I have some business to take
care of.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Well… take care of that later. Wait here.
I’ll get the beer.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How’d you know this was Flash’s place?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Peter Parker told me all about it.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter told you all about Flash?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: No… he told me all about you. See you
later.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Hey, where’d he go? Hey, Spider-Man!!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter told your Hero all about me…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: He would, wouldn’t he… that jerk!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Octavius!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Kim! Have you seen Harry?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah… have you seen him today?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: No, un unh.</p>

<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. What a night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, that was some ride home… must have been
pretty exciting.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It was… okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les
Miserables… wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry… I’m really busy… I mean, not tonight…

<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hey, Peter… how did you know about last
night…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What about last night?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: My exciting ride with Spider-Man…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh… Sorry… I gotta hurry… I have to find
Harry… I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.</p>

<p><strong>insert</strong>: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then
a GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN, JUPITER, the SUN
and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER rises.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Enormous. It’s enormous. The Parker
calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary
Conjunction. Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I knew it. I knew it! Universal destruction!
It’s doable! I am putting a countdown clock on the Planetary Conjunction
now!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey. Now let’s see if I have enough
power to drive this beast.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I gotta remember to have that fixed. There
you are, I’ve been looking for you all over town.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I went to the wrestling, wanted to see that
Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn’t show up.</p>

happened.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My Planetary Conjunction papers… they were
stolen…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh my God… Are you sure…? Who would do such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ock…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course… but why…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We have to find out, sit down. I want to
access Dr. Octavius’ main program. I want to know about his experiments
with the cyclotron. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can try. I could access the system in the
dorm. Okay. And through that I could crack the main line.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the
Octavius file…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, let’s try.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah
Jameson!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: I need pictures of your friend, the Amazing
Spider-Man. But I need bad guy shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots.
We’re gonna pin that insect to the wall. Whaddaya say?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: What about that kid? On the job

<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know, but whatever it is, it’s only
six hours away.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The Planetary Conjunction?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Could be…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Or Doc Ock’s end of the world experiment… Or
both!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re not telling me you
think the world is gonna end tonight…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You want to wait around till midnight to find
out?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, but…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let’s see what else we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It might be a calculation of the amount of
power he needs to create the hole between the force and the
anti-force.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s a lot of energy. What could generate
power like that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The closest you could come is the New York
City Subway System.</p>

Rosomorf!!</p>

back to my university. I must stop Ock… he’s gone crazy. Can you help
me?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Sure thing, just don’t take the train.
Come on… give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this
with the train, if he’s come this far, then I can pretty well predict
his next step. He’ll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be
stopped… or else he’ll destroy our world.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Let’s get you out of here first,
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Wait Spider-Man. I don’t think I can make it…
You mustn’t waste time saving me… you must save the world! You must go
and stop Ock!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Where can I find him…?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I’m
sure…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Think Rosomorf, think where one can find
Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270…?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: There’s only one place he can get the Plutonium
SL 270…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Where…?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Toxic… toxic dump… any toxic dump would have SL
270.</p>

Plutonium… must get that crazy old loony… before he gets to the
Plutonium… toxic dump… where are the toxic dumps…?</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: You’re as lovely as Peter said you
were.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Thank you. He really wanted so badly to come
see you. He called me up out of the blue.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Tell me about Peter. What’s he been up to?
He seems so preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, you know Peter… he’s all caught up in some
kind of study he’s doing. Things are really crazy at the university now.
Things are crazy… everywhere. I guess Peter’s just… well, you know…
pulled into his shell.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: When Peter was little, he loved to hide.
In the closets. Under the sink. He always needed a secret place. But
when I’d look for him, he’d always laugh… he wanted to be found.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yeah… well. I don’t think he wants me to find
him… Well, I’d better be going. My friend Flash is picking me up.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: This Flash… he isn’t your boyfriend, is
he?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No… not really… I think you can guess why…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Elizabeth…? She turns.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Finders keepers, losers weepers.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: That’s what I used to say to Peter when I
found him.</p>

dumps. Oh! Oh! Oh… yeah!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: What’s up, Ock?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You!!!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You’re a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I’ve no time
to waste on you now.</p>

spread ’em</p>

someone your own size?!</p>

Vette for me?</p>

in that shitty red car…</p>

<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: New Jersey has the largest toxic waste
dump in the world.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: What does he want with toxic waste?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: He’s looking for Plutonium, my dear… The
car has to slow down… it’s in a traffic jam.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Sorry… can’t do anything about this
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Try to stay with me. I don’t want to
lose him!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Open that now, and you’ll spoil
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Insect! I am going to squash you to death… Once
I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Goodbye, Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Noooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it.</p>

up.</p>

<p><strong>ock</strong>: So you’ve avoided the nuclear pool, have you,
Spider-Man?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Well, so far so good. But I can’t hold
on much longer.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Pity…!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let’s
talk this over face to face… throw me a line…</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okay… face to face… Catch this!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Don’t do it, Professor!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: I know you… and you, young lady. Both of you
are in my physic class, aren’t you…? Come… you can help me. I need to
get some of these drums to my laboratory… help me… and I’ll give you
special grades. What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Leave him alone!!!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Leave them alone Otto!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: But, they won’t help me. Everybody is trying to
destroy my experiment. And so are you, Rosomorf.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Otto… I was wrong. I’ve gone over your
research. It’s brilliant, Otto. It’s mad, but it’s brilliant. You have
much work left to do. I want to help you, Otto. For the sake of science,
go and do your experiment. Leave… these kids alone and I’ll help
you.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You will? You too?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Help me with these drums, I need to get them to
my laboratory immediately.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Do as he says.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl right
down the toilet!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Professor Rosomorf, it’s no good, double
dealing… why did you help him…?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Don’t lose your energy screaming. Catch this
rope and climb up, come on!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: I’ve been through the Octavius data. He has
enough power with his Plutonium. Especially if he gets his hands on
Parker’s data, there he has enough power to do what he wants to do. And
we are not going to stop him in time before the Planetary Conjunction
occurs tonight…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Stop the car. I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: ROZ’S foot stabs the BRAKE.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Do you have a dime?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Harry?!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Peter, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Listen, Harry. You must get my paper
before Ock uses it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your Planetary Conjunction data? It’s too
late… Ock’s got your paper, it’s in his computer already.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of
the SUN, EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But don’t worry… he can never use it without
Plutonium.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: He’s got the Plutonium, and he’s on his
way back to the lab! And he’s got two prisoners with him… Liz and
Flash!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry… he needs a huge amount of power…
thousands of volts of electricity… to get to the Anti-Force.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: He can get to the power. Electrical
power… to the max. Nuclear power… SL 270. And now, at the moment of full
Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun…
maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock’s final power
source.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Damn… the Conjunction is due at midnight!
What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey… have fun, young ones… for the last
time.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right,
all there is left to do is…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Wait… I think I can release my right hand…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How much time is left? Wait… I can find out…
my God… 59 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: The only way we can interfere with Ock’s
plan is to find a computer center… fast.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Our University has the biggest center in
town.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Yeah, but who’s gonna work ’em?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think I can get some help… I can teach
anyone how to work a code in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Then do it!</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Hey, this is easy.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Hey, Harry I need help.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: I got one! I got one!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Harry! Get over here!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A goddamn water leak…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Hey, look at this. Empire State University.
This is our cyclotron, right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: It says “no information on net.”</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Damn… we can’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: You mean… we can’t stop loony Ock…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean the world is in danger…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: We must find Peter, he knows these computers
better than all of us.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, but where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I bet he is with Spider-Man…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Look at the moon… I have never seen it so
big.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: What is that…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Must be the sun.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: It’s started. Step on it Professor, or
we’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Our campus… right there… see those beams from
Ock’s lab. We’re late… it’s coming… the Conjunction will happen in a few
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Stop the car…! Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Where…? What…?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Aha! You never included the Conjunction in your
calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you have
to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted
our lives to… all the patterns, all the harmonies… everything will be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my
destiny!!!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: It is cosmic suicide! You have no right!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: You have to stop him… Spider-Man you have to
stop him.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I’m afraid we’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: He’s in there. I know Peter is in there. She
breaks into a run.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Liz, don’t… Liz come back… come back! LIZ
runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY flashes across
the doorway, stopping them.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has started. My
Anti-Force is on! History is being made… Spider-Man, Rosomorf cheer up
friends… we’re on our way to the unknown cosmos… we three are about to
visit heaven… real Gods heaven.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It’s
happening!</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Surreal DIALS spin madly.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter! Peter, where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Liz! Liz come on out!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get back! Flash… get back!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Wow…!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Oh my God… Liz is inside there!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: What about Peter? Is he there with them?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, but I bet Spider-Man is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s some show… if ever I saw one.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Tear out the front page! Change the
headline… The biggest news is happening right now… we need photos… a
camera… get me a camera…!</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Where is it going Otto?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Other worlds, Roz, other times, other
dimensions, who knows? Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Then… why?</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The
new way!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Don’t listen to him Professor Roz.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: No, you don’t listen to that clown, he can’t
save you, or the world for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Once and for all, Spider-Man… once and for all
we’ll end the legend of your powers.</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You!! You were my teacher!!!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You were my teacher! And you want to destroy my
experiment. You are a scientist for heaven sake… don’t you want to know
what’s up there?</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Yes, but not on account of our world. We have
only one world… only one life. The floor begins to craze and then crack
like ice around a hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as
the section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and falls
through.</p>
<p><strong>roz</strong>: Spider-Man! Only you can save us now…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Roz!!! Murderer!!!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Forget that old fool, insect. My Spider-Man…
Come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter! Peter!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Let’s have it, old boy! A bizarre DUEL
takes place. The CENTER pitches this way and that. SPIDEY and OCK move
from foothold to foothold, from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Liz!! OCK seizes the opportunity to
whack SPIDEY across the head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building
now lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY ducks inside
too and pulls the GRATE.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Where’s Peter? He must be here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: He’s around, don’t worry… we’ll find
him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: This building is flying. I’m in a goddamn
flying building…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I think we have to pull some of these
cables. Try those over there. I’ll work on these. We gotta slow this
thing down somehow. We got helicopters coming.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Pull!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: The power!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Spider-Man. You’re end is coming. Life in its
present form is ending… new dimensions, new horizons…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I don’t know!!!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I can’t… hold on!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hold tight, Liz, hold tight!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: You cut my power… there’s too little power…
It’s so tiny… so tiny… there’s only space… for me. But I’ve done it,
Spider-Man. I have broken through… I’ve broken through!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Don’t do it, Dr. Octavius!</p>
<p><strong>ock</strong>: Okey… dokey… Now that’s what I call an
experiment!!!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I can’t control her. She’s dropping too
fast! Alright… let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: But what about Peter? We’ve got to find
Peter!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Peter will be okay, I promise you… Let’s
go before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Maybe there’s another way…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s breaking apart!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Alright, keep moving, a step at a
time!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We have to go back.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: We can’t go back.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Forget it…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Okay, have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What am I supposed to do with this!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Go ahead. It’s easier than it looks!
We’ve got to try the fire escape.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: The door is stuck.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Liz, Up here!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on. I’ve found a way down.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I knew you were going to say that.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Where’s the way out?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right there!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, help me with this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay, stand still.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Is this going to work?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How do I know?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I just adore confidence in a man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What is it you say when you jump?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your prayers.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man
for.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Somehow, I don’t think we’ve seen the last of
him.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Peter…! Finders, keepers…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What…? What is it? Why do you look like
that?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I think I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You are…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: With your friend…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Spider-Man? You’re in love with
Spider-Man?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I am… you think we’ll see him again?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We might… you never know. He kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh. This may be the end of a beautiful
friendship you know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, I’m going to warn you right up front.
If somebody told you this was a happy story, if somebody said I was just
your average, ordinary seventeen year old, not a care in the world…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: You do NOT talk to her! How many times I
gotta tell you that? Do you listen when I talk? Hey! I asked you a
question! Do you LISTEN when I’m talking to you?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huh? Sorry, I wasn’t listening.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Next time you’re gonna pay, puny Parker, you
are gonna pay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will a credit card be okay?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What kind of man-</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, I know you mean that in a good way…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Leave him alone, Flash.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks, M.J.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s what I was trying to say on the bus, I
live right next door to you. And I’m in your biology class.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: People, please, no wandering! If you are a
Midtown High School student on the field trip, I need you in the
building now!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This class. Our class. I’m Peter.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh yeah! Well, you better get away from me.
Flash has a real temper, and I might not be there to save your butt next
time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Sure you were, Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anything wrong, Dad? You hardly said a word
all the way from the house.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: You’ll have to get dinner yourself tonight,
I need to work.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They say if you talk about something that
worries you, you take away its power.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I was under the impression you asked me to
give you a lift, not deliver a speech on the way.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: John? Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Not at all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Osborn. Gotta be Osborn.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I don’t appreciate the amateur
psychoanalysis. Maybe you should stop seeing Dr. Hirsch, you’re starting
to think you’ve got his degree.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is it the company? If there’s a problem, you
could tell me about it. Is there?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Considering OsCorp’s market capitalization
just exceeded the gross national product of Spain, the answer to your
question is no, there’s nothing wrong at the company.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: How many private academies have you been
kicked out of? Has it sunk in for you that you’re now attending a public
school? Are you aware of the ramifications of that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I like it better.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: One day you will inherit OsCorp. One day you
will run my company. My grandfather’s company. Since you asked, Harry,
that’s what worries me. In fact, it terrifies me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: There are more than 32,000 species of
spider in the world.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: They are in the order Aranae, which is
divided into three sub-orders- Mesothelea, Orthognatha, and
Labidognatha. All spiders are carnivorous, ravenous eaters who feed on
massive quantities of protein, in liquid form, usually the juices of
their prey. Arachnids from each of the three groups possess varying
strengths which help them in their constant search for food.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I love spiders.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: I step on them.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: The crab spider- family Thomisidae,
genus Misumena- spins no web to catch its prey, but hunts instead, using
a set of reflexes with nerve conduction velocities so fast some
researchers believe it almost borders on precognition, an early
awareness of danger, a “spider sense.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For the school paper?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>popular kid</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Or my father will fire your father.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Over five painstaking years, Columbia’s
genetic research facility has fully mapped the genetic codes of each of
these spiders.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Armed with these DNA blueprints, we have
now begun what was once thought impossible- inter-species genetic
transmutation.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: This is the Recombination Lab, where we
use synthesized transfer-RNA to encode an entirely new genome, combining
genetic information from all three spiders into these ten
genetically-designed super-spiders, the first mankind has ever
produced.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Just imagine- if one day we can isolate
the strengths, powers and immunities in human beings and transfer that
DNA code among ourselves. All known disease could be wiped out. Of
course, we’re nowhere near ready to start experimenting with humans, nor
do we know that we ever should. So for the moment we’re concentrating on
these ten spiders. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I only count nine spiders.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: No, there’s ten. Aren’t there?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can I take your picture? I need one with a
student in it.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s what my agent tells me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ow!!!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I gotta go.</p>

<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Hey, Pete. Take a look at the act this
joker cooked up. Calls himself Bone Saw McGraw.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …don’t feel well…</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Hello, dear, how was the field trip. I
saved a nice plate for you in the oven, we had pot roast with-</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …not hungry…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …gotta sleep… everything’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Is he alright? Does he have the flu?</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: He’s seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: He’s depressed.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: He’s seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Help…..</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Peter? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine! I’m fine. Just having… had a bad
dream.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: You must be starving, you ran right past
your dinner last night, so I made an enormous breakfast. How’s your flu?
Any better this morning?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Change! Yes! Big… change!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: “…massive quantities of protein… natural
juices of their prey…”</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Something you want to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nope!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Talk to her, talk to her, talk to her, talk
to her…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hard to aim…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Weird sense… danger…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Couldn’t keep away from her, could you? You
just had to stick your camera in her face.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t want to fight you, Flash.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: I wouldn’t want to fight me either.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: What the hell is going on out here?!</p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong>: You chicken-shit, he wasn’t even
looking!</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: Flash was just standing there and Parker
sucker-punched him!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Parker? Sure he did.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I did! Really!</p>
<p><strong>i swear i did! ask ’em! i actually</strong>: DID!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m starting to like the little spazz.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: By the way… I know.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: I won’t ask what the fight was about,
that’s your business. You’re changing, and that’s normal. This is the
age when a man becomes the man he’s going to be for the rest of his
life. All I’m saying is to be careful who you change into. Okay,
pal?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m trying, Uncle Ben, I am. I feel all this,
this- -power, but I don’t know what it means, how to control it, even,
or what I’m supposed to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: You’ll figure it out. You’re one smart
cookie, Pete, your teachers tell me they’ve never seen a science whiz
like you at this age. Knowledge is power. But with great power comes
great responsibility. Remember that. “Of those to whom much is given,
much is required.” Much more than hallway fist fights.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uncle Ben, I think you’re about the best
father a guy could ever have.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Uncle, Peter. Uncle. You had a
father.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What really happened to my parents?</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Here we go again…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They worked for the government, didn’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: It was a plane crash, son. Nothing more,
and nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wish there was some way I could help you
and Aunt May the way you helped me. Maybe get a job, pay some of the
bills while you’re laid off. Aunt May’s medicine isn’t exactly free, I
mean, how are we-</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Paying bills is my job, not yours.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I just want to help.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Love you for that, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>three year old</strong>: The man crawls up his house.</p>
<p><strong>three thousand dollars</strong>: For just three minutes in
the ring! Colorful characters a must!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A spider with wings?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You didn’t have to drive me, Uncle Ben. The
train stops right across from the Library.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: I thought this’d give us a chance to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We hardly said a word!</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Who needs words?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Pick you up on this corner at six
o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Seventeen seconds?! Seventeen
seconds, ladies and gentlemen!! Is there no one who can last three
minutes in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw?</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Will the next victim please enter
the ring at this time! If he can withstand just three minutes in the
cage with Bone Saw McGraw the sum of three thousand dollars will be paid
to…</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: “Spider-Man.” Yeah, Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Three thousand dollars will be paid
to SPIDER-MAN! Will the guards please lock the cage doors!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Not a bad costume, what is that,
Spandex? I used Lycra for mine and it itches like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bone saw</strong>: COME DOWN HERE!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Okey-dokey!</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: Now get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: A hundred bucks? The ad said three
thousand!</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: Check it again, webhead. It said three
grand for three minutes. You pinned him in two. For that I’ll give you a
hundred, and you’re lucky to get it, wise ass. You made my best fighter
look like a girl out there.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: You don’t understand, it’s not for me,
it’s for my aunt, she needs this medicine, see, and-</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: A sick aunt? Are you for real? I missed
the part where this is my problem.</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: Hey! What the hell do you-</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, you! Stop that guy!</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Thanks, freak.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell’s the matter with you?! You just
had to knock him down!</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: You coulda taken that guy apart! Now he’s
gonna get away with my money!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I missed the part where this is my
problem.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: UNCLE BEN!!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Hang on, hang on!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My Uncle! That’s my uncle!</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: That’s not gonna help him!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Let the paramedics do their work!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: It was a carjacker. He’s been shot in the
chest.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, God, no!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: They’re not doing anything! Why aren’t you
doing anything?! What’s the matter with you?! Is he okay? Is he gonna be
okay? Why are you stopping?!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: He passed away, sir.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He….?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: I’m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: Hey, it just came over the radio! Patrol car
spotted the vehicle running a red light on Ninth Avenue!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: They got the guy?!</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: Not yet! He cracked up the car at the
waterfront- he’s holed up inside an abandoned factory at the river!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Which river?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: This is for the man you killed.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: In the window!</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Get some light on it!</p>
<p><strong>carjacker</strong>: Don’t hurt me! Give me a chance, man,
give me a chance!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: DID YOU GIVE HIM A CHANCE!? THE MAN YOU
KILLED?! DID YOU?! ANSWER ME!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Stop that guy!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: What the hell is that!?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: OPEN FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Don’t shoot, don’t shoot! He’s on our side,
can’t you see it, HE’S ON OUR SIDE!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: NOOOOO!!</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Always remember, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: OH GOD, PLEASE NO, I’M SORRY, UNCLE BEN,
FORGIVE ME…!!!</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: ….great responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Yeah, who the hell is he, and what’s he
doing on the front page of my newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: We sold out all four printings, Jonah.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Sold out?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Every copy.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Spider-Man, page one, tomorrow! With a
picture this time!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: We do not hit women!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: I said a picture, not an ink blot!</p>
<p><strong>can’t anybody take a decent picture</strong>: OF THAT
FREAK?!</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: You don’t have to give up your room,
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You need the extra money, you know you do.
And I’ll send more, as much as I can, as soon as I get a job.</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: College, a job, your own place… You’re not
Superman, you know.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey! What the hell do-</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: You know that isn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: That’s why we put quotes around it!</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: He’s a criminal!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What a dump.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Expensive dump.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How you gonna pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your ad mentioned a reward?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Where’d you get these?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If I tell you that, you’ll send your own
photographer next time. I want a job.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: No jobs! Free lance, Perky, best thing in
the world for a man your age, don’t get tied down! I’ll give you a
hundred bucks for the lot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A hundred?!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Deal!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No! Five hundred!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Two!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Four!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: You win. Hoffman. HOFFMAN!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s Parker, P-A-R-</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: -social security, and voluntary
contribution to that charity my wife likes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sir, if you could just put me on the payroll,
see, I really need the insurance I’d get with a full-time job, my aunt
has this condition she-</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Insurance?! What are you, a photographer or
a claims adjuster?! What happened to hard drinking and Australian bush
hats and lying to foreign women? Stick around, Kid, I’ll make a
journalist out of you, hell, HOFFMAN!, remind me to send him some
Christmas meat, NOW GET ME MORE PICTURES!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: HERO OR MENACE?!:exclusive photos!</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: I ORDERED TWICE THIS MUCH STUFF!</p>
<p><strong>who runs this town?!?</strong>: Cops Powerless Against
Spider-Man</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: How come you hate him so much?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Because he’s a vigilante! Thinks he’s above
the law! What if he turns against us someday?! It’s just a matter of
time! Look at him! Look at those eyes!</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Are you going to disappoint me?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Walk beside me, not behind.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Please don’t make me do this.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: You wanted to learn. You’ll learn.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Don’t. I just ate.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I abhor weakness. I don’t permit it in
myself; I won’t tolerate it in you. Running a company is a lot more than
handing out paychecks.</p>
<p><strong>lab worker</strong>: Dr. Ocatvius….</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Vanish.</p>
<p><strong>lab worker</strong>: It’s Mr. Osborn, sir, he’s here. In the
lab, sir.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Good morning, Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: I don’t have time for insults. What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: An update. What are you working on right
now?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Human Performance Enhancers.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Nearly there. We tried vapor inhalation
with rodent subjects, they showed an 800 percent increase in strength.
Intellectual capacity increased beyond measurable limits of testing, and
maze-solving ability became nearly instantaneous.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Excellent. Side-effects?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Propensity toward violence, central
nervous system breakdown, domination obsession, decompensation,
insanity, death.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: So they become stronger and smarter. But it
kills them. Not exactly marketable yet. The other projects?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: All good, individual airborne transports
are all tested, they look fine, hallucination orbs are good to go.
Manufacture can start in a month, we can deliver to the government by
the end of the year. You’re going to make another fortune, Norman.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: That’s what I’d hoped to hear.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: If that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dr. Octavius…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: How long have you been with the company,
Otto?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Five years. Why?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Close. Four years, three hundred and
sixty-four days. Tomorrow will be five years. Tomorrow your stock
options will vest and you will become a disturbingly wealthy man. That
would be tomorrow. Today- you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: All projects, notes, works-in- progress,
and, oh yes, unvested stock options will remain the exclusive property
of OsCorp Industries.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Norman, please, I don’t care about the
money, this work is my life!</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: And this company is mine. I made a rash
promise to you; I’d be unwise to keep it. I have shareholders to answer
to. Thank you for your service. Feel free to list me as a reference.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I said GET OUT! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Norman, stop it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Buzz off.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, wait!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, hey, right, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good, good, okay, I’m… I’m alright. What are
you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I live around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wow, I’m right here! I’m moving, though. This
is hilarious, we can’t get away from each other, huh?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yeah. Hey, I gotta take a shower and get over
to an audition, so, uh…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: An audition, that’s great, so you’re an
actress now, you’re a real actress!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yeah, I’m working steady. It’s great, you
know, I’ve never been happier. It’s like some kind of dream.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good for you. I’m going to college, Empire
State. I could have stayed at home, but after… Well, a buncha stuff
happened and money got pretty tight for my aunt, so I let her sublet my
old room and I got a job here.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Peter, I’m so sorry. I heard about your uncle,
when that happened. I’m sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You wanna, um… grab a coffee or something?
With me? I mean?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Some dream.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your stuff’s not even packed?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t have stuff, Harry, this’ll take me
about three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry I’m late, my father was inflicting
permanent psychic damage on me. That takes time, even for him. And he’s
good. What’s the matter with you? You should see your face, you look
like a pound puppy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ran into a friend.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow, yeah, that’s horrible. Dude, lighten up?
This is the day you kiss this dump goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You sure you’ve got room for me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think I can squeeze you in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, my…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Eh? Eh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m gonna live here?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can’t beat the rent.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is too generous. You’ve gotta let me pay
you my share.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. Your share is half of what I pay, so
you owe me… hang on, let me run the numbers… nothing. My dad bought it
for me, for God’s sake! A three bedroom apartment in the middle of
Manhattan? If I don’t give a room to somebody I’ll go to hell. You’re
saving my soul.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I insist. I’m totally broke as usual, but I
want to pay something.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, all you have to do is meet the old
bastard and make him like you, and believe me, that’ll be payment
enough. He’s coming by tomorrow, after the parade. Hey, you wanna come
to the parade with me? My dad got me tickets, great seats.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks, but I’ve gotta work the parade.
Taking pictures.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pete, there’s something I gotta tell you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is it? Aren’t you gonna…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, I just… yeah. I… oh, hell. Hang on a
second.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hey, Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You remember M.J., don’t you, Pete? Peter
Parker, Mary Jane Watson. Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parker. Peter Watson,
Mary Parker Jane…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Can’t keep away from one another, right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So we, um, M.J. and me, I mean, uh, obviously
we, uh- kinda got back together again.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Great! ’Scuse me a sec.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I had to do it, man, she’s all I thought
about for the past year. I couldn’t get her out of my mind. She drives
me insane, Dude, just look at her…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why would I care?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I mean, I know you, uh-</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Harry, I really don’t know what you mean. I’m
happy for you. Woah, I gotta get to work.</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Osborn…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Who… who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: I am the voice you refuse to hear… The
dream you’re afraid to remember…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: To say what you won’t… To do what you
can’t…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: You already know…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: A threat to the company.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Don’t talk like that!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: One day he will destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Don’t say these things!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Lay waste to your grandfather’s
company…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Unless he’s stopped. Before it’s too
late.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: That isn’t true!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: You believe it is.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I’ve never thought that!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: You think that every day.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: But he’s- my God, he’s-</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Abraham was willing… he had the
strength… so too do I.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: What are you going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Protect the company…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: God, no, no, please-</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Find the weak link.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: HE’S MY SON!!!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Break it in two.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Isn’t it great?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Ah! Yes, that one is Snoopy, a sort of
devil-may-care dog who flies his doghouse around and pretends to be a
World War I pilot.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Oh, here comes Garfield, my favorite!
Garfield is a wonderful sort of, uh, sarcastic cat. “Sarcastic cat?”
Don’t you have a word for that?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I, uh… I’m not familiar with that one, it
must be new this year.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: I CAN’T SEE!!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Get out of my way or I’ll destroy
you!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: “Get out of my way or I’ll destroy you,
please.”</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: That… is MINE!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: I’m warning you, Spider-Man! I’m no
purse snatcher or chain-grabber! I am like you! I am more than you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: M.J.!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: M.J.!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll get help!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: No! Don’t leave me here!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Thank God! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: HANG ON!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I knew you’d call!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: I may not be able to kill you,
Spider-Man… but if it’s the last thing I do, I’ll make you wish you were
dead!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: This is where you get off.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I… got to go…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hey! Don’t I get to say thank you this
time?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: I really gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How come? Got a Mrs. Spider-Man waiting
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dad! You’re early.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Happy Thanksgiving to you too.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re not going to believe what happened at
the parade! M.J. and I were almost…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I know. I heard all about it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m fine. Really. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m fine too. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Harry, I know I’ve… let you down. On
occasion. In the past.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks, Dad. Hey, why don’t we have a
Thanksgiving dinner? I didn’t make anything, but the three of us could
go out.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Can’t today, working. But I’d be happy to
pick up your check. Where’s this new tenant of ours? I’m afraid I need
to meet him and go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’s not a tenant. He goes to school with me.
He’s you know, an amigo.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s weird, I didn’t know he was here.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Tell him we don’t have maid service.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you see it? Did you see what happened?
Man, I hope I got a decent picture!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pete, there you are. This is my father,
Norman Osborn.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh! Pleasure to meet you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Broken glass. Landed on it.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You landed on it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I’m an idiot. I was trying to get a
picture of that thing in the sky and I stepped right out in front of a
taxi. Must have knocked me twenty feet.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Better have me take a look at it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just a… few cuts and scrapes. I’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I really should be going. Harry?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: A word to the not-so-wise. That little tart
will be gone at the first sign of trouble and she’ll take half your
trust fund with her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I’m not finished.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Thanks for standing up for me, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He just doesn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You know what? He’s right. I don’t know what
I’m doing with you either. That creep is right.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That “creep” is my father! If I’m lucky, I’ve
got the brains and the guts to become half of what he is, so you just
watch your mouth, you little-</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You’re becoming somebody’s father, all right.
Mine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: M.J., wait, you’ve got to understand
Harry-</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I do, better than I ever have. Twice today, I
needed him, really needed him, and he wasn’t there. I need, I need-
look, I don’t have a clue what I need, okay? There isn’t a person on
this earth who knows me, including me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know you. I grew up six feet away from you.
I knew when you were happy, I knew when things were bad- you’d play
Nirvana. I’d lie in bed and listen to you crying. “All alone is all we
are.” Well, you’re not alone, okay? You never have been. I want you to
know that.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: There’s only one guy who’s ever been there
when I needed him. And he wears a leotard. God, I’m a mess.</p>
<p><strong>happy freaks-giving!</strong>: Spider-Man, Green Goblin
Terrorize City!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: You like that, “Green Goblin?” Made it up
myself. Ever since Spider-Man, they all gotta have a name. HOFFMAN! Call
the patent office and copyright the name Green Goblin! I want a quarter
every time somebody says it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Spider-Man wasn’t terrorizing the city, he
was trying to save it! How could you say that, it’s libel!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: What are you, his lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s slander!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: So let him sue me, and get rich like a
normal person, that’s what makes this country GAAAACK!</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: I am Otto Octavius. Where is Peter
Parker?</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: He isn’t here! He’s a free-lancer, we don’t
even know where he lives!</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m Peter Parker.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: The man in the mask, the “Green Goblin.”
Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: I HAVE BUSINESS WITH HIM! WHO IS HE?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. I never saw his face.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: How did you get that picture?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Got lucky. Right place at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: I’ll be watching you, Peter Parker. In
case you’re ever “lucky” again.</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: Next time call for an appointment, Doctor…
Doctor… Octopus.</p>
<p><strong>octavius</strong>: Don’t call me that!</p>
<p><strong>jameson</strong>: City just isn’t the same since Rudy’s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Peter Parker…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: …Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be
thy name.</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: FINISH IT! FINISH IT!</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: …DELIVER US FROM EVIL!!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: M.J. She just broke up with me, man. She
scraped me off her shoe. She’s in love with somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wonder.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get that innocent look off your face, you
can’t pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re way out of line, man, you’re paranoid.
You don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re not finished. Hello. Yeah? What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sorry… I should have been there with you…
I should have been there…</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: Those eyes… the devil’s eyes…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whose eyes? Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>aunt may</strong>: …horrible yellow eyes!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Peter… Parker?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you kidding? He tries to deny it, but
he’s been in love with her since he was twelve years old.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Reeeeeally. What a… tangled web.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry. You must think I’m so weak. Oh
God, Dad, you hate me… I know you hate me.</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Harry… no, Harry, you mustn’t say that, you
mustn’t ever say that. Whatever’s happened with us in the past, it
doesn’t matter. I love you. I love you and I’ll do anything I can to
help you.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Will she be okay?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I been there. I know it feels like your fault.
I thought it was my fault when my dad left, but it wasn’t. You’re good
to her. That’s all you can be. You’re good to everyone, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is this, an audition?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you trying out for a new part? The best
friend? That’s what you’re about to tell me, isn’t it? You respect me,
you admire me, you love me, as a friend. Right?! Don’t bother with that
speech, M.J., I’ve heard it plenty of times before.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hey, wait, I…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you knew the first thing about me, you’d,
you’d… if I could just tell you…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Peter? Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Keep away from me. I love- people get hurt.
That’s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dad? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Be… right down… son.</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Those ungrateful brats!</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Did they think they could treat an
Osborn this way? Did they dream there would not be hell to pay?</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: Leave my son alone!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Not just the idiot son, Osborn… the
harlot as well… the interloper… All three of them… They must be
dispatched. From a great height…</p>
<p><strong>osborn</strong>: I am Norman Osborn, I am Norman Osborn, I am
Norman Osborn…</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Norman is weak… Norman’s a waste…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Relax, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This isn’t possible…</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: It’s a dream, Pete. You’re still back at
home. You fell asleep on the sofa, it’s about seven in the morning.
You’re gonna wake up in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uncle Ben… Oh God, I’m sorry, I’m so sor-</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s so much I want to ask you, so much I
want to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: I’ve only got a minute or two, before the
doorbell wakes you up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I love her, Uncle Ben.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: I know you do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All I’d have to do is tell her, tell her who
I really am, and she’d-</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Be pretty easy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure would.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: So why don’t you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because she wouldn’t be safe a single minute
for the rest of her life.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: Is that why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Partly.</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: She needs to love you, Pete. Not the guy
in the mask. But burning that mask isn’t the way to protect her, or
yourself. You can’t deny who you are, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who I am? Because of who I am, you were
killed. Aunt May almost- who’s next? How can I be sure no one else will
get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>uncle ben</strong>: You can’t. It’s called life. You can’t
bet on it, you can’t manage it or control it, all you can do is lead the
one you were meant to live.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Peter Parker?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well? What do you want?</p>

<p><strong>peter</strong>: Danger!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The elevator! Don’t go in it!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Fine, stay down here and die!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: PETER!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: PETER!!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Can I wear it home?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re in love with someone else. I’ve got a
right to know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Harry, for God’s-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: WHO IS HE?</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Goodbye, children! Time to throw you
from the nest!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Do you like my razor bats?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Hang on, hang on!!</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: Thought you’d never see me again, didn’t
you Osborn?!</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: I’ve awaited this moment, Norman!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stop him! Please!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’s my father…</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: NOOOO!!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: M.J.!!!!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: LET’S SEE HOW THIS SPIDER FLIES!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: Don’t play your death scene yet, my
little actress! Let’s stop somewhere you’ll have an audience!</p>
<p><strong>construction workers</strong>: ALL RIIIIIGHT!!!</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: No! Don’t arrest him!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: WHY LOOK! IT’S YOUR BOYFRIEND, COMING
TO DIE WITH YOU!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: HAPPY TO SEE YOU!</p>
<p><strong>green goblin</strong>: HOW ABOUT SEEING ME?!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Watch out! Don’t let him-</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: KILL HIM! KILL HIM!</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: NOOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: M.J.!!</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: PULL UP, PULL UP, PULL UP!!!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Kiss me now.</p>
<p><strong>doc ock</strong>: He’s alive! You fool, you left him alive!
Spider-Man!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: SPIIIIIIDERRRMAAAAAANNNN!!!!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: ….SPIDER-MAN….</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks for everything, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too, Buddy. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re sort of orphans, aren’t we? What do we
have left?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Us too? Friends again?</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: Tell her. Tell her.</p>
<p><strong>spider-man</strong>: But I can’t. I will never forget these
words: “With great power comes great responsibility.”</p>
