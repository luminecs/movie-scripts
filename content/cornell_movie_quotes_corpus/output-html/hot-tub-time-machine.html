<p><strong>blue skies. a beautiful sunny day.</strong>: CAMERA PANS DOWN
to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN BIKINIS. They splash about
playfully. Then–</p>
<p><strong>a fucking lion jumps in the hot tub!</strong>: As the girls
SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS and it becomes the:</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Ready for the wildest bachelor party of all
time? LILY walks in the room, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know it. I’m gonna bang all sorts of
chicks this weekend!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: That’s not the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee
a playful kiss. She shows him some PHOTOS.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Look what I found…</p>
<p><strong>angle: photo</strong>: A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS
PARTY IN A LARGE HOT TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun
ever.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Check out that young stud. Can you believe
he’s about to get married? Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a
YOUNG ADAM partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS: – In full 80s SKI
GEAR on a mountain… – Eating PIZZA at “Papa Enzo’s,” stuffing their
faces… – Drinking BEERS at the “Brew Haus,” an awesome pub… – In the HOT
TUB with SIX GIRLS… Adam snatches the last photo from her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ignore that one. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>****: I love you. Lily laughs.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Adam, you didn’t know me yet. As Adam goes
back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of the photos. She stops
at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Who’s this? Lily shows Adam a PHOTO: – A
SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY .</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Really? Lily shows Adam another PHOTO: – YOUNG
ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks like she was ambushed
for the photo.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh! Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Who’s Jennie?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s nobody. Ski instructor. You didn’t know
me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and a face. Of
course I’m gonna take her picture. Lily still looks a little
bothered.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Do you still think of her?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to
EMBRACE her:</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Hold on… Lily goes into the CLOSET.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sweetie? She comes out a moment later with a
CARDBOARD BOX, which she empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO
MAGAZINES spill out, ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How did you know where I hid my… treasure?
Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it by the
corner, not wanting to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Explain this. From ADAM’S POV, we see the
brochure: – A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK! You caught me! I occasionally… reminisce…
about Jennie O’Keefe!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: That’s gross.</p>
<p>****: What’s “occasionally?”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: About two hours ago when you were on the phone
with your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Jesus. Tell me how I’m supposed to let you go
to your bachelor party and not be a basket case?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you so worried about?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I’m worried that you’re still thinking about
this girl.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing
more than a crush. I could never get her and there’s no possibility I’ll
ever be with her. She was a total stranger. Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on
her face.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So… you’re into strangers?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well not the creepy “your mom was in an
accident, now come with me” kind. But yeah, the hot lady in the
supermarket kind of stranger. You have to admit - it’s kinda hot.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So you’re saying if you and I didn’t know each
other, it would be pretty hot if we fooled around?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You kidding me? It would be fucking
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait a minute. Are you suggesting… yes. YES!
Adam excitedly heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK, I’ll go down the hall. You get into
character. This fucking rules. Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER
SHIRT, talking sexy and slowly building the fantasy…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh I’m all alone in this big house.
Cheerleading camp just ended and I need to get out of these sweaty
clothes…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Love where you’re going with this, baby! Keep
it up! She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Mmmm. My panties are so tight against my firm
naked body…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You should probably take them off!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Are you gonna let me do this?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry! Continue! You were just about to take
off your panties! She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them
away. Now she’s TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It feels so good to be so naked. I hope no one
can see me… Just then a BLACK MAN saunters through the bedroom door,
holding a coffee and all riled up.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: OK, so this asshole in front of me at the
donut place is – WHOA! Lily covers up and SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Get out of here!! He SPILLS the coffee on his
hands and their rug as he turns.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Fuck! Ow! I’m sorry. I’ll clean it up.
That’s gonna stain, though.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Just leave! He heads for the door, just as:
Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Special delivery for – Jesus Christ! The black
man doesn’t know which way to look. He covers his eyes and drips coffee,
as he blindly steps toward the door.</p>
<p>****: Just tell me when I’m in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I can’t wait for you to come back and marry
me. Wow, that’s crazy. Adam looks almost like it just hit him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>****: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Tell me again I have nothing to worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Babe, look at Nick… In the car, Nick air drums
to whatever’s on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You think with him in charge, we’re gonna get
into any kind of trouble? We’ll probably eat too much pizza and I’ll
twist my ankle getting off the ski lift.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: OK. Have an awesome bachelor party. Not too
awesome. I got you something. Adam looks in the bag.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK.
She looks like she was expecting a different reaction, but she lets it
go. He kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Let me see your phone. He takes it out.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I told you, I’ll call you when– She snatches
it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Despite my anxiety, I’m not gonna be one of
those women who wants an update every ten minutes. Even though I do want
an update every ten minutes. Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit
trepidatious.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Just make sure whatever happens, you’re back
for the rehearsal dinner.</p>
<p>****: I totally trust you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You should. I’m a lame-o.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Well at least you’re a cute lame-o. Lily leans
in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a disgusting display of
affection. A FLASH goes off. From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m more than willing to forget about earlier,
but this shit’s going on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have no idea what Facebook is. My phone has
a button that says Send To Facebook. I’ve been sending shit there for
months. Adam looks out the window, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m so psyched about this weekend!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ditto, buddy. I’m gonna help you make up for
all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member
of society.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re a good friend. I’m sorry for putting my
career and self sufficiency above bowling night.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This trip represents everything awesome about
being a dude.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re gonna drink too much, eat whatever we
want…</p>
<p>****: I might not even change my socks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Live the dream.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Best of all, we don’t have to answer to
anyone. Nick’s PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in
BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more “sensitive.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi honey.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Three goddamn bags of pretzels?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m with Adam, honey.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Hi Adam. Nick, what have I told you about
buying snacks that aren’t on sale?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You said not to do it.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: And what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I bought three bags of pretzels. But I’m gonna
eat them…</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p>****: Don’t do it again. Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing
glance.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Call me from the road. Adam, say hi to
Lily.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK, I sure wi– CLICK. For a moment, there is
an uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t her parents own the supermarket?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The whole damn chain.</p>
<p>****: Just be thankful Lily doesn’t have any family money. Nothing
makes your dick softer.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This looks like a place where people die.
Mostly from murder. A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s exits
a room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat. Adam looks
happy to see him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lou!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes, I’m living in a transient motel. Let’s get
that purple elephant out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Dude, it looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Thank you. I hate your guts.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’d you bring?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: All my belongings.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So you’re sorta like a bum now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: In a sense.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Our system is fucked, gentlemen. You tell me
how a whore wife can fuck some black dude - no offense - and still take
her cuckold of a husband for all he’s got.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why would I take offense to that?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It’s offensive.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Because he’s black?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: And because he’s fucking my wife. And because
you’re black. And because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage… you
know what? Forget no offense. Just offense. Are you offended?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Then shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s got a hell of an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes and thank you so very much for giving her
the referral.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She told me it was for a friend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So… what? Your wife likes black dick now?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m gonna slaughter you in your sleep
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thanks for coming, man.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh, Adam’s stupid brother’s coming? Boo! Drive
away before he gets in the car!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Be nice. I know Jacob’s kind of a douche, but
I’m trying to be closer to him since Mom died. Jacob gets in the back
next to Lou.</p>
<p>****: Hey buddy! How’s it going? Good to see you!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You look dirty and you smell bad.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You look gay and you smell like a basket of
fancy soaps. Advantage me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How is that to your advantage?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He’s not gay. He’s just… what are you
again?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Metrosexual.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You have sex with trains?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: For your information, I fuck chicks. Hot
ones.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: For your information, you fuck dudes. Gay
ones.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, well at least I’m young and my life’s
full of potential. I hear you’re homeless now?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You told him?!</p>
<p>****: I hate all you people.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Will you two please shake hands and make up?
We’re gonna be spending a lot of time together. Jacob distractedly TEXTS
on his phone.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, about that. Why aren’t we going to
Aspen? Vermont’s lame.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s gonna be fun.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, whatever. And with that, the guys
travel in silence for a few moments, the lifeblood drained from the car.
Finally…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’ve gotta take a shit.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That was an ugly experience.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t wanna hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: In a few years, when I’m dying of an exotic
disease that causes my penis to bleed until it falls off, someone
remember to tell the hospital to check out the filthy crapper at the
Albany Rest Stop. It’s the AIDS monkey of toilets. The guys put down
their sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t know how you’re doing it, man. I mean,
Laurie’s hot, don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p>****: Lily.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Right. Lily. But one vagina? Forever?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s the sacrifice. Jacob nods, agreeing
with Lou’s concern.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: And you’re OK with that? I don’t know your
sexual history, but you sure you got it out of your system?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I did OK for myself.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: He didn’t do that well for himself.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, isn’t Lily your fourth?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fifth. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: So you’re averaging like one girl every eight
years.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Assuming I got laid when I was zero.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That would be awesome. Adam gives Lou a
distasteful look.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m fine. Maybe some cold feet, but that’s
normal. Thank you everyone for your concern.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Just looking out for you. That’s what
brothers do, right? They look out for each other?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is this about something else?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, let’s do this. I’m sorry I wasn’t around
when you were growing up, OK? I was in college. And then I was working.
Dad left. Someone had to take responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Boooooring!</p>
<p>****: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I said forget it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Guys, come on. Let’s move past it. This is
gonna be a fun weekend.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I still say Vermont sucks.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re confusing Vermont with yourself. This
weekend is going to be incredible and you will not ruin it for me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You might like it. Havenhurst is pretty
awesome. Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck yeah it is! We’re gonna ski the trail and
bone some tail!</p>
<p>****: You’ll have to bone some of that tail for me, man.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck that. You’ll bone your own.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of my life -
not fucking a whore at my bachelor party.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s the biggest mistake of your life?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck yeah. And he’s not making that same
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh… I’m not having sex with anyone this
weekend. Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Ohhhh. I gotcha.</p>
<p>****: You’re not having sex this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not having sex this weekend. Without the
winking.</p>
<p>****: Right. No winking.</p>
<p>****: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m pretty sure you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gentlemen… welcome to Havenhurst.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: so this is the coolest town ever?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF Chang’s. Lou
notices a TGI Friday’s, with a sign advertising a “Hannah Montana 3-D
Experience!” He looks utterly disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t even have the heart to tell you what I
just fucking saw. But say goodbye to Papa Enzo’s. This town sucks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What the fuck is going on? The car climbs a
twisty part of the road.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Please god let it still be there…</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Pink Paradise. Best strip club ever. The car
rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The beginning reads
“Pink.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes! It lives! The car continues to climb and
the whole sign comes into view: “Pinkberry.”</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I wanna die.</p>
<p>****: Sweet, there’s a Pinkberry here.</p>
<p>****: What have you done to us?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not playing drinking games with my
grandma.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK so the place skews a little older. Let’s
check in. We’re not spending our time inside anyway.</p>
<p>****: Hey buddy. I’m not gonna tell you again. I fuckin’ got it. Adam
backs off.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This guy’s a dick.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No, fuck that.</p>
<p>****: He’s a dick. Oooh tough guy. He’s gotta be Mister America.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Captain America.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Go fuck yourself. Phil finally drops their bags
at their room and then:</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m ready to be tipped.</p>
<p>****: You, sir, have no tact. Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off
down the hall, leaving the guys outside their room.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gentlemen… in this room lies the beginning of
our awesome weekend.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Or a continuation of everything that’s sucked
so far.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah, I bet it’s gonna be lame as shit in
there. The furniture probably smells like mold.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I say we go to Foxwoods.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I actually kinda like that idea.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Guys! Everyone looks at Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s give it a chance. We don’t know for sure
that the room sucks. Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the
door:</p>
<p>****: OK, so now we know. The guys drag their bags in and
depressingly take stock of the situation – presently the dirty old
room.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell is with this place?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It’s like a Stephen King novel, except not as
cool.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’ll feel a lot better once we hit the
slopes.</p>
<p>****: Plus, I know there’s one thing to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Thank. God.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: At least some things never change.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s the big deal about a hot tub?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Shame on you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s plenty of time for tubbin’. Let’s
ski.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: When’s the last time you guys actually went
skiing?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s been a few years.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think we look good.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Then you’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All right, we race down the mountain. Loser
buys first round. Premium shit only.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You gonna be all right?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I dunno - do black dudes ski?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course black dudes ski. Aren’t I wearing
skis?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m just not sure you’re representative.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re calling me an Uncle Tom?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t even know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It means black dudes ski. Catch ya at the
bottom. Nick takes off and… gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a GRASSY
PATCH and falls over.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Black dudes don’t ski.</p>
<p>****: How’s the bottom?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, the black ones… without the pleats…
Because the pleats make me look fat… No, I put it on the Amex… Because
I’m the best man… I know, but I’m organizing… I’m gonna get cash fr– I’m
gonna get– I’m gonna collect cash from the guys… Yes… Yes… Yes.</p>
<p>****: I love you too. Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and
Jacob have been walking with him, listening to his end of the
conversation.</p>
<p>****: Dude…</p>
<p>****: OK, who’s ready to sink their teeth into a delicious
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>aiden</strong>: You fellas look like you can handle some
spice. I’m gonna knock it up a bit… throw some chili sauce in there… oh
yeah, there it is. This is gonna knock your socks off.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you. The waiter walks away and Nick
RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’d like to propose a toast. To my best
friend, Adam. He may be throwing his life away, but at least he’s
throwing it away with a hot chick at his side. The guys LAUGH and clink
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And so what if you only have one vagina for
the rest of your life. Speaking as someone who’s seen your wife’s vagina
– it’s definitely one of the good ones. Lou and Jacob look confused, but
clink glasses anyway, as Adam mouths “What the fuck” to Nick. Jacob
raises his glass.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: To my brother, I say thank you for including
me. I promise to try to make the most of it. The guys look confused at
the backhanded graciousness.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thanks for coming, man. It means a lot to me.
Jacob nods halfheartedly.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To Adam!</p>
<p><strong>guys</strong>: To Adam! The guys hug and clink glasses and
excitedly CHATTER. Just then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS
HIS THROAT.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Gentlemen. You’re going to have to keep it
down.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, man. It’s our friend’s bachelor
party. We’re just trying to roast him a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well if you like roasts, I suggest the
roast peking duck. It’s out of this world and as I’m sure Aiden has told
you, he can make it quite spicy. The guys look bothered.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: But as for the noisy kind of roast, that’s
going to have to stop. We have many other guests trying to enjoy the
P.F. Chang’s experience. The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys
are quiet. Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This kung pau chicken pairs very nicely with
the 97 cab. Very impressive choice, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Also, this is the worst bachelor party I’ve
ever been to. Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Totally agree.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nick, look. You had great intentions. No one’s
blaming you.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m blaming him.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m totally blaming him. I didn’t even want
to go skiing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK I’ll admit this trip is not off to the best
start. But we’re due for a victory! Nick thinks and actually gets an
idea. He SNAPS his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hot tub! A lightbulb goes off for Adam
too.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes! Lou gets up and throws down his
napkin.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Why did we even bother with dinner? Adam and
Nick get up too.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Guys, I’m still hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Quiet, men are talking. Aiden approaches.</p>
<p><strong>aiden</strong>: Get you guys some to-go boxes?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I would like you to die. And then I would like
you to leave. Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the
guys.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It’s tub time.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh my god. The water is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I really don’t see the appeal. It’s like a
glorified bath.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the whole thing!
You ski all day. Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine
ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin’. Nick
CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So the town’s dead? Fine, we skip that part
and go right to the tub. Trust me. If there’s fun to be had, the tub is
a good start. Nick gets in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes! It’s amazing. Now it’s just Jacob outside
the hot tub. The other three guys are already starting to look more
energized and happy, splashing around. After another beat of
consideration…</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Fuck it. Jacob strips down and gets in. As he
submerges, he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not convinced this is anything more than
a bath, but it’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hit him with some bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Coming right up. Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the
BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a TUBBIN’ MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real’s “I
Like to Move It.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh my god, I wanna die.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I need a vitamin water. Adam reaches in his
backpack, taking out two choices.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Red Bull or Fresca? Jacob takes the Fresca, as
Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That fucking bear got me good.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah he did.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: But we showed him, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he
got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah,
we got him good.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck yeah. Lou picks up Adam’s half-eaten
sandwich and takes a BITE.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You just puked.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That’s why I’m eating your sandwich. I’m
fucking starving.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Guys, look… Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN
PEAK, on which is a fresh LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is this, a shitty car club? The guys
COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET: – “Coming soon: the
most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!</p>
<p><strong>spaceballs!“</strong>: – A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF
COKE and the tag: “Catch the Wave!” – A bull terrier named SPUDS
MCKENZIE parking with some HOT BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well this place has improved. – In the lift
line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Really, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m really glad we stayed. It’s gonna be good
to get away for a couple of days.</p>
<p>****: I mean not like I want to be away from Lily. You know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Believe me I know.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I love her. But you guys are right. I’m gonna
be with her for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>****: For the rest of your goddamn life.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It gets easier, right? No offense, but
watching you talk with Courtney-</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re gonna be fine. You’ll settle in, get
the premium cable package - the usual deal. Adam nods.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’ll wake up every morning, comforted by the
fact that your wife doesn’t wield her family’s wealth over your head
like a hangman’s noose. Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes
on…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’ll breathe the air of life, making the
occasional decision - maybe get some lawn furniture. How about steak for
dinner? Yes, let’s get that juice machine I saw on TV. Let’s fucking go
for it. Nick stares off into the distance.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry, I lost myself there.</p>
<p><strong>dude in sunglasses</strong>: Coke? Adam and Nick look at the
guy across from them, who presently offers his SKI GOGGLES, on which is
a mountain of COCAINE.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That is a lot of cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I feel like we’re in Scarface. Only with
skiing.</p>
<p>****: Skiface.</p>
<p>****: Take it. It’s good shit.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m gonna pass.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I’m good. The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead
look in his eyes, studying Nick and Adam.</p>
<p><strong>dude in sunglasses</strong>: You guys a couple of
spazzes?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Spazzes?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You Miami Vice? Which one’s
Crockett? Which one’s CROCKETT?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m Crockett, obviously!</p>
<p>****: That’s the Don Johnson one, right? The dude flips out a
SWITCHBLADE.</p>
<p><strong>dude in sunglasses</strong>: You show me you’re not
spazzes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re not spazzes. The dude extends the coke
once more.</p>
<p><strong>dude in sunglasses</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Adam, you gotta chill. You just did one
line.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve never ridden the horse before.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re not riding the horse. The horse is
heroin. Adam can’t stop moving and fidgeting.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t know what kind of animal I’m riding,
but it’s the best animal of all time. I feel great! Adam uses his SKI
POLES to push off the top of the mountain and he goes FLYING DOWN THE
SLOPE.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Adam! Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>further up the mountain</strong>: Nick has to pull up and
slow down in the name of safety.</p>
<p><strong>on adam</strong>: He zips along, never changing course or
slowing. He BARELY MISSES a few TREES. But he can’t stop himself before
–</p>
<p><strong>he barrels into a smoking hot chick!</strong>: The collision
knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and finally stops Adam’s
hyper-speed descent. Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What a rush! He notices the girl on the ground
and goes to help her up.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh wow, are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>smoking hot chick</strong>: No thanks to you, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>in slow motion –</strong>: The girl stands up in a very hot
and awesome manner, SHAKING THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It
twinkles in the sunlight. As she turns to face Adam, NORMAL SPEED
RESUMES. And he sees who it is:</p>
<p>****: Jennie O’Keefe! Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place
him.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Do I know you? He stares at her, not
believing what he’s seeing. He still looks loopy from the coke. Just
then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered hair,
striped-jumpsuited guy SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I’m gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich,
airhead.</p>
<p>****: You all right, babe?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Your lift ticket’s been revoked. Blaine
throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Diplomatic immunity. Blaine looks confused, as
Adam RIPS Blaine’s lift ticket, but he ends up RIPPING BLAINE’S JACKET
too.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry, I was trying to… you can probably patch
that up. Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his
fist.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You’re dead meat, scumbag. Just then, SNOW
POWDER flies in Blaine’s face. Blaine lets go of Adam, as Jacob
snowboards up and stops short, coming to his brother’s side.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: There you are! My brother’s had a few too
many triple Venti nonfat lattes if you know what I mean. Are you OK?
Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look enamored with
Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Dude, they let you bring a skateboard on the
mountain?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s a snowboard. You know - no wheels.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Genius! Man, not to get all fag on you, but I’m
digging your fresh threads, bro. Adam and Blaine look equally confused
with what’s going on. Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves
it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Thank you. It’s mostly North Face. A little
EMS.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Whatever it is, it works.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Totally. What are you doing with this boner?
You should be skiing with us. Like permanently. Blaine looks really
annoyed with his friends.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Guys!</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: I mean, that’s if Blaine thinks it’s cool and
everything. Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.</p>
<p>****: Get your spaz brother out of here. And for his sake, I don’t
wanna see him back on my mountain.</p>
<p>****: You’re welcome any time though! Adam picks up his BACKPACK,
which fell off during the collision. He stares at Jennie again and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You look JUST like this girl. I had the
biggest crush on her– Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam’s hand and SHOVES
ADAM away.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: This is mine now. Adam looks at Blaine
angrily, but Jacob holds him back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Come on. Let’s just go. Jacob ushers Adam off
the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What is going on? Lou strolls up to the guys,
with his arms around TWO HOT CHICKS. He looks elated.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Guys! I’m so glad you’re here. I want to
introduce you to Michelle and Sandy. These lovely ladies are having a
roller skating party next weekend and no offense, but fuck your wedding
– I’m totally coming back. By the way… Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full
of cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: There’s coke everywhere around here. This place
rules! Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Has anyone else noticed that things around
here are weird as shit? Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Don’t you ruin this. If you wake me from this
dream, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p>****: What do you think happened?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I have no idea, but look… Jacob turns up the
VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
just above 2,000 today…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m ruined!</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: In other news, the Tower Commission has
rebuked President Reagan for not controlling his national security staff
in an arms-for- hostages deal with Iran… For a moment, the guys sit
there in stunned silence. Then…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We’re in 1971.</p>
<p>****: We’re in 1987. Everyone looks stunned and dazed.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What are we gonna do? I have plans next
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We all have plans. It’s my fucking
wedding!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Now hold on, we don’t know for sure that we’re
in 1987. The TV shows a COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a
JINGLE that SINGS: “Are you keeping up with the Commodore, ’cause the
Commodore’s keeping up with you…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK, we’re in 1987. Adam stands up, completely
losing it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and
calmly takes charge.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Everyone relax. I think I know what’s
happened. And when we’re done discussing it, we’re all gonna feel a lot
better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Two words: black hole. He lets it hang in the
air for a moment, as if it’s suddenly going to gel for everyone. But the
guys look confused.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I saw a special on the Science Channel. And
guess what? Sometimes this happens.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This happens?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to
stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this
little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his
know-it-all-ness.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is a big glitch.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, you’re an idiot. Black holes are in
space. Not at a ski resort.</p>
<p>****: So does this mean we get to go to girls’ locker rooms and see
them naked and they can’t see us?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, we traveled through time. We’re not
invisible. Lou looks upset.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m still gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we
got here for a moment–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Black hole.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How are we supposed to get back? For a moment,
everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We find a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the
real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.</p>
<p><strong>man in suit</strong>: Gentlemen, how may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re waiting for a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>man in suit</strong>: I am a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Where’s your white coat?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: I’m not that kind of scientist.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This is bullshit! I told you–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait a minute. Just tell him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK. You tell him, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sir, we…</p>
<p>****: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Nothing’s too ridiculous in the name of
science.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: We’re from the future.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That went well. Lou starts walking off by
himself.</p>
<p>****: Where are you going? Lou points to his watch.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Five o’clock. Happy hour. The guys look at him,
confused.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: If it’s ’87, the PF Chang’s will be gone, which
means the Brew Haus still stands.</p>
<p>****: It’s Saturday. They have wet T- shirt contests on
Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, maybe one drink. Just to confirm.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Holy shit. It’s that bellhop.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Should we warn him?</p>
<p>****: I don’t want to see this go down. Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN
THE AIR and… He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A
GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck that guy. ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete
for wettest t-shirt. They both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest
option.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: God bless our country.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’re in 1987.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You can stop saying that. I don’t think it’s
making a difference.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Seriously, we have to get back. We seriously
have to get back! The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one Bartles
and James. The guys all stare at her like she’s a museum artifact.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What? I have lipstick on my teeth? Nick
sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, if it’s available, I’m ordering it. I
always wanted one of these when I was little. The waitress puts down the
CHECK. Jacob picks it up, realizing something.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Can you give us a second? She walks away, as
Jacob turns to the guys.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This is gonna be a problem. He takes out his
wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Guys, we’re in trouble. Our cards aren’t
gonna work and our new money looks fake. The guys look concerned, but
then Nick notices something:</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve got an idea. As Nick gets up and
approaches the businessmen, Adam looks around the room and by the bar,
he spots –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I still can’t believe it’s really her!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: She’s aged remarkably well.</p>
<p>****: Oh, right. Why don’t you just go talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I should go talk to her. To apologize, of
course. You know, nothing inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Sure… Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way
over across the room. Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam
approaches. He lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices
him, as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn’t look happy.</p>
<p>****: Listen putz, if you’re gonna try to attack me again, my
boyfriend will be here soon. He’ll kick your ass. Adam tries to be
casual.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, no. No ass kicking. I just wanted to say
I’m sorry about earlier. I lost control of the old skis there.</p>
<p>****: Looks like I shoulda taken another one of your classes!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: When did you take my class?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Certainly not when I was a kid! I mean, that
would make no sense! Adam tries to recover.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was here for a convention. Power tools. And
regular tools. All sorts of tools. I’m big into tools. It was a couple
years ago. Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah, OK. Have a good night. Jennie starts
to walk away with her friends.</p>
<p>****: Hey, where ya going? She ignores him, but one of her friends
quietly lags behind.</p>
<p><strong>jennie’s friend</strong>: Are you with that guy over there?
She discretely points out Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, he’s my brother. She takes Adam’s PALM
and writes something on it.</p>
<p><strong>jennie’s friend</strong>: There’s a party later tonight at
this address. Make sure he comes with you. He’s way boss! Adam walks
back to his friends.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How’d it go? He shows them his palm.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We got invited to a party later.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: sweet! What are we gonna do until then?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How about figure out how the hell to get back
to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile
of CASH.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Bam!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We’re millionaires!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Close. It’s a thousand bucks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where did you get that money? Nick points out
the Japanese Businessmen.</p>
<p>****: Sold them my iPod. Jacob looks incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That was NOT a good idea!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I agree. You left so much money on the table.
It’s a fucking iPod! You could’ve gotten a LOT more!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s not what I–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fellas, we are not making progress and we’re
losing time.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Adam, don’t worry. Time’s not moving forward
in the future.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the lessons
learned from Bill and Ted.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well then I give you Back to the Future.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s not fair. You can’t go right to Back
to the Future.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Back to the Future had a time machine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well so did Bill and Ted.</p>
<p>****: Wait, that’s it! I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I
think we have a time machine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Adam, all we did is get drunk in the hot tub.
Everyone’s EYES GO WIDE.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: A hot tub time machine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Here goes nothing! They simultaneously DOWN
their drinks. Nothing happens. Like the chimps in 2001, each of them
begins FIDDLING WITH KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the
magic button. After a few moments:</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, it was worth a shot. ANGLE WIDENS to
reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND GIRL make out, two STONERS
pass a joint, and one TOPLESS CHICK just chills out.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I love this place. As Lou pours himself
another, Adam starts to lose it again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Guys, we’re running out of ideas here!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I mean we tried the scientist, the tub – what
the fuck do we do next? Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in
his eye.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I know what we do next.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Rental car agency fucked us! There’s no flux
capacitor. Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver’s seat,
before walking around to the passenger side.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We’ll travel to 2010. Then one of us will come
back and get one of you. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Go light on the clutch. I don’t wanna lose our
deposit. Jacob starts the car.</p>
<p>****: This will not end well.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh shit, they found me! I don’t know how but
they found me!</p>
<p>****: I always wanted to say that. Punch it! Jacob HITS THE GAS.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Let’s see the look on this pig’s face when we
hit 88 and disappear into thin air! Yeah! The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80,
85, and then 90. And then 95. The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY.</p>
<p>****: This thing’s a piece of shit. Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES
DRASTICALLY.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hey Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>****: We’re doing a hundred. I can’t control this car.</p>
<p>****: I hear ya.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So do you think we should run away?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I wonder if we’ll still be here for our court
appearance.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If we’re still here in four months, I will
happily go to jail, because I’ll be fucked anyway. A GUY walks out of
the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He looks startled.</p>
<p><strong>towel guy</strong>: Who the hell are you dweebs?! Lou is up
IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD and PUMMELS HIM on the
floor! The others pull him off.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I have no tolerance for intruders.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is probably his room! We’re not
registered here in 87. Lou thinks for a moment and looks a “little”
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m still pretty OK with it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Just help me put him outside.</p>
<p>****: Hey. Dudes. Our friend’s… hellaciously wasted. He partied
pretty hearty… to the max. To the extreme max.</p>
<p><strong>dude #1</strong>: Bodacious.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So you guys wanna fuck with him or what?</p>
<p><strong>dude #2</strong>: Excellent. The dudes take custody of the
passed out TOWEL GUY and continue on down the hall, as our guys go back
inside.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s just go to sleep. We’ll figure
everything out in the morning. It’s pretty late. Jacob checks his watch,
rolling his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s 8:45. The other guys look at their
watches, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why am I so wiped out?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Because you’re old and lame?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah, fuck that, we’re going to that party!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We are not going to the party.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hear me out. Lou paces around the room like
Patton addressing the troops.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We saw the scientist. He was worthless. We
tried the tub. Dead end. I got us a fucking time machine. From Hertz. It
might as well have been a Nissan. Adam shakes his head, as Lou
continues.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Gentlemen, it’s fucking 1987. Nixon’s in the
White House, gas is free, and we’re about to put a man on the moon!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Did we go to the same school? Lou turns and
addresses Adam directly.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The point is you haven’t even met your wife
yet! She can’t fault you for shit that went down 23 years ago! Even if
23 years ago somehow ends up being tonight! Adam starts listening a
little more closely, as some of Lou’s logic actually makes “some”
sense.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It’s time to start facing the fact that we may
not be going home. And if that’s so, then we owe it to ourselves to make
the best life we can for ourselves. The guys listen intently, as Lou’s
speech reaches a passionate climax.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Because I don’t want to be that college
freshman who spends the first semester hiding in his dorm room, only to
realize that come spring, he has no friends.</p>
<p>****: No!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I want to be that college freshman who fucks
chicks way out of his league before they have an opportunity to realize
he’s not as cool as he’s pretending to be! Nick nods. Even Jacob
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Are you with me?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Close enough. We’ll talk some more at the
party.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This sweater makes me look like a jerkof f
.</p>
<p>****: It’s good to be home. In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK
TANK. Just as the shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A
small crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was this like an 80s thing?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: If he doesn’t lose that arm soon, I’m gonna
take it from him myself. With that, Lou wanders off toward another room,
leering at and groping girls as he goes.</p>
<p>****: He’s gonna be a problem. Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper
and douchey. They are excited to see Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Hey, glad you could make it!</p>
<p>****: This is your party?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Hey man, no hard feelings, all right? If your
bro says you’re cool, then we’re cool. Tad puts his arm around Jacob and
leads him into the party.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: There’s some people I want you to meet. By the
way, bodacious hair. Incredibly chic.</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah? It doesn’t really take that much product. It’s all in
the layering.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Whoa. Product. You’re blowing my mind right
now. Did you spend time in Europe?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Don’t tell me. Prague. Do you want some
coke?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Do you have Coke Zero?</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Ah, a conscientious objector. I like that.
Gotta stay sharp.</p>
<p><strong>in the kitchen</strong>: Nick mixes something in a large
bowl, as plenty of EAGER PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into
a tray of CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: These will be ready in 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>party chick</strong>: So it’s like jello. With vodka.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you enjoy a
delicious gelatin snack.</p>
<p><strong>party chick</strong>: How come no one ever thought of this
before?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t know. I just invented it. Party chick
looks into his eyes, dreamily.</p>
<p><strong>party chick</strong>: I appreciate you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>in the living room</strong>: Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD
for about 15-20 people. He’s performing Ace of Base’s “The Sign” and
SINGING PASSIONATELY. Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO
CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant
about how much he resents Ace of Base.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That band’s from the 90s.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I know. He made me borrow Tad’s video camera.
He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement
when we get back. Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the
room, making hot girls drink too much.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So, you like these guys?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: They’re rich, popular, and they shower me
with compliments. They’re pretty much the best friends I’ve ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>on a balcony</strong>: A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has
removed the cover of a</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Phil! Phil! Phil! Like a zen master, Phil
reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE, stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY.
Everyone celebrates!</p>
<p><strong>in the kitchen</strong>: Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG,
from which he drinks. He has his own CROWD rooting him on.</p>
<p><strong>nick’s crowd</strong>: Nick! Nick! Nick! He finishes the last
of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.</p>
<p><strong>party guy</strong>: This guy should be in charge of
everything!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I should.</p>
<p><strong>in the living room</strong>: Lou SITS ON A COUCH with
Michelle, one of the girls we met earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy
sits across from them next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Truth or dare? Lou confers with Michelle
before answering.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dare.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler up his ass.
Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You son of a bitch! Have you ever played this
game before? It’s supposed to be awesome! Lou nevertheless grabs a
TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and shoves it down the back of his pants.
His face contorts uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of
tears.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This is a horrible thing you’re doing and I
hope you never have to experience what I am currently going through. Lou
sits down and Michelle consoles him.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Your turn! Truth or dare? Before Sandy can
even confer with Jacob:</p>
<p>****: Truth. Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks
miserable, as Michelle confers with him.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t care. Whatever. This is not the point
of the game.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: OK, each of you has to tell your darkest,
most personal secret. Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh wow, all right. Let me think. I’ve never
told anyone this, but I was afraid of scary movies until I was 18. I
even ran out of the theater a couple of times.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh you poor thing! Come here… She takes
Jacob’s head to her chest and strokes it gently. Lou makes a jerk-off
gesture.</p>
<p>****: I’m not sure I should tell mine.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Come on! You have to!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: OK, but you can’t laugh.</p>
<p>****: We promise. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: So this one time me and my friend Lori took a
train to Baltimore. It was the summer and we wanted to party, but we had
no money. So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good
time and told him that we’d give him a half and half for seventy-five
dollars. You know – a suck and fuck. Lou and Jacob look shocked with the
MATTER OF FACT storytelling. Michelle smiles. She’s heard it before.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Anyway, we get him up to his room and Lori
starts going down on him, but I really wasn’t into it. So I broke a
piece of the bathroom mirror and used it to cut his artery on the-heck.
Right here… She rubs Jacob’s neck, pointing it out.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: He bled for about an hour before he died.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Afterwards, we took his wallet to the bar and
found out he only had forty-seven dollars. Michelle GIGGLES.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Michelle! You said you wouldn’t laugh!</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry! Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked.</p>
<p><strong>in another room</strong>: Adam sits in a chair in the corner,
secluded. To his LEFT – Nick’s in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his
mouth and earning accolades from all his new fans. To Adam’s RIGHT – The
truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU’S EAR. He screams
in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points
at Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Fuck you, your turn.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s the gay ear, you know. As Adam looks
STRAIGHT AHEAD – He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts’
CASSETTE TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then he
reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before getting up and
WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So I lied to you earlier. I wasn’t here for a
power tool convention. Jennie instinctively looks around for her
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I know. You don’t look like you could handle
power tools.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The truth is, Jennie, I’ve always liked you.
But I’ve never really known you. I really wasn’t supposed to meet you
again.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he
might as well tell her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I came here from the future. She rolls her
eyes - she’s heard all the one-liners.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your
spaceship built for two? Or maybe you’re wondering if these are
astronaut pants?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Astronaut pants?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Because my ass is out of this world? Give me
a break, spaz. I’ve heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after
her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just
regular time travel. With normal pants.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: OK, what’s the punch line? An ARM comes from
behind and CHOKES ADAM. It’s Blaine.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I thought I told you to stay off my
mountain, partner!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Blaine, stop!</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You talking to my girl? Huh? I can’t hear
you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Blaine, that’s enough! Let him go! He can’t
breathe! Blaine doesn’t stop. He smiles like an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Can’t breathe? Is that right? Can you
breathe, partner? What’s that? I can’t hear you. Just tell me you can’t
breathe and I’ll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: He’s not saying anything. I guess he can
breathe. Jennie pulls on Blaine’s arm, trying to free Adam.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Babe, stop. Jennie, stop! Blaine turns and
accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She goes down. He releases Adam
and turns to help her.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Baby, I’m sorry. See what you made me
do?!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs
Adam’s arm and YANKS HIM along with her, as she storms away.</p>
<p>****: Come on, let’s go! Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie
leave with Adam.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Sandy, I don’t know what you did with this
wine, but it is delightful.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s from a box. There’s lots!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mmm. Fantastic.</p>
<p>****: Do you mind if I borrow my friend? We’ll only be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re gonna fuck her!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not gonna have sex with her. She killed a
guy!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was
about the money.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Great, so she’s a prostitute. I’m not
sleeping with a hooker either.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: She’s not a hooker. She’s a girl who did what
she had to do to make a few bucks. Listen, she’s probably awesome in
bed.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She probably has a hairy vagina.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Exactly! Jacob looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not having this conversation. It’s
pointless. I don’t have a condom.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Perfect! Me neither! No one here uses condoms.
It’s like heaven. Only with a lot more coke. Lou takes his COKE out of
his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Like a fucking madman? He slaps Jacob’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Rock and roll. Lou exits the bathroom and calls
out to the girls.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who’s ready to get laid by an awesome
penis?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That’s gonna cost
you.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll tell ya what… Adam moves her token up a
few squares and makes a show of looking over his shoulder, as if someone
might see.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not supposed to do this. But I’m gonna
upgrade you to Marvin Gardens. It’s a suite. Plus, there’s an excellent
buffet and a view of the pool. Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks
around, as if someone might see her. Adam notices.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No one’s gonna see you hanging out with the
creepy spaz. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m sorry I called you those names.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, it’s cool. I was being creepy and
spazzy.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: You’re still not gonna tell me how you know
me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m from the future.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Fine, let’s just drop it. I’m glad you’re
feeling better. Blaine had no right to hit you.</p>
<p>****: I bet he’s going out of his mind right now.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What are you doing with a douche like him
anyway? You’re so much better than that.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yeah, well guys like you come to visit. Guys
like him live here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So if I lived here, I’d have a shot? For a
moment, Jennie is thrown off. She’s about to say something, but checks
herself. Instead she nervously stands.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m gonna get going. Adam stands up with
her.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Thanks for being a good guy. I don’t
remember the last time I had this much fun playing such a stupid game.
She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: If you run into Blaine, you can tell him I
blew you. But that’s all. We didn’t do anything else.</p>
<p>****: We didn’t do anything!</p>
<p>****: Shh. It’s our little secret. Jennie exits, leaving Adam
confused.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Tab?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that
this looks like very good sex – it is very bad sex for Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jennie!</p>
<p>****: What are you doing here?! Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS.
He’s freaked out.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I thought about what you said and you’re
right. I should be with you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t necessarily say that.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I want you, Adam! She RIPS OPEN her
lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh my god! She kisses him again and they start
to go at it. Just then –</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What the hell is going on here? Adam pushes
Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room. Lily is standing in the
doorway, looking sad and angry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lily?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So you do like her better than me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, she just– Adam looks to where Jennie just
was, but now the bed is covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There’s also a
LARGE BOX OF TISSUES and some HAND LOTION.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p>****: Jennie?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What’s wrong with my vagina, Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nothing’s wrong with it. It’s beautiful. In
the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a beautiful vagina. Among the prettiest
I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Stay out of it, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Would it be so bad to spend the rest of your
life with my vagina?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. It wouldn’t at all. Lily turns and walks
out the door.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lily, it wouldn’t! I love your vagina! I love
your vaginaaaaaa!</p>
<p>****: Vagina… huh? He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of
the room. He’s ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I just really need to get a few things off my
chest. You’re domineering and you think you have all the answers, but
you don’t. Not by a long shot. Nick is getting emotional.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think you’re better than me? Last night I
made jello shots and everybody loved me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They didn’t care that I only brought home 60k
last year. They loved me for me. They didn’t go throwing their rich
parents’ weight around. I don’t know, Courtney.</p>
<p><strong>6-year-old courtney</strong>: It’s OK. Nick CRIES a little
bit harder.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s so good to hear your voice. I love you,
princess. I really do. You just make it so hard on me sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>6-year-old courtney</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re right. It’s OK. I just want it to be
OK. Adam starts registering some of this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Who are you talking to? Nick looks at Adam and
covers the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Courtney.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you mean “Courtney?” Adam picks up
ANOTHER PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>6-year-old courtney</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Get off the phone!! But Nick is down the
rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Baby, I gotta go. Just think about what I
said. We’re so great together. It’s like when we’re having sex - the way
our bodies become one, as we both embrace the passion of the moment– On
the other end, COURTNEY’S DAD has picked up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>who the fuck is this?!</strong>: Nick hangs up the phone and
stares at it, freaked out. Adam just shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK, so that may have been bad.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What were you thinking? The DOOR OPENS and Lou
strolls in, looking quite fresh.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry? This guy!
He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him – The Towel
Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP.</p>
<p><strong>towel guy</strong>: Hey, get the hell out of my room! In one
move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door with his foot,
and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then converts it into a SLEEPER
HOLD, putting the guy to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, we’re going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Help me put him in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Has anyone seen Jacob?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: He’s grabbing drinks with Tad and Chaz. Which
is what we should do. We’ll start at the Brew Haus and do a three drink
crawl up the street– Adam gets more fed up than ever.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Guys! I refuse to accept that we’re stuck in
1987! Maybe you’re loving it, Lou. But you don’t get it. Nick’s insane,
Jacob’s become a bigger douche than before, and I need to get back for
my goddamn rehearsal dinner? Which is tomorrow!</p>
<p>****: Adam. I know I don’t look like I understand, but I do. You have
a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world.
And if you could, you’d literally travel across time for her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I get it, man. Life is about these moments.
Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep
and find the motivation… the courage… the guts to do what’s right and
what’s necessary. It’s moments like these… Lou suddenly notices some
COCAINE on the edge of the tub.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Jesus, how come nobody told me there was coke
out here? Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What was I saying? Adam and Nick get out and
towel off. Lou follows.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe we have to learn something?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know, like Groundhog Day. We have to learn
the meaning of life or some shit. Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE
on the base of the tub JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT
LIGHT! For a moment, everyone is quiet.</p>
<p>****: I’ve gotta stop doing cocaine and I need to go to the hospital.
I just saw a fucking kitten explode.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I saw it too. The guys run over to the tub.
The bubbles are on low, but there’s NOTHING IN IT.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It didn’t explode. It vanished. It went back…
to the present.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This is the present.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Our old present.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So it is the tub! Lou POINTS at something.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Um… The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it’s
clearly running.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK. You guys know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Maybe these aren’t the right kittens? Adam
points at him in a “now you’re thinking” way.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’ll split up. Get as many different cats as
you can. Let’s all meet back here in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You can count on me!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by
3 in overtime.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Eat shit and die, scumbag. I’ve got ten large
on this game.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Not only that, but I bet you Elway’s gonna
throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Fat chance, pal. Elway’s done nothing all
day.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Care to make it interesting?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Who the hell are you? Lou thinks about the
question for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Name’s Musselman. Hank Musselman. I’ve got a
cool name, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s a good name. What did you have in mind,
Musselman?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I win – your wife gives me a blowjob. A classy
one. For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a bad
job of feigning disinterest.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: All right, buddy, fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You win – you can kill me. Any way you want.
Knife, gun, torch, sword… I’ll even make a video exonerating you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, right…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m serious. You look like a man who has
everything. Except the license to kill. Care to gamble? Rick looks at
Lou long and hard. Lou doesn’t flinch.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: 37 seconds?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You have a deal. As Rick and Lou shake hands,
Candace makes a show of looking offended.</p>
<p>****: Don’t worry, babe. This yahoo’s made a wager he can’t possibly
win. Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in his
mouth and shows it to Rick.</p>
<p>****: Look. Who am I? I’m your wife. Nuts in my mouth. Get it?</p>
<p>****: I like it slow and romantic.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, sorry man.</p>
<p>****: Hey! How’s that iPod working out for you?</p>
<p><strong>japanese businessman</strong>: Oh, it’s a very nice toy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If you like that, I’ve got a phone back at the
lodge that will knock your socks off.</p>
<p><strong>japanese businessman</strong>: I wish I could see it. But I
am on my way to a very important business meeting.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh yeah? More important than Bluetooth?</p>
<p><strong>japanese businessman</strong>: My associates and I are co-
financing a… how do you say it… supermarket business.</p>
<p>****: You’re not going to Boston, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>japanese businessman</strong>: Yes! Boston! We leave
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re gonna franchise out the Gelman’s Mom
and Pop!</p>
<p><strong>japanese businessman</strong>: Yes! How do you know this?
Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Walk with me a minute. Let me tell you about
some companies you should really be looking into…</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad and I think
you’re the cat’s pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD
DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad and Chaz. He drops
off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY .</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish
name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as
Geoffrey shakes his hand.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Jacob, would you like some too? He offers
a pill bottle.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Rohypnol. Geoffrey’s father is a pharmacist,
but we don’t hold that against him.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Rohypnol?</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: You slip it to a chick who won’t go to third.
Give it an hour and you’ll be rounding home.</p>
<p>****: This is a date rape drug.</p>
<p>****: What the fuck is date rape?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: These are roofies!</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Roofies… I like that!</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Yeah, it takes the clinical name right out of
it. It sounds so fresh, chicks might even take it voluntarily!</p>
<p>****: Hey, can we use that? Jacob looks beside himself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I got regular cats. I figured maybe the kitten
was a fluke. Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come here. He leads Adam near the tub, where
Lou points at something.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What am I looking at? It’s some kind of
stain.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Smell it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not smelling it.</p>
<p>****: Smell the stain. Adam puts his nose up against the stain and
SNIFFS. He recognizes something, but can’t put his finger on it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Red Bull.</p>
<p><strong>guy in tub</strong>: Hey, you fellas mind? I’m trying to get
a handjob here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So you’re telling me that Red Bull plus hot
tub equals time travel?</p>
<p>****: Mmm hmm. Hank Musselman’s getting the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There was just enough Red Bull for the kitten.
Not nearly enough for a human. It’s a weight distribution thing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How did you even figure this out?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Scientific method.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn’t lick the
stain.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I thought it was some guy’s jizz.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It worked, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, except one little problem. There’s no
Red Bull in 1987. For a moment, they’re all bummed again. Then Adam gets
an encouraged look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes there is! Come on! Adam heads for the
door, as Lou and Nick follow.</p>
<p>****: You can’t be here. If Blaine sees you, he’ll snap your neck. I
told him I blew you and he’s not happy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why would you do that?! Behind Adam, Nick
looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes almost BUG OUT. He elbows
Lou.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look. Lou looks to where Nick is looking:
YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids for Jennie to
return to their lesson.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Holy shit! Lou immediately approaches the kids,
even as Nick tries to hold him back.</p>
<p>****: where the fuck are you going?! Lou walks right up to his
YOUNGER SELF and looks himself square in the face.</p>
<p><strong>young lou</strong>: What the hell do you want, old man? Lou
PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and Young Adam are
freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn’t notice, as he’s arguing
with Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>young lou</strong>: What the fuck, dude?! I think you broke
my nose! My parents are gonna sue the shit out of you!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Herschel and Evelyn aren’t gonna do a damn
thing. They’re losers.</p>
<p><strong>young lou</strong>: How do you know my parents?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Listen to me. Start putting minoxidil on your
scalp. Tonight. Then, when Propecia comes on the market, start taking
it. Every day. Hair is important.</p>
<p><strong>young lou</strong>: I don’t give a shit about hair.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You will! Or I’ll tell everyone about how you
jerked off to that issue of Playgirl.</p>
<p>****: It was confusing! There were naked people and it had “girl” in
the title!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hey, you don’t have to justify to me, pal.</p>
<p>****: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m God.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It’s your
funeral. He’s in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Moment of truth. Lou takes off his hat and
feels his scalp - no hair.</p>
<p>****: That fucker! Just then, Lou’s NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result
of being broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of the
movie. Lou touches his nose.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh, that’s just great. Jacob runs up, in a
friendlier disposition.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hey guys!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I thought you were with douche patrol.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are
date rapists.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of
determination again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: To get my bag. We get that, we have the Red
Bull, and our ticket home.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes! The race is on!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What race?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Duh, it’s 1987? We’re at a ski resort?</p>
<p>****: Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race.
Usually at dawn. It’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Welcome to my lair.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You live here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, this is kind of a shitty place to
live.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I don’t live here. Adam approaches Blaine,
trying to speak maturely.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look. Blaine. I think we got off on the wrong
foot. You have some issue with me.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You get blown by my girl? I’ll say that’s
one hell of an issue.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Whoa! You got blown?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She didn’t blow me. She lied to you to make
you jealous. I’m not trying to steal Jennie. I just wanna get my
bag.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Oh, your bag. I was wondering when you’d
come around for that. Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, I’ll just take it and get out of your
way.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You will? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whattya say? Can we work this out like
gentlemen? Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What is this town’s obsession with knives?</p>
<p>****: How about I work this out like… a butcher? Just then, LIGHT
SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a polo shirt stands in a
dooorway.</p>
<p><strong>guy in polo shirt</strong>: Hey! Scumbuckets! Back to work!
Like naughty children being caught red handed, Blaine and his goons lose
the knives and hustle toward the open door. Blaine grabs the backpack
from Tad. Adam and the guys follow through the door and into –</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You guys are posers! You’re not better than
me!</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Jacob, I wish you hadn’t seen us like this.
Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN.</p>
<p>****: These would look so good with your light complexion.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Listen asshole! I want my bag!</p>
<p>****: Will you excuse me for a moment? Blaine walks behind the
COUNTER and SHOVES THE BAG in a SAFE.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Safe’s on a timer. It’ll open tomorrow. We
race at dawn. Winner gets the bag. Loser leaves town. Lou turns to
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: See? I told you!</p>
<p>****: I don’t wanna race you.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Then I guess you don’t want your bag.</p>
<p>****: See you at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a mean dick.
Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That chick blew you?!</p>
<p>****: I’ve got a race to win. Europe’s “The Final Countdown” begins
playing over a MONTAGE: – Skis are sharpened.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Just stick to the plan and you’re gonna be
fine. Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jacob, I’m sorry for not always being the big
brother I should’ve been. I was away at college, Mom gave you my Sega -
there were a whole host of issues. Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to
Adam too.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I know. I’m sorry too. I put a few things
before my family and took my guilt out on you. I guess it was an
inevitable I’d end up part of a roofie ring. Adam smiles and extends his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Friends? Jacob takes Adam’s hand and helps him
to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Brothers. They EMBRACE. Lou looks
disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Gay. Blaine and his goons approach from below.
Adam puts on his game face.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t think you guys would show.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: This was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s gonna make my victory taste all the more
sweeter. Like a Peach Snapple.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’ll see. Blaine actually looks rattled, as
the two men get lined up. Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re not afraid of getting beat by a guy on
a skateboard, are you?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I’ve seen you in action. You’re reckless and
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Reckless and terrible’s my middle name.
Because I feel the need… for speed! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting
line.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Catch ya at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>3, 2, 1… go!</strong>: Blaine takes off down the mountain
like a professional skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward
Jacob, who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up speed,
starting at about one mile per hour. Blaine looks back and can’t believe
how easily he’s gonna coast to victory.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Here goes nothing. Instead of weaving back and
forth, Adam just stays in the crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly
PASSES BLAINE, despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course. He
BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING! Blaine finds the guts
to alter his STYLE, skiing more recklessly too. He begins catching up to
Adam. Blaine skis up next to Adam - they’re both going full force.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You can’t beat me! I was born on this
mountain!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was born in a hospital like a normal baby!
Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY MISSING trees and
rocks. Blaine tries to keep up. Adam has the finish line in his sights,
when he rolls the dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a
rock and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.</p>
<p><strong>hot chick kisses him.</strong>: Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO
FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL’S ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ahhhh! My arm!!!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You did it, man.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ah, it was nothing. I just fell down the
mountain.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was a beautiful fall. Lou goes into Adam’s
backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH, which he begins unwrapping.</p>
<p>****: Tell me you are not going to keep eating that. Lou takes a bite
and SHRUGS.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Chicken parm. It’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Chicken parm? Adam takes the sandwich from
Lou. He looks at it closely.</p>
<p>****: Chicken parm. On this roll. The guys look confused, as Adam
stares at the sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Adam, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It was our first date. You know those nights
that are just perfect? This wasn’t one of those nights.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If Lily knew where we were, I’m sure she
would’ve walked home. And I wouldn’t have blamed her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We were so hungry by the time we found that
deli, we would’ve eaten anything. So what if it wasn’t foie gras and
pino noir. It was chicken parm and Italian soda. And it couldn’t have
been more perfect.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That sandwich was special, huh?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You could say that. You could also say it gave
me horrible diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lily had every opportunity to leave. She
didn’t know me at all and she certainly didn’t owe me anything after the
night I put her through. But she stayed.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She saw me at my worst and she stayed. Lily
holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t you see? This is more than a sandwich.
It represents all that shit. All that puke.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Keep the sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This is disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She gave me this as a reminder of her
love.</p>
<p>****: Or to give me horrible diarrhea so I didn’t leave the room
during the bachelor party. But mostly as a reminder of her love. Adam
holds up the sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is the reason I need to go home. Adam
stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m gonna go prep the tub. Lou holds up a BAG
OF CHIPS.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Do you have any stories about these chips or
can I eat them?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: There you are!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jennie! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Making good on a rumor. Jennie STANDS UP in
the tub and she’s TOPLESS. Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: When I saw you win that race against Blaine,
everything changed for me. I realize now that I deserve more. I deserve
a winner.</p>
<p>****: Come and get your prize. Adam reaches next to the tub and hands
her a ROBE.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, I… can’t. She covers up,
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Oh my god. I missed my opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, I’m not sure there ever was an
opportunity. Jennie, you’re terrific. You’ve brought me so many moments
of joy, you’ll never know. But I shouldn’t have given you the wrong
idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The truth is there’s a girl I need to go see.
We have plans to spend the rest of our lives together. And I can’t wait
any longer. And I’m totally cool with it. Adam smiles, feeling the rush
of knowing he’s ready. But then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves
closer to her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: One day, you’re going to find the right guy
who’s willing to give up everything and travel across time and space for
your love. She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.</p>
<p>****: I would totally blow you right now.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know you would.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We don’t have to go yet, Adam. Things are just
getting fun.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: And we can do whatever we want without any
real consequences. That’s a lot to give up.</p>
<p>****: That’s how I know I’m doing the right thing. Adam reaches in
his backpack, but can’t find the Red Bull. He turns it inside out and
shakes it – nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where’s the Red Bull?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You looking for this? Across the patio, a
drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: You couldn’t leave well enough alone, could
ya? You couldn’t just win the race and call it a day? You had to have
Jennie too.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t want Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: That’s funny. I don’t want this soda,
either. Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam’s face goes desperate, as
Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p>****: Why? Lou takes Blaine’s pulse.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Holy shit! You may have killed this guy! No
wait… wait… I’ve got a pulse. Eh, so much for that. Nick puts his hand
on Adam’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sorry man. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The Red Bull’s gone. He fucked us.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not necessarily. Everyone looks toward
Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The Red Bull isn’t really gone. It’s in him.
A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Come on, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Nah, I’ll take a rain check.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Listen, your lives at home sound all beautiful
and happy with your barbecues and swimming pools and “oh, that sandwich
reminds of some gay shit I did one time.” Adam and Nick don’t look
thrilled to be reduced to this.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: But my life back there sucks. And in case you
haven’t noticed, my life here fucking rules. So I have a coke problem?
I’ll go to rehab. I have no money? I’ll stop winning sex and start
winning dollars. Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987. And you’ll
excuse me, but I value banging young chicks way more than all of your
friendships combined.</p>
<p>****: No offense. Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, no, I get it. Lou goes around and gives
them all hugs.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Makes perfect sense, man. Lou squeezes Jacob’s
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t hate you as much as I used to.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS
BLAINE’S LIMP BODY.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK, whenever you’re ready, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: One small step for man! One giant asshole
puking in a hot tub! Here goes nothing! Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER
on Blaine. It takes ONE… TWO… THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE
TUB! For a second, it’s just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: OK, well maybe if we– A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES
THE SCREEN! And when it dies down, we see Adam, Nick, Jacob in the hot
tub where we left them. Only Lou is missing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What happened? Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I didn’t feel anything.</p>
<p>****: Guys, look. They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL
FLARED-OUT SKI ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds
ago.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Dammit. Even the deck furniture’s the same. We
fucking blew it. It didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where’s Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Right on schedule! Lou walks toward them, but
there’s a lot that’s “off” about him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and
a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC SURGERY that makes him look at once older and
younger.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you’d
react.</p>
<p>****: Didn’t think you’d be scared.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re damn right it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You just traveled 23 years in three seconds.
Took me 23 years. It’s good to see you guys!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: We’re back? It all looks the same.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It better! You know how much I pay the
groundspeople around here? A lot. But that’s all right, I’m fucking
loaded. Look at all this. Everyone looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Will you fill in some of the blanks for me,
please?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’ll give you the short version, because time
is of the essence. First of all, to settle an old bet, time most
definitely has been moving forward. It is exactly three days since
you’ve arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst. Jacob looks at Nick.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Told you.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Secondly, I’m filthy rich. Made sports bets.
Sued Ace of Base. I own most of V ermont.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’ve been reimagining the state as my own
personal playground. You could say I’m a little bit like Michael
Jackson, except I don’t fuck kids. Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at
Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I do fuck them, though. Haven’t gone above 24
years old in 10 years and even then, it was a mistake.</p>
<p>****: A horrible mistake.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2 hours to get
to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner.</p>
<p>****: Great, I blew it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Not even a little bit. I have a helicopter
waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes
away. The guys look stunned.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I had some time to plan. God, it’s good to have
you guys back!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: By the way, Adam, I hope you don’t mind. Right
after you left, I fucked Jennie silly.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why would she have sex with you?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You get the big time assist. All that talk of
her finding the right guy who’s willing to give up everything? Made her
wetter than a log flume.</p>
<p>****: She’s all-time top five.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good to hear.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Lou, I gotta ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Time travel paradox.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Exactly. Aren’t there now two of you living
here in 2010?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Think really hard about that one. What happened
to me when I was 19? Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their
eyes nearly pop out of their skulls.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No way…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You went missing and were never found.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah, you’re gonna have some lingering memories
of both versions.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait a minute, what happened to… you know.
Other Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Lou…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The kid sucked, OK? He couldn’t take even a
little bit of direction. Pretty soon I realized that having two versions
of the same dude walking around – as cool as that sounds – didn’t make
very much sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: So I took care of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I had to do it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I killed myself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah, it was really some existential shit. I
mean, here I am committing homicide and I’m actually committing
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How could you?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It was easy actually. For a minute, I thought I
might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing. You know, the same
matter can’t occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both
go poof? Especially after that whole nose thing. But no, it was just a
murder. I didn’t suffer.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t wanna hear any more.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It was strangulation.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t wanna hear any more! They sit in
horrified silence for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’ll have to introduce me when we get there.
Your families won’t know me. Although I’m sure they’re huge fans.</p>
<p>****: So hey, getting married, huh? Taking the plunge! Adam looks
disturbed. Nick looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This makes no sense at all.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Don’t you ever let me take your phone
again!</p>
<p>****: I’m here on time. Just like I promised. Nick sits down next to
COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m so happy to see you and I can’t wait to
spend the rest of my life with you.</p>
<p>****: Me too!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re the one. Lily notices Adam’s on
CRUTCHES.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh my god, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: My fault entirely, madam! The room is ABUZZ
with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE
TUXEDO.</p>
<p><strong>guy at table</strong>: Hey, it’s Lou Blustein! The whole room
APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the guys can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I
mistakenly wandered into your fiance’s path. His broken leg is my broken
heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses
Lily’s hand. She looks genuinely flattered. Lou gets up and whispers to
Adam.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: See? I’m awesome here. You shoulda stayed out
of that tub.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was thinking we’d invite Adam and Lily over
for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That’s… if it’s OK
with you?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Why wouldn’t it be OK with me? That sounds
nice.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: You look so good in this shirt, by the
way. Nice choice. She puts her head on Nick’s shoulder as they
dance.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So… how are your parents?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Still working hard. I really wish they
could retire already, but it’s tough competing with the big chains. I
mean, they just have the one store…</p>
<p>****: Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork! We have to get back to Tokyo. I
have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal. Nick
stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY.</p>
<p>****: You know what they say about hard work. Builds character.</p>
<p><strong>by the bar</strong>: Adam orders drinks, as his PHONE RINGS.
He picks it up and in an instant, JACOB IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM as
a VERY</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ahh!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This is why we shouldn’t have sold that iPod.
Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The Japanese have apparently cornered the
technology sector over the past 20 years. We’ve dealt American
businesses quite an irreparable blow.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What does that mean for us?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Pretty much nothing for us personally. We
just get cooler phones and iPods and shit.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh. Great! Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as
Lily approaches. Adam can’t help but beam from ear to ear.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I know you were only gone for a couple days,
but I missed you so much. Adam takes her hand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here. We have
unfinished business. Lily smiles. She gets into it.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s about time. OK, what’s the fantasy?</p>
<p>****: How about you’re the woman I love and I’m the man of your
dreams?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Booor-ing!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: OK, you’re a nurse and a snake bit my
penis.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Done and done. They bolt for the door and
we</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: So you’re friends with the bride?</p>
<p><strong>beautiful girl</strong>: Can you keep a secret? I’m actually
kinda crashing the party.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Naughty girl. You’re secret’s safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful girl</strong>: I’m just in town for a couple of
nights. I’m actually looking for my father. We’ve never met.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m from here. Maybe I know him.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful girl</strong>: His name is Hank Musselman. For a
moment, Lou’s expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then –</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No, never heard of him. He goes back to MAKING
OUT WITH HER and we:</p>
