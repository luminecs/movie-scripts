<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ladies, please, we’re doing everything we can
to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety
of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our
wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Have you seen Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I haven’t seen him all morning.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ramon, have you seen Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: No, senor.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Where is Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Fuck off, Ronnie, it’s just a parking
lot.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Yeah, skating’s not a crime, dick.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Skateboarding is not allowed on mall
premises. Pull over now!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: We’re not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah, fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I was driving in reverse and trying to get
you to flip into the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That way I could handcuff you smoothly and
take you in. You know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf
cart.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It seems like we go through this every day.
What’s it going to take for you all to realize that I won’t tolerate
this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don’t worry about
the rules attitude?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Ronnie, I hear what you’re saying and I just
want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up
and I just want you to know that I’m really sorry because you can’t do
shit and you can take your little rules and stick’em up your ass, you
fuckin’ rent-a-cop.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Yeah, suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s funny, guys. I try to be a mentor to
the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to
the land of street- hardened criminals. I’m left with no choice. You
call me rent-a- cop, but I call myself the law’s right hand. I see the
crime… and I phone it in. And that’s what I’m getting ready to do right
now.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: 317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over at
Carolina Mall. Come in, over.</p>
<p><strong>walkie voice</strong>: This is Officer Douglas, what do you
wish to report? Over.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ve got a couple of trespassers who have
been found skateboarding on mall property. Can you send a black and
white over to take these boys into processing? Over.</p>
<p><strong>walkie voice</strong>: Uh… Yeah, Ronnie, we’re kind of busy
today. I mean, we got like three car accidents.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What do you mean? I’ve got these guys
red-handed. I’m gonna need a car over here pronto. I can’t hold them all
day by myself. Over.</p>
<p><strong>walkie voice</strong>: Copy. Yeah, like I said, we’re awfully
busy right now. I think you should probably just make’em promise not to
do it again and threaten to call their parents or something. That’ll get
them. Over.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sir, I don’t think you understand, their
parents don’t care about them. This is a 911 from one of your soldiers.
Officer needs assistance! Over!</p>
<p><strong>walkie voice</strong>: Yeah, it’s not gonna happen…</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So as you can see, the law is just one
little call away. But I’m gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I’m
gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that’s
called handle shit myself.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: While I won’t have you arrested today, I am
going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don’t
know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you
step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point,
I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You accepted it originally, so it still
counts.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and
purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works
in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of
the mall.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: And please turn your wrath on any sinners that
try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of
hell. In Christ’s name we pray, amen.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: So what’s on the agenda for you today?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You know, the usual. Spot crime before it
happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death,
yada yada yada.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: What’s wrong, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nothing, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie, I know that you really want to be a
Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way
they’re meant to.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I know. I’m okay, Nell. Thanks, but really,
I mean, I’m on the front lines right now. I’m livin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Your job is definitely more exciting than
mine.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Of course it is, but at least you don’t have
to wrestle with the demons at night. I better get going.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’ll see you after work, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up
appearances, we talked about this. And don’t call me sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’m sorry. I’ll see you after work, Officer
Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: ’Bye, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This
ain’t a race. Hey, second time, slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’ve been looking all over for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I haven’t been hiding, but some things that
I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and ‘official’ eyes.
Trust me, it’s best all around if there are no bodies to clean up.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: So you may or may not have heard, but this
morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a
crazy Pervert.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: For the love of God.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I know, it’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You want me to phone this one in to the
police?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Not just yet. See if we call the police,
they’ll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little
traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for
this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in
so we can handle this discreetly.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand
you. You’re telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and
Reporting crime and at the same time, you’re giving me authorization to
handle this case on my own.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m just saying keep an eye out and keep
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So basically, I’m in charge of this whole
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: There’s no investigation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Not yet. Okay, Mark, I’ll do it, but I’m
gonna need a few things first.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You can’t carry a gun.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I’m gonna need a new title. Something
to instill fear in the criminal mind. How about Director of Mall
Intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Head of Mall Security.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: And it doesn’t come with a raise.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: And the new title stays between us.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Understood. Thank you for this opportunity,
Mark. I won’t let you down.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Excuse me, sir, but we would like
to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m sorry, but I can’t answer anything.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: We heard a report that an
unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several
women. Do you care to comment?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m not allowed to comment on that
situation.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: So you admit there is a
situation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m trained to resist torture for up to 72
hours, you really expect me to break now? Get real, lady.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: We’re wasting our time here. Let’s
go find some police to interview.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It just means you won’t find any police.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Are you telling me the police
haven’t even been called!</p>
<p>****: Ewww, alert the media.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Jesus, well who’d they leave in
charge, you?</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Yeah, right. Why would they leave
you in charge?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: First of all, if there was a situation to be
handled, I don’t see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would
be in charge.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Look, there is no way you’re in
charge of this investigation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well for your information, I’m in charge of
this whole fucking operation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t give a goddamn if you believe me or
not, Ms. Hot Fuckin’ SHIT news lady. I’m the first line of defense
against this pervert. As the law’s right hand, I’m here so that people
like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like
this mall are safe and fun. I’m the defender of this war zone. Just me
and my goddamn flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: You motherfucker, you put a boot on my
car!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I warned you about parking in the fire lane,
Saddamn!</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that goddamn boot
off of my car.</p>
<p>****: Step away now!</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: I pay good money to this mall. Don’t tell
me where to park!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sir, I will be forced to take action if you
do not step back!</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: I’m gonna kill you!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: As I was saying, the pervert situation here
is real bleak. For all you people out there thinking of coming to the
mall, please for your own safety, stay away.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: I can’t believe you tased me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s right and I’ve got another one
waiting right here for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, Brandi.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That color looks great on your skin. Not
just that color, but I’ve noticed that all make-up looks really good on
you. Especially the blue around your eyes. I bet it drives the men
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s okay. I can say that because I’m
taken.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What do you want, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m here on official business. See, I don’t
know if you know this, but I have recently been made Head of Mall
Security. Did you hear about that?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I’m sure you will. It’s actually
pretty huge news. But the reason I stopped by is to tell you that it
looks like we’ve got a pervert on the loose. A real live psychopath who
gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as
yourself. I just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to
work.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Okay, got it.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: And you may not want to wear any of those
skirts that you like to wear.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What skirts?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You know what skirts. Something like that
could set him off. And for that matter, you better not wear any of those
little low-cut top things either, okay? Especially with those black bras
because, you can really see them in the light. Perverts really tend to
notice stuff like that. Okay, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Dennis, man, I’m glad we’ve got a minute to
talk. There’s no easy way to say this so I’m just going to come right
out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I
know this isn’t easy for you to hear seeing as you’ve been here longer
than me. But I want you to know that you’re my best friend and I’m only
going to accept the job if you’re okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, you should know I’ve already accepted
and it’s too late to turn it down now. Every ship needs a captain. So
you were passed over. Who gives a shit? Dennis, in time, you’ll come to
accept answering to me. Remember, there aren’t any leaders in
friendship. We cool?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or
something?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, you’re right. You’re probably in no
mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See
you later, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You think you’re ready for a shot at the title,
motherfucker?!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m ready, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ding ding.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What’s wrong, baby? Is your pussy hurting?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You give?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You move with me, you go down. You move
against me and your arm breaks.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I give!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I give! Let me go, goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I can’t believe you got that lucky shit on
me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Luck has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You almost broke my arm.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m sorry, Mom. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p>****: This plays as realistic as possible, no phony punches or
smooth/comedy fighting, it looks like a school</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, well for your information, I’m in
charge of this whole BEEP operation. I don’t give a BEEP if you believe
me or not, Ms. Hot BEEP BEEP news lady. Do you see anybody else? BEEP no
you don’t. As the law’s right hand, I’m the first line of defense
against this pervert. I’m here so that people like you can live in your
own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun.
I’m the defender of this war zone. Just me and my BEEP flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: No comment as to why steps are not
being taken, but this Security Guard feels like he is the only one doing
anything to protect the people who visit Carolina Mall from the suspect.
For all of us, I hope this isn’t the case. Back to you, Lindsay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m so proud of you, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Do you think I did good?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hell yes. You were great.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ah, you’re just drunk.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Nah, you did good.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I usually don’t come out to the
forefront like that.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: My official orders are Observe and Report,
but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me
changed. It’s what I’ve always wanted. Things haven’t always worked out,
with the whole… well, you know. But this gives me faith that I can do
something great. This is my call to duty and I’m going to answer. I’m
going to bust this fucking pervert. I swear it on everything I am.
Anyway, I better get to sleep. I got a big day tomorrow. Good night,
Mom. Mom?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You working the door here?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: That’s what they tell me. They needed to
hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or
whatever.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Kind of funny they thought they needed more
security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you
need to call me to handle the situation.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I work for O’Charley’s, not for the
mall.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Granted, but you realize that my
jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under
the roof of Carolina Mall?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You know, I thought about getting a job as
a Mall Security.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Yeah, man. I mean, I’m kind of on extended
vacation from college and it’s just like, I don’t want to do shit, you
know what I mean? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at
home, but I just don’t feel like doing anything. This was the easiest
job I could find, I mean, what the hell could be hard about being a
bouncer in a mall restaurant? But now that I think about it, Mall
Security could be easier than this.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do
you know how much stuff I’m in charge of?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: A shitload. That’s not even counting the
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Really? I thought you just kind of chilled
out and called stuff into the police.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No way, that’s about like 75, maybe 82
percent of it. There’s so much other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Two words, Friday Night.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s crazy, let’s just leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Listen. I like you, but I don’t like the
fact that you’re masquerading as an official in the security world. If
you’re serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps I
could look into getting you a job on my staff?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Part of my job is reaching out to troubled
youths such as yourself. It’s who I am.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Does it pay more than $6.50 an hour?</p>
<p>****: Seven even.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I’d say that’s more than I’m making
now.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hold on, this job involves a probationary
period. You have to prove yourself worthy. We can’t just hire any old
Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You have to complete a term as deputy. You
will answer directly to me. Your job will be to come and find me if you
see any trouble. If this works out, then I will phone the crime into the
police. Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal
activity. Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an
official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of
actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: So basically, I just do what I’m doing now
and then you’ll get me a job?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: For starters.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: How long does this mentorship last?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Until Mark lets me hire another guy.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Can I smoke while I work?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Sign me up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You keep that attitude up and you’ll have no
problem making the squad.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s a flashlight. Get to know it. It’s your
new best friend. Until you get your giant flashlight. Then, that will be
your new best friend.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy time
starts now. No more slacker attitude for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You know, I remember when I got my first
flashlight…</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Alright, people, she’s doing good. We’re just
gonna get her down to my office and everything’s going to be fine, so
the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your
stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school
savings here at Carolina Mall.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: It was horrible! Oh, my God, the thought of
that disgusting – I think I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just let it out, baby. He should be
ashamed!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I just keep playing it over and over again
in my head.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Brandi, please, Dennis has called the police
and let’s just take this down to my office.</p>
<p><strong>department store manager</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: A Pervert attacked Brandi is what’s going
on!</p>
<p><strong>department store manager</strong>: Are you okay, Brandi?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Physically, yes. But psychologically,
no!</p>
<p>****: Did you call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: They’re on the way.</p>
<p><strong>department store manager</strong>: Yeah, we got to get her
the fuck out of here. Everybody’s standing around and nobody’s shopping.
This is bad for business.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m trying, but she just keeps crying.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi! I came as soon as I heard. Jesus,
are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’m fine, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: She’s fine, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This is one of the most heinous things I’ve
seen. Jesus, I tried to tell you about the skirts. It’s not your fault,
you little fighter you. Ronnie’s not mad, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, can you get her down to my office so
the Police can talk to her in private when they arrive.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I can’t walk right now. I feel like I’m in
shock.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll carry you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Oh, fucking Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Your secretary told me to come
on in. I’m Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Mark Talbert, I manage the mall. This is
Brandi, she’s the one who saw the deviant.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Hello, Brandi. Are you doing
okay?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’m really shaken up.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Yes, ma’am, I’m sure you are
after all you’ve been through, but I’m here to tell you that we’re going
to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector
on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is
my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement officer to another, I
just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to
coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to
justice.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Great. Okay, Brandi. Did you get
a look at the suspect?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Did you get a blood sample?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s a shame. Would have been useful.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Go ahead, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Thank you. Brandi, can you
remember anything specifically? What color was his hair? Was he tall or
short?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: He was tall and skinny and he had brown hair
and it was real greasy.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Was his hair long or short?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: It was long about to his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: No, he just stood there and you know,
touched himself.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What was he wearing?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Just a brown trench coat.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This is what I got so far.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What’s yours look like?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I just wrote a description.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Okay, Brandi, I think that’s
good for now. I think the best thing at this point is to just follow up
with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they
remember anything.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What if he comes back?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That’s highly unlikely. These
incidents are usually random and unpredictable. I’m sure you’ll be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m afraid I’m going to have to disagree
with you there, Detective. By my math, it seems pretty clear that
Brandi’s been targeted.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Targeted? What gives you that
impression?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, how about the fact that she was the
first employee to get assaulted? Not to mention the fact that she is the
prettiest girl who works at this mall. To me it seems obvious that this
is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish
what he started by murdering Brandi.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Is that going to happen?!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That’s not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Well don’t worry. I’m on the
case and I’m going to do everything in my power to bring this guy
down.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s right, Brandi, you’ve got the best
team in law enforcement working for you.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Look, I’ve got to get going.
Here’s my card. I’ll even write my home phone number on the back, just
in the event you need to get a hold of me.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Give me a call when you aren’t
working and I’ll have you come to the station to look through some mug
shots. Don’t worry okay.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I feel a lot better now.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ll take one of those cards as well.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Go ahead and write your home phone on there
as well in case I need to get a hold of you.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: You can just leave a message at
the station. I check my messages constantly.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sorry, but I’m gonna need those digits. If
we’re gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication
with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence. Brandi,
let me see that card.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Cool, I’ll call you later with an
update.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s no problem at all. We’re brothers of
the badge. This is what we do for each other.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Seems like a good guy. A little green, but
still solid.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Just putting these posters up.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: You’ve been so obsessed with catching this
pervert I’ve barely seen you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s what it’s like when you date the Head
of Mall Security. The downside is we don’t get to see each other as
much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Well, are you ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sure, let’s take off.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: What are you doing, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on, let me get some of those big
bazoombas.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie, no.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: You know we talked about this.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: We did, it’s just, well, I’m tired of just
doing what we do. I’m ready for something bigger. Like sex or just maybe
using a finger on you –</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie, you know I’m saving myself for
marriage. I thought you were okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I used to be, it’s just. I don’t know.
What’s so great about being a 27-year-old virgin?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nell, I’m sorry. Don’t go away like
this.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I thought you loved my purity.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I do. I really do. I’m sorry, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: It’s okay. I should leave anyway, it’s
late.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ll stop by for breakfast tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: See ya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom, wake up. Let’s go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good to see you, brother. Looks like the old
team is getting together to crack one more case.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m ready to go to war with you.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Thanks for waking me up this
morning, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ve already checked the Security tapes.
They didn’t catch a thing. Someone must have broken in here and turned
them off.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: My team just checked all the
doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I’ve also checked out the
crime scene, but we didn’t see any fingerprints on the glass. The
suspect was probably wearing gloves.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: That doesn’t sound good. How did they do
it?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Laser technology.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: My guess it was an inside job.
Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security
guard.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Detective Harrison, can I ask you how long
you’ve been a detective for?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m almost at the end of my
first year.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Just as I thought, a rookie.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’ve been a police officer for
several years.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, you’re a rookie, okay. It’s fine,
you’ll learn with experience. And when you do, you’ll discover that rule
#1 of law enforcement is that you don’t ever turn on a fellow officer.
Now, I know you would never actually accuse somebody on my Security
Force of committing this act of lawlessness.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Whoever did this would have to
had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Look, my record speaks for itself and as for
Dennis, well I can certainly vouch for him. Dennis is one of the finest
men I know, so just take my word, you’re barking up the wrong tree. Now,
let’s put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the
guys that robbed this mall.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, nobody is accusing
anybody, but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some
of the employees.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Okay, but all I ask is that you do it quietly,
so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I understand too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison
alone and let him handle the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No can do, Mark. When you appointed me Head
of Mall Security, I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in
bringing crime to its knees.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You didn’t swear an oath.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: To myself I did.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, on these types of
investigations, it’s usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in
the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: There’s only one cook. I’m a chef. A cook
and chef, together, serving up justice.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m gonna do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hot plates of justice.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on, rookie. Let me show you the lay of
the land.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, Dennis. I’ve gotta hang with Detective
Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What I need for you to understand is that
just because Detective Harrison is here, doesn’t mean that you and me
are no longer best friends. Sure, Harrison would be cool to hang out
with. He carries a badge and a gun. He probably owns a boat. Over time,
we’ll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now,
you’re still number one. Now, I must leave you behind because duty
calls, so… chin up. Radio if you need anything.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: So, have you seen any suspicious
people hanging around the mall? Anybody who might have been casing the
stores?</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: Nah, man. I ain’t seen nothing.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Okay, well if you can think of
anything, here’s my card.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: My turn, Rookie.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What are you doing, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Solving the whole case right before your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, this is official police
business.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hello, Saddamn.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: What the fuck you want, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I want your ass to face the music is what I
want.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: Don’t come any further, bitch. The
restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, I appreciate your
enthusiasm, but just let me handle this. Have a good day, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So you’re just gonna let him slip right
through your fingers?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I have no reason to make him a
suspect.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No reason? Look at him. There’s every reason
in the goddamn book.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: Why are you saying that, man?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I think it’s obvious, Saddamn.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: That’s fucked up. You’re racist, man.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re not even black.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, stop. We’re finished
here. Now if you’re going to tag along, I’m gonna need you to just stay
back; are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Sure, sorry. We’re crystal.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: What’s up, girl, you got a boyfriend? Free
cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for
free.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Did you let anybody borrow your
keys?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: No, senor.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Have you seen anything
suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: No, senor.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Okay, sir. Thank you for your
time.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Alright, I believe I can be of some
assistance here.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, we talked about
this.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This is a special circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What special circumstance?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Communication skills, watch and learn.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Que pasa?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Long drawn out conversation in Spanish?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Como?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: More Spanish dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Si. Yeah, this guy definitely did it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t speak Spanish, but
judging from his tonal inflections, it’s safe to say that he’s hiding
something. The only question is where. Okay, Ramon, I’m giving you one
chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is
going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good cop, bad cop, just play along. Where
are you hiding the jewels?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: No se.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Alright, you’re gonna make me be the bad guy
here? Well, that’s a role I’m comfortable playing. Let’s just see what
you’re hiding.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Think you’re pretty slick, don’t you? Guess
what? I’m pretty slick too.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Alright, you’re free – Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, my mistake. Sir, you’re free to go.
Uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is
you, so, uh, chop- chop. Wouldn’t want anyone to slip on this mess.</p>
<p><strong>hot clerk</strong>: Hello, can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m Detective Harrison with the
Cabarrus County Police.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: And I’m Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall
Security.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Okay, seriously, would you back
the fuck off?! I’m trying to do my job and you’re fucking it up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on, we’re working here.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m working!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Sorry. Hi. I’m doing a check
with all the mall employees to see if anybody has any information on the
robbery that took place here last night?</p>
<p><strong>hot clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, but I haven’t noticed anything
out of ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>sexy worker</strong>: Tracy, do you think my boyfriend would
like these?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That’s fine, thanks for the
help.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re gonna let them distract you with a
little bit of panty showing. You have got a lot to learn, my friend. Who
are you protecting, toots?</p>
<p><strong>hot clerk</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Look, I’m sure you and your little friend
have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. It’s probably easy for
you to blind most men with your beauty, but I’m not most men. I can see
through the sexuality to the truth. Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don’t
really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. I’m putting you on
my list of top suspects. I don’t think you did the crime, but I do think
you are an accomplice.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m sorry, ma’am. He’s not with
me. Here’s my card. If you think of anything, just give me a call.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Is that pot I smell?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Shut up, Ronnie!</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: It’s sage.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Whatever, hippy. If I find you doing drugs
or killing cats or whatever you devil worshippers do, I’ll come back
here and bust you. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Get the hell out, Ronnie. I’m
here to ask questions about the robbery.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Just forget that, we’re on to something
bigger here.</p>
<p>****: Tell me more about this ‘sage.’</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Now, maybe I’m crazy or maybe I’m the
smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell
hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case
in, oh say, a jewelry store.</p>
<p><strong>sears manager</strong>: Couldn’t you smash the glass with
anything?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You really think you’re gonna talk your way
out of this one?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You guys should have been there today. We
were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that’s what this job is
supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from
the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing
cases is where it’s at. It’s rewarding too because at the end of the
day, you know you’ve done something good for the world.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: What are we doing here, Ronnie? I thought
you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well – What is your name anyway?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Charles.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, my young apprentice. I called you here
today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it’s time to
take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat
this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I
have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on,
Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of
who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the
Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will
analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as
coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Since we’re going to be doing a lot of the
work and you’re going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get
paid?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You can’t measure honor in dollars and
cents.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Is that your girlfriend or something,
Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Who me? Nah, man. Why? What do you think of
her?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: She’s not my type, but that’s just me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, but, you don’t think she’s kind of
hot?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Are you blind? Give me a break. Wait, are
you sure she’s not your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fuck no. There’s no way I’d date that…
person who’s obviously not hot.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Anyway, our new unit will operate under the
name, ‘Special Elite Task Force.’ You will answer directly to me and no
one else. Now, let’s all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying
cheer.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You’re gonna hook me up with a job,
right?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Seven even. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: One, two, three, TASK FORCE!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, so now I say we all take a celebratory
trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all
automotive parts for mall employees.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s no interruption. What are you still
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I had to do inventory tonight. Bruce took
off early so I’m the last one. Hey, I was wondering if you would mind
walking me to my car. You know, just in case that freak with the dick is
out there someplace.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It would be my honor.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Alright, thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Just doing my job with a little something
extra especially for you.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: See ya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi, um… I was just thinking, would you
like to go to dinner this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: How come every time somebody does something
nice for me, they act like I owe them a blow job?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Look, it’s not like that. I’ve got a
girlfriend… who doesn’t work in this mall.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Ronnie, I got to be honest with you, you’re
not really my type.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Just out of curiosity, what is your
type?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Rich guys. Or guys who are really hot.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I guess that’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’ll go out to dinner with you on one
condition.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: This is not a date. Do you understand? We’re
going to dinner, but we are not going on a date.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: And you can never tell anybody we went
out.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: My lips are sealed.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: You pay for dinner, right? And as many
drinks as I want.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You may drink your fill.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: And you have to drive me to my car every
night after work for the next six months.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: And my car is low on gas, so I need some
money to fill it up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Is $20 enough?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Nah, fifty.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Okay, you can pick me up after work on
Saturday. Dinner and that’s it. Don’t try to kiss me because I’ll smack
the shit out of you. It’s not a date.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Got it. Not a date.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, Brandi.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I lied. It is a date.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Our suspension is over.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m not here for that. I need to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Anything you want to say to Stevie, you
can say to me, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: This is my cousin, Roy. He’s a boxer.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: You got a fuckin’ problem, bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: My eyes!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: As you know, we’ve had a lot of crime around
here lately. Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, I’ve decided to
go to the streets. Frankly, I’m looking for a stool pigeon and you’re
just the right person.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Why would I want to help you?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I could make it worth your while. You like
skating at the mall. I could allow you to skate here whenever you
wanted. In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any
information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Sorry, dude, but I’m no snitch. Go find
somebody else to do your dirty work.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, let me put it another way. If you
don’t help me, I’m gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this
flashlight up your ass. But like for real. Like I really will do that.
This is the new me talking and I get what I need, you understand me,
Stevie?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Alright, dude, I understand, you sick
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Cool. In that case, have fun shreadin’.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Stop crying, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Hey, sweetie – Oh, I’m sorry, good morning,
Officer Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good morning, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Where were you last night? I tried to call,
but your mom said you weren’t home from work yet.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Look, I got to talk to you about something.
I’m not really sure how to put this. Let’s see. If you drove a
Toyota.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I drive a Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I know, but let’s just pretend you drove a
Toyota. Now, this Toyota runs really good. It always starts when you
need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don’t have to do much to
maintain it. Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that
won’t work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street. Well, you may
really like that Toyota, but you’re going to feel weird about driving it
to work every day, right? Now let’s say that somebody offers you a
chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may
be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as
hell. What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You would trade up, Nell. Well, that’s
exactly what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Are you thinking about getting a new car?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, Nell, I’m getting a new girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: What?! Who?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This girl, Brandi.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: The slutty girl who works at the make-up
counter?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I mean, no, she’s not a slut. But
you’re thinking of the right person.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: How could you do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t mean to hurt you. It’s
just, well, I believe in this world, you play the hand you’re dealt and
at this point in my life, I’ve been dealt five Aces. I’d be a fool not
to bet.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Why are you doing this, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I have to, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Don’t you love me?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Of course I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Then tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Because I’ve never dated the prom queen
before.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Remember when you started this job? You
weren’t such a hotshot then. I’ve stood by you when you were at your
worst. Every time you fell, I held your hand and told you everything
would be okay. Time and time again.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on. Why do you have to bring that
up?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I never cared about who you wanted to be, I
fell in love with who you really are. If you leave me, Ronnie, I won’t
be there to pick you up when you fall.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Even if I do fall, it won’t matter, because
I’m learning to fly.</p>
<p><strong>slick salesman</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, um, I’ve got a really special date
tonight with a hot young lady – Do you know Brandi?</p>
<p><strong>slick salesman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Never mind. Anyway, I need something that’s
really ‘cool.’ Something that will impress her and I guess you could say
I’m not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these
days.</p>
<p><strong>slick salesman</strong>: Let’s see. Are you looking to fall
in love or are you looking to get laid?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Um, I guess love, but uh…</p>
<p><strong>slick salesman</strong>: You want to get laid, too?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Watch it, man. She’s a lady. But yes.</p>
<p><strong>slick salesman</strong>: Alright, I got just the thing.
Something classy is what you want. Show her you’re a man with taste.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Come on, Ronnie, just get out here.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s too tight in the butt.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ronnie, you look so handsome!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Really, you don’t think I look like a
phony.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hell no. You look like a stud muffin.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I guess these clothes are kind of
cool.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Nell is a lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Its not Nell, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Really, I thought you and Nell were going to
get married some day.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I did too. But then I met this girl Brandi
and she swept me off my feet.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, I always liked Nell, but as long as
you’re happy, Ronnie, that’s all I care about.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but
I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really
rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That sounds wonderful. Is she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: She is, Mom. She’s the most perfect girl in
the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I remember when your father picked me up for
our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever
laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man
that I married.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I hope that happens tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It will, Ronnie. Then you’ll have to give her a
ring like the one your father gave me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Is that a yellow diamond?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s a glass diamond. This is how it looks
now.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom, why did Dad leave?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, he kind of freaked out when you were
born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn’t handle the
pressure. One day, he just couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Do you think it was my fault that Dad
left?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Definitely. You don’t think it was mine do
you?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I didn’t know, with the drinking and
all.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Nope, it was all you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I love you, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I love you, too, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Damn, that was pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Yeah, work’s been pissing me off, so I just
need to blow off some steam.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, Brandi, can I just say that you look
absolutely beautiful tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Yeah, I know. Nurse! Get me another – You
got this, right?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, yeah. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Nurse! Bring me another and keep ’em coming.
I think it’s funny to call the waitress nurse.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Hey, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Don’t be stingy, what the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s just a pill I’m supposed to take.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Where the fuck did you find these?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: The Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I’m impressed. This
is the good shit. I didn’t know you partied like this.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I guess I party like this every four
to six hours as needed.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Let me get one.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Hell yeah!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So, how do you like working at the mall?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I hate that shit. All I do is listen to
bitching all day long. I got to put makeup on these fat- ass women all
day and it’s like, I don’t give a shit what you do, you can’t polish a
turd.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I see how that could get to you.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Let’s do some shots. Waiter, four shots of
Jager!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: It’s Friday.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So, Brandi, I hope I’m not being too
forward, but do you have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’ve got a few hook-ups but nobody who is a
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: You know, it’s just like a time in my life
where I want to be free right now and think about myself. Not get tied
down to one person.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I understand. I hate ties. I recently
cut mine and now I’m free like a bird.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Alright, bottoms up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: To new beginnings.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Right up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No more. I’m sticking to beer.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What’s wrong, is your pussy hurting?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: God, you remind me so much of my mother.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Feel the burn, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You are so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Who wants to see my titties?!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi, this is the most fun I’ve ever had
on a date.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: For the last time, this ain’t a date,
motherfucker! This is a party!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it’s no secret that
I’m attracted to you. I think everybody in the mall is. As you know, I
recently split with my girlfriend and basically, I was wondering if,
since you don’t have a boyfriend, that I could maybe be your boyfriend
and you could be my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: That’s my house!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’m so fucking shit-faced.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: My breath smells like asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I love you, Brandi.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I think I’ve got puke in my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Don’t look at me like that, Dennis. I told
you I wouldn’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m serious, Dennis. A gentleman never
kisses and tells. So, just stop with all the pressure because it’s just
not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want
details, I’ll give you details. I had sex with Brandi last night.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It was amazing. I mean, I’ve never
experienced anything like it. I’ve been with a girl or two.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, fine, I’ve been with a girl, but let
me tell you, this was so much better. You know how many times we did it?
Twice! BAM!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: But I got to tell you, Dennis. It was steamy
and sexy, but more than anything, I should tell you that it’s her soul
that I fell for the most. She got pretty tanked, but I could just really
tell that she’s a good person. The kind of person that I could see
myself with.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Look, I’m gonna get out of here. There’s a
lot of people I need to tell about this, so I’ll catch up with you
later. Oh, and I almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: How may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What is it, honey? Let me guess. You’re
looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that
puffiness under your eyes. I’ve got just the thing.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: No, that’s not it. Well, how much is it?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Fifty dollars for the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Okay, I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Listen, I know you’re Ronnie’s new
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: It’s okay. I know he left me to be with you
and I accept that.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I don’t know who you’ve been talking to, but
it’s safe to say that you’re fucking trippin’.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: It’s fine really. It’s going to take a while
for me to get over it, but I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Oh fuckin’ Lord. This is disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Pull it together. This is how you run around
all the time? Have some self-respect. No wonder your man left you. Who
the hell would want to be around this shit all day?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Jesus teaches us to forgive. And I forgive you
for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend. Plus, I feel pretty
confident that you’ll end up burning in hell because of the various evil
ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction. But I just
want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person. He does a lot of stupid
stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world. I want you to know
that if you hurt him and ruin his heart, I will personally come down
here and kick the ever living shit out of you.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: You better fuckin’ run, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I’m just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: It’s not too late to change your ways.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Ronnie, I’ve been expecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Oh yeah, I heard about last night.
Brandi is quite the woman. Congratulations, my friend. Or should I say,
welcome to the club?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What color of roses do the women like
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Well, it depends on what you are
trying to say. The white roses symbolize innocence and purity.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, we’re way past the color white if you
know what I mean. What about the yellow ones?</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Joy, happiness, appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t even know what to make of that.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: The pink rose means thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: The red rose is the most powerful.
It symbolizes love.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Why didn’t you just say that? I’m a busy man
here.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Forget it. Give me a big bag of the red
ones.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Um, can I ask a question?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Do you really like Brandi?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ve only been on one date with her, but I
could see myself being with her for all of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>flower salesman</strong>: Well, in that case, the greatest
symbol of love is just a single red rose.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Seems like a big bag of roses would be more
love than just one, but I guess you’re the expert. Gimme one.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I came here to see you. And to present you
with this single red rose. It symbolizes ‘love.’</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Ronnie, that’s really… uncalled for.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, after last night, I just wanted you to
know that it wasn’t just some fling to me. It meant something special
and I felt it deep in my soul.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You fucked the Security Guard?</p>
<p>****: You are such a little slut!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Oh, like you’ve never been drunk, Bruce!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Ronnie, look. I got to be honest with you. I
barely remember last night.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I remember it for the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Okay, see here’s the thing. I don’t know how
to say this, so I’m just gonna come on out with it. Ronnie, I could
never date you seriously. I mean, you’re a security guard.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m the head of Mall Security.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Exactly. The point is, I don’t really see
myself being with that. Like ever. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Brandi, I know exactly what you mean. And I
just want to thank you for being honest. You’re telling me I’m not
living up to my full potential in life. It’s funny, because I’ve been
feeling like this for quite some time. I guess I just needed that extra
little push to get me over this hurdle I’ve been stuck on. How can you
be with a man who isn’t living the life he was meant to?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Yeah, something like that. And just you
know, you’re a security guard at the mall and it’s like, come on, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t like it, Brandi, but I do
understand. I promise you this. Next time you see me, I will be wearing
a uniform that will make you proud. I will be the man that you will be
honored to call your life’s love.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Don’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I will though. I’ll bet everything I have on
you. Now I ask you for one favor. Although I am unworthy, will you
accept this rose from me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I can’t do that. And tell your girlfriend to
stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m here to become a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: We’re always on the hunt for new
recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I have a GED.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: We usually prefer an actual diploma, but
GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United
States?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You bet your ass I am.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several
steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police
academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: If you pass these tests, you will be
admitted to the police academy. Now, I like to tell all new recruits
that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. It’s
where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a
routine patrol. It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations
you’ll be dealing with. Sound good?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That sounds fun. Sign me up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s like it was meant to be. You behind the
wheel. Me riding shotgun. Two brothers of the badge unite to form the
ultimate crime-stopping combo. I’m psyched to be here, Harrison. Thank
you for the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: You requested to ride along with
me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I know. You want to know the truth. It’s
because I respect you. See, when we’re at the mall, it’s obviously my
turf. Sure, I break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the
streets, I’m the rookie. I’m here to learn. Teach me.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Why do you want to become a
Cop?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ve wanted to be a Police officer all my
life.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, I love keeping the mall
safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect,
not just our mall, but our whole community. I don’t tell the guys on my
squad this, but the Security Guard job was just temporary.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Well, just pay attention tonight
and make sure you stay out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Right, we’re not back at the station anymore
so we can cut the charade.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I know that policy demands I stay out
of the way, but between you and me, I just want you to know that if
anything pops off tonight, I’m going to jump right in there and take ’em
down with you.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: No, no. Ronnie, policy says you
have to stay in the car.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I get you. You have to say this in order to
keep you safe ‘legally’ speaking. I should probably follow along too. ‘I
swear I won’t get out of the car and fight justice tonight.’</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, you really can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m glad we understand each
other.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, so then I basically saw his ass trying
to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit. Not
allowed. The two ped exits are to be used only –</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: You see that corner there,
Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I see it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That corner used to be the worst
corner in this whole town. It was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and
gang violence. It was nicknamed ‘The Crossroads.’</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Shit, I’ve heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That’s right, but myself and the
other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks
of this neighborhood wouldn’t have to worry about being safe. Yes, sir,
that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t know. It looks pretty shitty to
me.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Well, it’s a low income area,
Ronnie. You’re being kind of prejudiced.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh, yeah, I can see that it’s basically a
fine neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That’s right, but it hasn’t been
easy. We still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence
up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I use that same technique at the mall.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I’m sure. I usually do the foot
patrols myself, but because I like you, I’m going to let you do it
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Yeah, really. But I told you
about department policy, so I’m going to need you to keep quiet about
this one.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You can count on me. Thank you for the
honor.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Of course, Ronnie. I just really
believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I won’t let you down.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Where are you going?!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, no horse play. You guys get on
home.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You want some crack?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, I don’t want any crack. In fact, I
didn’t want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. I’m
placing you under citizen’s arrest.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Let me go, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I place you under citizen’s arrest for the
crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the right to remain
silent…</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: … If you cannot afford an attorney, one will
be appointed to you. Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come
back.</p>
<p><strong>gang member #1</strong>: That’s my little brother you got
there.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Who, this little guy right here?</p>
<p><strong>gang member #1</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal
drugs. I know it’s hard for you to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>gang member #1</strong>: He works for me, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Is that so? Well then, it looks like you got
one less employee because I’m taking little brother down. I’ll die right
here before I let crime prevail.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Free to go, little brother. My mistake
completely. Good luck with the crack.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Alright, so I guess I’ll be seeing you
folks.</p>
<p><strong>gang member #2</strong>: Yo, waste this pig, Tone.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh, no. That’s really not necessary,
Tone.</p>
<p><strong>gang member #2</strong>: Do it, man.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Oh, Jesus, I don’t want to die. Don’t let me
die, don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, please! I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Ronnie stands up and looks around at
the pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal and also at
his best.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: I can’t believe you dropped him off at the
Crossroads. That’s fucking hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Trust me, you would have done
the same thing. This guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot I
have ever met.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: He’s probably going to get killed.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Good! Fuck him, I hope he does
get killed.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, what are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I know what you did!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, look, I didn’t do
anything –</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re not going to talk your way out of
this one. You set me up!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, look –</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Don’t try to deny it! You set me up and
that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, I –</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: And I just want to thank you for it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Thank me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Because I’m proud to report that I passed
the test. I know you wanted to see if I had the chops to cut it on the
police force and I’m glad to say that I passed. I knew I would get
initiated some time, but I didn’t think it would be so soon. Thank you,
Detective Harrison. Thank you for believing in me.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, I don’t know what to
say.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You don’t have to say anything. Your actions
speak for themselves. Thank you for giving this rookie a shot. Get used
to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt around here, boys.</p>
<p><strong>sprint</strong>: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and
starts the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line and hauls
ass down the track. The other Trainees fall behind Ronnie as he smokes
their asses.</p>
<p><strong>pull-ups</strong>: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do
pull- up after pull-up.</p>
<p><strong>side slide</strong>: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and
Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater that never
moves forward.</p>
<p><strong>sit-ups</strong>: Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups.</p>
<p><strong>obstacle course</strong>: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips
to the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps onto the rope
and swings safely to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>reads</strong>: CHAOS CLIMBS AT CAROLINA MALL. There’s a
KNOCK at the door.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good morning, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall is getting
butchered in the press. Somebody who works here is ripping the place
off. The cops don’t have any leads. I’m getting shit from the owner of
the mall. Sales are down. I mean, what’s so good about this morning?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I feel your pain, Mark. Quite frankly,
there’s two things happening. One, I’m lacking a sufficient firearm. And
two, we’re understaffed. That’s why I come to you this morning with a
plan. Come on in, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This is Charles, sir.</p>
<p>****: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You work at O’Charley’s, right.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mark, I would like to hire Charles here as
an additional Security Guard. He would operate under me. I figure with
the additional criminal element, we should hire more security in hopes
that we would have a better chance of catching these guys.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Do you have any experience, son?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Um, sir, I have personally been training
young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. The kid kind of
looks up to me. I’m some what of a big brother to the little guy.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Alright, it’s actually not a bad idea. It
might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion
that we’re on top of this.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Thank you, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if this crime
doesn’t come to an end pretty soon, we’re gonna have to let someone go.
I mean, you’ve always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone
is going to have to take the fall. You’re the one who wanted to be Head
of Mall Security and quite frankly, I just bought my wife a new
Cadillac, so let’s just say it won’t be me.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: With Charles on my team, I can now devote
more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these
wrapped up by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Why’d you just laugh?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: It’s nothing. Have fun, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Did I say something funny?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Let’s go, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Be careful, guys. Nice and slow.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: That’s not bad, but you need to learn to
speak in a more authoritative voice. Watch this. Slow it down! Slow it
down! You’ve already received one verbal, don’t make me issue a second!
See, you can’t be intimidated. You have to make them respect you.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Ronnie, you know I really want to thank you
for the job. You’re a man of your word.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No problem, my young student. So, I got
something to tell you. Keep this between us until it’s official, but I
don’t think I’m going to be here for much longer.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: You’re quitting? But you love this job.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I do love it, but it looks like someone is
going to be joining the police force.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The real police?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: They’re calling me up. It’s basically a done
deal. Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying
a gun.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I didn’t even know you wanted to become a
Cop.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s always been my job. The Mall thing is
great training, but it has its limitations. Some stars are just meant to
shine brighter than others.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Congrats, brother.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nell?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Hey, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Nothing, just getting in shape.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, that’s okay, I guess. Just watch your
speed, okay?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Isn’t that your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ex.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: She looked good.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: She looks a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Okay, Ronnie, today I’ll be giving you
a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you’re competent to enter into
the Police Academy. It’s really just a formality. Don’t want any serial
killers working for us, now do we?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, ma’am, we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Okay, Ronnie, so let’s start with your
background. Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Born and raised right here.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie, have you
ever been convicted of any crimes?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, ma’am. My record is totally clean.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Do you now take any illegal drugs or
have you taken any in the past?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, ma’am. I believe drugs are the path to
self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with
ruthless vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Any prescription medications?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yes, for my nerves. A man in my line of work
has a lot of stress to deal with. If you’ve seen the bloodshed I’ve
seen, you’d be on the meds too. I – Where are you going with this?</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Are you presently or have you ever
been affiliated with the Communist Party?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I can’t believe you’d even ask me that.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Have you ever been in the
military?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: What branch of the military were you
in?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: The kind of branch that doesn’t exist on
paper.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Okay, here’s a real world scenario.
You have a gun –</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: That wasn’t really the question, never
mind, I think I got that one. Um… here’s one. Do you feel like you would
work well on a team?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Would I? Yes. Would I be more useful working
alone, I would say definitely. I see myself more like a Rambo kind of
guy. A man who rolls solo. Taking care of business on his own terms.
Kind of like a Superhero or something.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Why do you want to become a cop?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I want to become a cop to help people. The
world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. See, I have this
vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I
stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away.
Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. I know I could do
some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot
better off.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is the
greatest danger facing a police officer today?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Maybe Russian gang activity, but you know
what? I think I’m gonna have to go with evil on that one too.</p>
<p><strong>psychologist</strong>: Okay, I think we’re good here. It’s
been a pleasure, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Thank you, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m telling you, Mom, this police thing
could be good for both of us. Not just the fact that I’ll be making the
streets safer for you, but they have health insurance and a pension plan
so I don’t have to worry about your medical bills as much.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t care about that bullshit. All I need is
a little nip of this good shit right here and I’m ready to walk through
the pearly gates.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom, I know, but maybe you should stop
drinking so much. You’re getting up there and you know what the doctor
said about your liver.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t tell you how to party, don’t tell me
how to live my life. I’ve taken care of you since you were born.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I just worry about you is all.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ronnie, don’t get your hopes up about this
police thing.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Why would you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You know why. I just don’t want to see you get
hurt. It’s my job to protect you from the bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom, I appreciate it, but I’m going to make
it as a police officer. I’m tired of coming in second all the time.
Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should I be any
different?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know. Just be careful is all. You’ve got a
good heart and I don’t want to see it broken.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, Mom. I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: And, Ronnie, one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What’s that, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom! That’s gross!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s right! Now you got to smell it!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I can see that. Listen, I don’t
really know how to say this, but we’re not going to be able to let you
join the academy.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What?! Why not?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: It seems you had a little
trouble passing the minimum requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Did I fail one of the tests?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Well, yes, actually, you failed
the psychological exam.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: It says… That Ronnie Barnhardt
shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts
his life and the lives of others in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Detective Harrison, you’ve got to believe
me. I’m completely sound. This has got to be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, I personally did your
background check and this is the fifth time you’ve been turned down for
the police academy.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You guys keep records on that?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: We sure do. Look, I tried to
talk to them, but there’s no way they’re gonna let you in. I’m sorry,
but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren’t going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I understand. Thanks for believing in me,
Detective. And just for the record, I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Take care, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>int. mall - day</strong>: Ronnie walks through the mall and
looks at the lights of the different shops. Everything looks colorful
and weird. Ronnie is in his own head. This isn’t the exciting world as
before, now it’s a disgusting fabricated make-believe land.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, Nell.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Hey, Ronnie. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I tried to get into the police academy again
and the same thing happened.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Oh, Ronnie, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Why does this keep happening to me,
Nell?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I don’t know, Ronnie. Maybe it’s just not
meant to be. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No. Are you going home? I mean, do you want
to go somewhere and talk or something?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’ve got plans.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What plans?</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: Look at this sorry piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What the fuck do you want?</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: I don’t want anything from you. How you
doing, sweetness?</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: You look beautiful tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: You ready to go? We got reservations at
9:00.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’m ready, Saddamn.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nell, for the love of God, don’t go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’m sorry, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Don’t go, Nell. Remember your purity!
Remember your purity!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What are you doing, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m just taking a break. What do you want,
Stevie? I don’t have time to fuck around with you today.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I got something.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Dude, I found these all over the mall. I’m
guessing that whoever this Mall Flasher is, left these for girls to
find.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This thing gets grosser and grosser all the
time. Well, thanks for the clue. Maybe I can use this to identify the
freak. You can skate all you want around here.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What’s wrong with you, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I don’t know. You just seem kind of sad.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nah, man, I’m fine. I mean, I’m catchin’
perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin’ the
dream.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: That’s cool. Look, man, you want to get
high?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, I don’t want to get high.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: And by the way, if I see you getting high, I
will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested. Don’t you
fuckin’ ever mistake my kindness for weakness. I hate drugs and I hate
you too.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Fine, you fucking dick.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I thought I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That motherfucker is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Well, you’re the fucking cop. Do
something.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: You’re right. Okay, here it
goes.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Ronnie, it’s me! Don’t do anything
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Get back inside, Brandi. This isn’t about
you… you… you slut!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Fuck off, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: How can you just stand there after you
ruined my life and act like nothing happened?!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: It’s easy ’cause I don’t give a</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Drop the flashlight, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re pretty tough with that gun.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie, I know you’ve had a hard
time –</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You were supposed to be my friend!</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: So you’re gonna kill Brandi?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I was just trying to scare her.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: You don’t scare me, you piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Ronnie!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you! And,
Harrison, you better be glad you have a gun or I’d kick your ass too.
And you know what? I’m taking my friendship back because you don’t
deserve it! And, Brandi, I’m taking my love back too. I’m gonna leave
now and you two can just have fun. Have fun sleeping tonight because
something tells me, you won’t be able to.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: That guy is a nut job.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: So you slept with him?</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I was drunk okay. You gonna make a big deal
out of it.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: No, I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>on the television</strong>: There’s an update on the CAROLINA
MALL FLASHER. It says he has exposed himself to more girls.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m disbanding the task force.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hey, Ronnie, that’s crazy talk. Are you
cool?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, I’m not cool, Charles. In fact, shit is
seriously fucked up. I’ve got to protect the whole mall by myself. Now,
I got you this fucking job, when are you going to stop being a little
baby and do something for a change.</p>
<p>****: ‘I don’t want to do anything hard. I just want to be a little
bitch and brag about dropping out of college.’ Grow a fucking pair, will
you, Chucky?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m gonna go check the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m sorry, Charles! I didn’t mean it,
buddy!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You know, Dennis, for the longest time I
made this job my whole life. I looked at this mall as a kingdom and I
looked at Mark as the King. I thought of myself as the first Knight and
the customers, well, they were the peasants. I lived by an old code
where one was bound by duty and honor. But now I don’t know if I believe
in that code anymore. I’ve lost my way. Now I just feel like it’s one
big kingdom of shit. Right now, I got half a mind just to let this whole
place burn. Burn it to the fucking ground!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’ve been waiting on you to get on my page
this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at
this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform
every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and
corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I’m a fucking outlaw and
I’m going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way,
but you’ve got to be willing to accept it. So I’m gonna ask you now,
Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re goddamn right I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Alright then. Let’s party.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: So, yeah, usually I take a joint straight to
the head before I start work in this motherfucker, but on really
stressful days, I like to get drunk too.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fuck it, give me the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: So then I usually come in here and perv out
on girls for about an hour or two. I hooked up twice last week. One was
this Asian chick and the other was this mom. She wasn’t that hot, but
what else do I got to do?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Sweet Jesus in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Dressing rooms are a great place to hide
out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here. You
can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal
time. Hey, hand me that camera.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Thanks, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Right before lunch I usually blaze up again
real good.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Hey, what’s up, motherfuckers?!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What up, Big Den?!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You know, smokin’ that good good.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Dude, why are you hanging out with
Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fuck you, Stevie!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Hey, Ronnie’s alright. Let me see that
stick.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: That’ll be $39.99.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: My wife’s gonna love this perfume.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I hope so. It’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Come on, brother. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, we need you down at the candy store.
Some little brat has been shoveling peanuts in his mouth for the last
hour.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Dennis, I got to thank you for today. Man, I
was so down, but you taught me that I don’t need to take things so
seriously here. We have a pointless existence. Who gives a fuck?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Don’t mention it, homey. I’m just glad I got
me a partner in crime.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: A partner. I like that. You know, I’ve never
really had a friend before, but I think that this could be the beginning
of a real good thing.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You ain’t even seen the best part. After
everybody leaves, I rob the shit out of this place.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I steal shit!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You’re the one who’s been robbing the
mall?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Hell yeah! Who’d you think it was?!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I can’t believe this. Right in front of my
goddamn face this whole time!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: This probably will look good with my
complexion.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Dennis, I can’t take part in this.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Ronnie, I thought you were down?! What the
fuck?! Here I am opening up myself to you and you’re just gonna stick it
to me like this. What the fuck has this place ever done for you? Don’t
you know that people see us as jokes?! A useless tool that’s left in the
shed. Well that’s not me. Not now, not ever. I told you, I’m an
outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I can’t let you rob the mall.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What the fuck you mean you can’t let me?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on, Dennis. We’re best friends, so just
put that stuff back and let’s go get a beer.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Alright, Ronnie, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I don’t really know what I was thinking.
Robbing the mall? Let’s just go get that beer.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Good, man. That makes me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: See ya in Mexico, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ramon, get your ass over here! Go get my
spare keys out of the office.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Ramon! Goddamn it get back here! Go get my
goddamn keys.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean
Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was
Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get
away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do
and you can’t do those worth a shit.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Can I speak now?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Just start talking, Ronnie!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It seems only natural that ‘some people’
would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on
myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not
catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was
the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly,
lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me. I carry this loss alone deep
inside my heart.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Good. Because you’re fired.</p>
<p>****: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m serious, Ronnie. I’ve always liked you,
but there’s just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I’ll be
damned if it’s going to be me. Now, don’t make a big thing out of this.
Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Wait a minute. I thought I could trust you,
Mark, and now you’re telling me that you’re going to be the one to put
the knife in my back. Fair weather friend you are.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m not your friend, I’m your boss.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You think you’re so smart, Mark. You don’t
know everything. If you’re firing me, then you can say goodbye to your
entire Security staff. Because there is no fucking way my team is going
to work here if you fire me. Isn’t that right, Charles?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Ronnie, I got to talk to you about this.
Mark asked me down here to escort you out.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: And you told him to fuck off, right?
Charles? Right?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What the fuck do you want from me,
Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: This isn’t happening! Everybody is fucking
me over?! I hate you all.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m sorry, Ronnie, but it’s time to go.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll work for free, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: No, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ll pay you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, Jesus have a little self- respect.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You don’t love me, Mark?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Ronnie, it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hey, Charles. Mark asked you down here in
case I got out of hand? Well, get ready to earn your money.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Alright, Ronnie, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>time lapse</strong>: The sun rises and sets three times
through the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days have
passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn’t move from his bed.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What’s on the agenda for today?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I guess maybe look for a job or
something.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, I know you’re sad about it, but try to
look on the bright side.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: There is no bright side. My life is
over.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but
you’ve got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special. No matter
what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams
away.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about,
Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I don’t know. I’m drunk. I just know that
mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they’re
sad, so I tried. What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Nothing. That’s exactly what you’re supposed
to do. I just blew my life. I tried to be a big shot, a hero and a
stupid cop. I wanted to be recognized for being great. I should have
just been happy where I was at. I didn’t do my duty.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ronnie, the other night when I soiled my pants
right before I puked myself, I was thinking about how you would come
home and find me and clean me up. I knew you would be there to find me
and take care of me, so I was able to pass out on the floor and not
worry. If there’s one thing you know about, it’s duty.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I do it because I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know and I love you too, Ronnie. I haven’t
always been easy to deal with and most people would have thrown me away
a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Just like your father did. But not you, Ronnie.
Look, whiskey was always the way I dealt with being a single mother, but
as I get older, I know that I can’t keep doing this. I’ve got everything
I need with you. So I want you to know that I’m ready to make a change.
Your life needs to get easier and you don’t need to take care of old Mom
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Are you going to quit drinking?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m switching to beer. I can pound those all
day and still keep my shit together. I’m doing it for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m so proud of you, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m proud of you. Now today is a new day and
we’re going to get through it. Now, get out there and find what the
world has in store for you.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What’s up, Ronnie? How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ve been better. You?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m holding it down in here.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I heard they finally caught up with
you.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I know. I should have hit Mexico, but, you
know, I got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You know they fired me when they found out
you were the one who robbed the mall.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Shit, dog. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s cool, but I need to know why you did
it.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I told you. I’m an outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Come on, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Man, you want to know the real reason?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Alright, I’ll tell you. Man, that gig was
one of the best jobs I ever had. I got to wear a uniform, I could smoke
weed whenever I wanted. For once in my life, I felt like I was actually
somebody. I know most people don’t think it’s shit, but I really loved
it. Then, all of a sudden, I find out that your ass got promoted over
me.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: After all I put into it, you’re the one that
makes it to Head of Mall Security. You know what it’s like to get passed
over, Ronnie? So I got pissed off. I started robbing the joint as a way
to get at them for what they did to me. But you know what, Ronnie?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You ever love a girl so much that you can’t
break up with her, so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off
is smack her in the goddamn face?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: No, Dennis, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, I have. And that’s pretty much how I
felt about the job.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Thanks for talking to me, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, it’s the least I could do after
knocking you out and all.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Hey, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Bail me out of here, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I can’t do it, Dennis. You’re now a criminal
who stopped caring, but my crime is that I care too much.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Ronnie, what are you doing back here?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I just came to talk to Nell. Don’t get your
panties in a wad, I’m just here as any normal patron.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Ronnie, dude, I’ve been all fucked up in
the head. I feel like shit about what happened. I mean, here I am, just
looking to shuck responsibility and I ended up hurting you in the
process. Look, I should have been honest with you. I don’t give two
shits about this stupid job. But you do.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: It’s okay, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’ve decided I’m going back to college.
Getting stoned and studying beats this any day. I realize that now. I
realize that there aren’t any jobs where you can avoid hard choices.
Anyway, take as long as you want at the mall. I’ll keep Mark off your
back.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Thanks, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I got something I want to say.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I don’t think we should be talking.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’ll be quick. Nell, this is the only job I
was ever any good at. I’m not a crime solver or right hand of the law.
I’m just a dumb guy in a uniform who can’t even become a real policeman.
Somewhere along the way I started to think I was something special,
someone whose shit didn’t stink, someone who deserved to date out of my
league. You know, I’ve learned. My shit does stink. It smells horrible.
And you’re also out of my league, but for some reason, you like the
smell of my shit. I guess what I’m saying is…</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: If you give me another chance, I’ll spend
the rest of my life making it up to you. And you can call me sweetie in
front of people and I’ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Son of a bitch!!!</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Shit, we should call somebody.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Go get him.</p>
<p><strong>saddamn</strong>: What the fuck, man?!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Stay the fuck away from my wife!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Dude, that’s fucking disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Hey, Ronnie, here!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What a fucking douche!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Okay, Ramon, we’re fucking even!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Turn it down. Turn it down.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Okay, show’s over. Enjoy your shopping
experience at Carolina Mall.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Jesus. Charles!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Call the police. And go get Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: He’s trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Just do what I ask you.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hey, Ronnie!</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fuck yeah!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: You want to report this to the police.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Hell no. I’m taking him down myself.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Good job, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: Good job, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I don’t love you!</p>
<p><strong>brandi</strong>: I don’t love you either.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I caught the Pervert.</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: I see that. Well, you better
turn him over to me and I’ll take him inside and book him.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Since you’re a real Cop, right?</p>
<p><strong>detective harrison</strong>: Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an
officer of the law, but you’re the law’s right hand. Good job.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: You had an eyelash?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: I’m trying to remember my speech.</p>
<p><strong>nell</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Okay, Ronnie, we’re ready for
you.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Okay, we rolling?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Good evening. We’re here today with
Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall. Last
week, Ronnie was able to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER single-handed
and bring him to justice. Ronnie, how did you manage to find the
identity of The Pervert and take him down?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Well, being a mall security guard basically
requires the same skill set that someone in say the FBI has. You have to
use logic and evidence and old-fashioned common sense as well as the
latest technology to deduce the criminal mind. It’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: Any last words for the folks at
home.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Yeah, I’d just like to say that Carolina
Mall is back on track and safer than ever…</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: In fact, there are some wonderful sales
taking place right now.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: So for all you families out there, come on
down and see us. It’s a wonderful place.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: You heard it, folks. Everything is
back to normal here at Carolina Mall. Back to you, Lindsay.</p>
