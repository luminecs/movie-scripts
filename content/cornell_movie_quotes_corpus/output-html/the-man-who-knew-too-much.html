<p><strong>final draft</strong>: May 7, 1955</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Daddy – you sure I never been to Africa
before? It looks familiar.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We saw the same scenery last summer driving to
Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that money at
the cr –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hank!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: – table.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hey look - a camel!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: This isn’t really Africa, Hank. It’s French
Morocco.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Northern Africa.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Still seems like Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re only a hundred miles north of the Sahara
Desert!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I dunno. In school they called it the Dark
Continent. It’s twice as bright as Indianapolis!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just wait till you see Marrakesh.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Marrakesh. Sounds like a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You bet it does.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Simmer
down.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d like to thank you. Without your help,
anything might have happened.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments in
life when we all need a little help.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How do you do, madame. My name is Louis
Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And this is our son, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hallo, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You talk Arab talk.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A few words.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why was he so angry? It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The Moslem religion allows for few accidents.
May I be permitted to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, sure, sure. 0f course. Next to Jo,
there.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I thought his name was Hank.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, uh –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s my wife’s name. Jo. Jay oh. No “e.”</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How different.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: For Josephine. Called her Jo so long, nobody
knows her by any other name.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I do. Mummy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Now about the “accident.” You see, a Moslem
woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: They feed her intervaneously?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Quite a big word for such a small boy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh. Well, he sounds like one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He can spell “haemoglobin” – but he has trouble
with “cat” and “dog.”</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And where do you practice, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Indianapolis, Indiana. The Good Samaritan.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What brings you to Marrakesh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’ve been to a medical convention in Paris.
And while we were in Europe, I thought I’d like to see Morocco
again.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Daddy liberated Africa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was up around Casablanca with an Army field
hospital, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh no. I suppose you came directly from
Paris?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few days.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: And Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I hope you will have time to truly enjoy
Marrakesh.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: At the most we’ll have three days.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You will naturally be stopping at the hotel
Mamounia or La Menara?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They are hotels for tourists of good
taste.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Do you eat snails.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: When I’m lucky enough to got them.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: If you ever get hungry, our garden back home
is full of snails.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: That’s all right. We tried everything to got
rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Next time take the train.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Would you like to share our taxi to the
hotel?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately
I have some business first.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: However, I’ll be there later - perhaps we
might have a drink together.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right. But I’ll serve the drinks in our
suite.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: In that case, I will take you to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. Now that’s not a fair bargain.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an
intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner
of eating exotic.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well – that’s what we came here for. Okay, Jo?
Simple one of those Arabian Nights?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Okay, But I’m no Scheherazade.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How would you prefer to travel to the hotel?
By taxi? Fiacre?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: A wagon! I want to ride in a wagon!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Au revoir. I look forward to cocktails.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See you later. And thinks again.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I don’t like people who pat me on the
head.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The carriage awaits, madame.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: How do you like this! A horse-drawn
convertible!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hold on. Hold on! Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Ben – I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that
Arab.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What Arab?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: The one who was shouting at Hank for taking the
woman’s veil. He and the Frenchman were talking like old friends.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right. Let’s assume they knew each other,
and Louis Bernard didn’t bother to tell us. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It means Mr. Bernard is a very mysterious
man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He struck me as quite normaL</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know his name…and, uh….</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You see? And he knows you’ re an American living
in Indianapolis, Indiana. A doctor at the Good Samaritan. You have a
garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. You went to
a medical convention in Paris. Stopped at Rome, Lisbon, Casablanca. You
once served in North Africa with an Army field Hospital –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now hold on. Wait a minute. We were just
talking casually…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Not talking.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He was asking, you were telling. You might as
well have handed him your passport.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What difference does it make? I have nothing to
hide.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Maybe Mr. Bernard has.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco.
Inscrutable natives gliding through twisted, narrow streets, but –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: being taken</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then relax. You’re just mad because he didn’t
ask any questions about you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Bitter medicine, doctor. But I’ll swallow
it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well. This eases the pain.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What pain, mummy?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Just an expression.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Bon jour, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you take care of the driver?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Qui, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My name is McKenna, Doctor McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’ll take care of everything, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Est-ce que vous etes libre? Jevous
prend.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Oui, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’re being watched.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh come on.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: How about it, mummy? One chorus.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m a little out of form, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: One chorus, and that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All right, Mr. Hammerstein. What’s your
pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Quo Sera Sera. Like you and Alfred Drake. I’ll
be Alfred Drake.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What’s your key?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Whatever I happen to hit.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Pretty original.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: When I was lust a little boy I asked my mother
“What will I be?” Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? Here’s what she
said to me:</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The
future’s not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera
Sera.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: When I was just a child in school I asked my
teacher “What should I try” Should I paint pictures? Should I sing
songs? This was her wise reply:</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The
future’s not ours to see Que Sera Sera! Whatever will be will be Que
Sera Sera!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Now I have children of my own They ask their
mother “What will I be?” Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them
tenderly:</p>
<p><strong>hank and jo</strong>: Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be
The future’s not ours to see Que Sera Sera! What will be will be Que
Sera Sera!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: There goes our sock finish!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Dinaire for thee boy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right in there.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t tell you how beautifully your wife
sings.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. She is pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She’s marvelous. Too bad it was
interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve had the same feeling. Often.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He said the manager is going to send up somebody
to baby sit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Mrs. McKenna, permit me the pleasure of
serving you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Were you on the American stage,
Mrs. McKenna?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Madame.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you. Let’s sit where it’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, I was on the American stage, and the London
stage, and even the Paris stage.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I thought you might have seen me in Paris –
being French, and –</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The theater, requires time, and for me time
is often a luxury.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Have you ever been to Paris, Mr. Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I was born there.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: What do you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Buy and sell.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Whatever gives the best profit.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Just what are you buying, or selling, now in
Marrakesh?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You know, I would much rather talk about the
stage. If you tell me what to answer any?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll answer it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excusez moi, mais is cherche la chambre do
Monsieur Montgomery.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: I am inquiring for the room of a Monsieur
Montgomery. He asked me for a drink, and l –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry, there’s no Montgomery here.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: Then pardon me, monsieur, I regret disturbing
you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Mummy – I can’t cut this meat!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll do it, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: May I use your telephone?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go to
dinner with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Bonsoir, Madame, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good evening. My name is McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Of course. The hotel phoned. Follow me
please.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: I think you will find this
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sit down, Jo, please. People are staring at
us.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re right. People are staring at us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What people?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: They stared at us when we went into the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo, will you stop imagining things?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: You must think me awfully rude. I’ve
been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Didn’t I tell you? I knew I was
right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: I’m Lucy Drayton, and this is my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: How do you do, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you do. We’re Mr. and Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at
the London Palladium a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Of course we hardly ever see a show.
Edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud. So I have to console myself
with your records.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: And I must admit I love ’em. I’m not one
for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Drayton.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: When are you coming back to
London?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Possibly never again, professionally.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Don’t tell me you’ve given up the
stage.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s just that I’m a doctor… Yes. And a
doctor’s wife…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What Ben means is that there are no Broadway
musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived
in New York… …where I hear doctors aren’t starving…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have nothing against working in New York.
Nothing except the fact that it’s very hard for my patients to come all
the way from Indianapolis for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Oh dear, oh dear. I’m always saying
the wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Not the least, Mrs. Drayton.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Tell me; Dr. McKenna do you
always…..</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you think we could get straightened
around.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Only the first two fingers and thumb of the
right hand. Never use the smaller fingers. And always keep the left hand
in the lap.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Does it have something to do with religion?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: More social than religious, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It seems to me if you have four good fingers,
and a thumb, you should use them all.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Three finger – four fingers – for my money this
is nothing but chicken in the rough. We have it at every drive- in back
home.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy
farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the
United Nations started worrying me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Edward was a big noise at the Ministry
of Food during the war, you know.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: So, I pulled myself up by the roots, and
here we are. United Nations Relief.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That sounds like interesting work.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: You should see my report on soil erosion in
Morocco… But nobody reads it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Trouvez nous un coin tranquille – C’est
possible?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Certainment, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well just what do you think of that? First he
promises to take us to dinner –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, we only met him today. We can’t expect
him to change his whole life –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Oh, Ben! What’s the matter with you?!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nothing! What’s the matter with you?!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I just don’t like to be both privately and
publicly insulted.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can you blame him? Turning down an old married
couple for a date with a girl like that?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’re not an old married couple! All right –
He’s a heel. I don’t understand him – and I’m beginning not to like what
he’s doing to our whole night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: I must do some shopping in the market
tomorrow. I do hope it’ll be fine. Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I
how our English weather is awful, but I sometimes think we don’t know
when we’re lucky. All this sunshine, day after day. It seems unnatural,
somehow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I want to get up.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, I know you – once you get worked up, you’ll
start a fight. Now please, sit down and forget him.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: By the way, it’d be pleasant if you’d let
us show you round the market place, tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was
going to take us through the market tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good. I’ll just go over and cancel out.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, don’t. Our dinner’s getting cold. We’d love
to go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I don’t know why Ben gets so worked up over
unimportant things.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: C’est les deux que cherchez?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Looks like he has a cure for everything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, there’s a lot of that going around these
days.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What’s he doing, Mrs. Drayton?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: He’s the teller of tales, Hank. He
reads legends and famous old stories from history.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Wish he’d say something I could
understand.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Ben, I’m glad we came here. It’s different, a
little exciting.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wouldn’t you rather be in Now York –
rehearsing?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Oh, all that talk last night was just social
chit chat, Every woman who ever gave up the stage for marriage is
supposed to want to go back. I was just playing a part expected of
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, if you do – let’s talk about it –
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No, if at all, let’s talk about it
humorously.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Mummy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Come on with us! We’re gonna see the medicine
man! Maybe you on learn something, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Any time he starts wearing you out –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: I’ve never enjoyed the market place so
much. Oh!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, this whole market place is very different
and exciting.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just like the county fairs when I was a kid.
They’d get everything but the balloon ascension.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That didn’t sound too hilarious to me.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was just thinking…do you know what’s paying
for these three days in Marrakesh?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And the purse I bought in Paris…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Mummy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Come on with us! We’re gonna see the medicine
man! Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Any time he starts wearing you out…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know whether or not to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, glamour is a costume I put on once. It
never fit too well. I’d rather live my own life than one written for
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Including sleeping with a man who always smells
of ether?</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: I don’t have to look seductive at breakfast and
worry if the Times reviewer doesn’t like my scrambled eggs.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: How are the acrobats today?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh fine, fine. Haven’t dropped anybody yet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All the way home we’ll be riding on Herbie
Taylor’s ulcors.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: And Allida Markle’s asthma.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, I know it’s just a song and a dance here
and there… but it’s all he thinks about. Show business.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, you’re setting a trap for me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He has a good mind. Give him a chance to
develop it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You mean give him a change to be a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All right, darling, a deal’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: For every time step he’ll learn a new muscle –
and for every chorus, three bones.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And for every matinee?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Two chapters of Grey’s Anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hey, Mummy. Sewing machines! Looks like a
television commercial.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now If we could only get four cases of the
Seven-year itch, we could retire. Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has
triplets, we could at least redecorate the house.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Oh, Ben, what would they say if they heard
us?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: One of the reasons I came to a place like
Marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody
hearing us.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’d like to say something where nobody can hear
us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is the safest place.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: When are we going to have another child?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re the doctor. You have all the answers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah – but, but this is the first time I’ve
heard the question!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hey, Mummy. Sewing machines! Looks like a
television commercial.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Having a good time, Hank?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: He’s delighted with everything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hank! Hank – come back here!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hank!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Hank, it’s best to keep away from
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: It looks as though the police are
chasing somebody.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ils ont trouv�s… ils ont r�ussi �
trouver…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: McKenna… I’m… Louis…. Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: McKenna – listen to me – first!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A man…a statesman…is to be
killed…assassinated…in London…soon…very soon…tell them…in London…to try
Ambrose Chappell…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben – who is he?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Louis Bernard. Got something to write on?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. Yes. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>police one</strong>: Savez vous qui est cet homme?</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: J’ai dit: Savez vous qui est cet homme?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Il ne parle pas francais. Je traduir�i.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: He wants to find out if you know this
man.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Of course we know him! It’s the frenchman, Louis
Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>police one</strong>: Louis Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>police man</strong>: Quel est le nom de ces personnes?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>police man</strong>: Dites leur que j’aimerai qu’ils viennent
tous les deux au commissariat pour faire un rapport.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Just as I thought. He wants both of you to
go to police headquarters to make a statement.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do we have to?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I’m afraid so. Our friends here have to go
to the police Station. I’m going with them to give what help I can.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: You don’t want your little boy to go,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I wanna go. I never saw a French police
station before.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Perhaps it would be best if I took him
back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re very thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>police one</strong>: Ameneles aux Bureaux de Police.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I think we’d better set off. Heaven knows
how long we shall be.</p>
<p><strong>police twoo</strong>: Alons-y. Sil vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab- outfit,
wearing makeup?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s more important – why was he killed?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll bet he was a spy, or something like
that.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, what did he whisper to you? What did you
write down?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll tell you later.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t feel very good after what I said about
Louis Bernard last night.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Once we talk to the police inspector, I’ll
do my best to out some of the red tape.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I have to stretch.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I’m afraid the questions will go on till
doomsday, if you admit knew this chap Bernard before.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t know him at all. We only met yesterday
on a bus.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: They’re a cynical lot, these French – they
might refuse to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They’ll have to believe me. It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: It might sound a bit odd, from their point
of view. They saw the poor chap whispering to you … and then they saw
you writing something down…</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: The question is, are you going to show them
what you wrote down?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les
McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m’ont
demand� de traduire.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a
translator will not be necessary. Won’t you come inside, Monsieur,
Madame?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Do to the kindness to wait. I might have
questions for you later.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Your passports, please.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You entered French Morocco four days
ago.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You are a doctor, monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A surgeon. A tourist, and an American
citizen.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Three good reasons why you should have
nothing in common with Louis Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You were recently in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A medical convention.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You come to Marrakesh with him in the
same bus. You drank an ap�ritif with him in your hotel room. And you ate
at the same restaurant last night.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: But at different tables.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to
you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I met him yesterday – on the bus – for the
first time in my life.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: And yet – out of five thousand people –
In a great market place – he comes to you when he is about to die! Is
that the action of a casual acquaintance, monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know nothing about Louis Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: No? Not even, I suppose, that he was an
agent of the D�uxieme Bureau?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Perhaps you have also never head of the
American F.B.I.? It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur,
if you would cease to pretend.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now, look here…</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: The dead man found out what he had been
sent here to discover. That is why he was kill-ed. He told you what he
had discovered. Why? Because he placed complete confidence in you.
Voila.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Boy, you not only ask the questions you also
answer them – Wait a minute let me ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Indeed, Monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as
you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find
it desirable to betray a confidence?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s get something straight. I’m a tourist
traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate
incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not
to be subjected to a police grilling.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Monsieur, I would like….</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now hold your horses! Just hold them.</p>
<p><strong>police two</strong>: Inspecteur. On demande Monsieur McKenna
au t�l�phone.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Laissez nous, nous sommes occuppes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute. A telephone call for me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Mais enfin, voyons!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll take the call now. You just take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Madame McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I don’t know a thing,</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: Doctor McKenna?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is McKenna. Who’s calling me?</p>
<p><strong>arab</strong>: You tell even one word of that Louis Bernard
whispered to you in the market- place – your little boy will be in
serious danger.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Drayton!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Didn’t your wife say she was taking Hank
straight back to the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: As I recall. Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Call her. Somebody just threatened me about
Hank. See if he’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Passez moi l’h�tel Mamounia, s’il vous
plait. Voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept s’il vous
plait…. je vois, Puis-je parler au, concierge?…Ah! ici Mr. Drayton de la
chambre deux cents dix sept. Est ce que ma femme est revenue a l’h�tel
depuis une heure? Sa chambre ne r�pond pas…. je vois… bien… bien… merci…
Oh! Un instant s’il vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Four fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents
quatorze?…Merci.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She didn’t come back?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: At least nobody’s seen her. What on
earth…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look – you get back to the hotel right away –
and see if you can find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: It’s so unlike my wife…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll finish up with the police and join you as
soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Right. But don’t worry. Probably some
stupid misunderstanding. If I find out anything before you get back,
I’ll ring you here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just don’t waste any time!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Who was it, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He heard we
were being held by the Police and thought there was some way he could
help us.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: That was nice of him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I told him if we weren’t back there in fifteen
minutes to call the American Consulate in Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: But, Monsieur, if you had only told me in
the first place, that you wished to consult with your consul!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s go, Jo.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: There is just one small formality. I must
request you to sign a statement of the facts.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If it doesn’t take too long.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: But a moment. I will send for a
typist.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Let me see the message.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t – I don’t think you should.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m your wife, Ben – not the police inspector.
Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Why didn’t you give this to the police?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I didn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: But Ben, a man’s life –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: …is at stake, I know, But I’m not sure of
what’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: I thought we ought to go back to the hotel, pack
our clothes, take Hank, and get out of this country as quickly as we
can.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hank, seeing a man killed in front of him. What
a shook it must be to his mind.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why don’t you just give that note to the
American Consulate – Why get any more involved?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo…about Hank…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well…he…he’s the kind of a kid who can take of
himself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You get the key. I’ll take care of the
driver.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Uh…pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: Yes, m’sieu?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you know Mrs. Drayton?</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: The English lady?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you see her come back from the market place
anytime in the past hour or so?</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: No, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute. You don’t understand… she had a
small boy with her. Mine.</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: No, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How about Mister Drayton?</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: Oui, m’sieu. M’sieu Drayton check
out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: Checked out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: Oui, m’sieu. He did.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with
horn-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p><strong>head porter</strong>: Oui, m’sieu. Checked out.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, What’s holding you up?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Frankly, I’m exhausted. Don’t you feel well?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her we’re back.
She can bring Hank up here, or I’ll go get his.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo, hold the call for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I asked you to.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben…we’re about to have our monthly fight.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I hope we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Then stop playing Rasputin. I only said I was
going to call Mrs. Drayton.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait ’til I come back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Something to relax you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m so relaxed I’m tired. You take them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo, they’re for you. I’m the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know how you get when things happen – tense
and upset. Now do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Six months ago you told me I took too many
pills!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Six months ago you weren’t a witness to a
murder. You’ve been excited, fatigued – talking a blue streak and going
around in circles.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I have not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to
administer medicine. You’ll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these
today. But you don’t think so. Okay, I’ll make a deal with you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There’s something about Louis Bernard, the
police station, and this whole spy business that I haven’t told you
yet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is the price of curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What could it be?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There’s one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All right, Doctor McKenna. I am now relaxed and
listening.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why don’t I call Mrs. Drayton first. You can
tell me while she’s bringing Hank up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just a minute. This whole thing strange right
from the very beginning.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was no accident that Louis Bernard helped us
out on the bus, and struck up a conversation. You were right about
him.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes…yes, you were right about him. He was…was
strange.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I know all that. Get to the surprise.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He got talking to us because he was on the
lookout for a suspicious married couple.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Nothing suspicious about us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He was wrong. It was a different married
couple.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And he was killed before he found them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. He found them. In the restaurant. Last
night. That’s why he was killed.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’ll be telling me next it was Mr. and
Mrs. Drayton!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s just who it was, Jo.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: If that’s a joke, I don’t think it’s a very
funny one.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Think I’ll lie down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen to me. And listen carefully.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That phone call I received at the police
station.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It wasn’t from the concierge at the hotel. It
was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one
word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that
something…something might happen to…to, to Hank.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hank? Why H… ?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They’ve taken him away.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is
downstairs!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back
here! And Hank didn’t either!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well let’s start looking for him.
Mr. Drayton…Mr. Drayton should…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the hotel
thirty or forty minutes ago!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben!! I could kill you! Sedative!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you
wouldn’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wasn’t sure, until now.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He’s my child more than yours! I had him.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Let go of me! I’ll never never never forget
this! We’ve got to find Hank! We’ve got to find him.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You think you’re the only one strong enough to
take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart. Hank! Where is
Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human…how
could anybody…do…</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: I…never wanted to…come here in…first…Place…oh
Hank, Hank darling…if I ever…wake…I’ll kill…you…you…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Darling, if somebody did this to me, I’d say
just what you said.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There’s still no news of him, Jo.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Both the Draytons are definitely gone. The
hotel register says they come from London. Drayton told the concierge he
was a college professor. The only thing to do now is to get out of
Marrakesh.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: As individuals we’re helpless here. And because
of that phone call, we can’t bring the police in on it. I even thought
of taking that chance.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But connect Hank’s disappearance to Louis
Bernard’s murder. And the first thing they’d do would be to make me tell
them Louis Bernard’s message. That…that could be, Hank’s…well, it
wouldn’t help him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re going to London.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I found out. The Draytons had a private plane –
that’s how they took Hank back. It could lend anywhere – no question of
a passport or anything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So we’re going to London to find him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A Man…a statesman…is to be killed… assassinated
… in London…soon…very soon…tell them…in London…to try Ambrose Chappell…
We’re going to try this Ambrose Chappell and if he has anything at all
to do with this, I’m going to offer him every cent I’ve got to got Hank
back. This Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope. Understand, Jo?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’ve only got a few hours, Jo! We have to got
up and start moving.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve paid the bill, and there’s a car waiting
downstairs. As soon as I pack, we’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Oh Ben, Ben, Ben…where is he? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Would you mind waiting for the press
photographers?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: How could they remember me so well, Ben? It’s
been four years since I played London.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I guess you’re the kind of girl they don’t
forget.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: But how did they know…who could have told
them…Ben, you didn’t…?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell to get
us rooms –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But I didn’t count on this –</p>
<p><strong>edington</strong>: I’m Inspector Edington of the Criminal
Investigation Department of Scotland Yard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>edington</strong>: As things are, there’s no need for you to
go through the Customs. Will you come this way!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>edington</strong>: This Way, please.</p>
<p><strong>edington</strong>: This is Mr. Woburn – Doctor and
Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now what do you people want with us?</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat with
you, inside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who is Mr. Buchanan?</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Special Branch, Scotland Yard.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: This is Mr. Buchanan – Doctor and
Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Thank you, Woburn.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Do sit down, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with
us?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Let me say at once, we’re shocked… that
you son was taken from you in Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about Hank? What have you heard?</p>
<p>****: I only wish I could give you some cheerful news.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: We might find him. Quite soon, indeed, if
we work together…Louis Bernard was sent to Marrakesh by the French at
our request to check up on an assassination plot – here, in London. A
good agent keeps on staking his life. He doesn’t always win.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust.
He relied on you, to come to us.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Those people kidnapped your boy – in order
to keep your mouth shut. That’s right, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think they took him for money.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Then why didn’t you go straight to your
Consulate in Casablanca? Why did you come to London?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Mr. Buchanan –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo…</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: You’re convinced that these people brought
your son to London. You’re convinced you can find him – off your own
bat. You can’t. It’s impossible. But with the help we can give you,
there’s a chance. A really good chance.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: They told us not to say anything!</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Anything you tell me will be in the most
absolute confidence.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That might be true, but –</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Your son is the trump card these people
hold. He’s perfectly safe – for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And when they’ve done what they’re going to do,
they’ll let him go. So all we have to do is wait.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider the boy
a nuisance, afterwards – I’m afraid –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now, don’t try to frighten us,
Mr. Buchanan.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: It’s exactly what I’m trying to do –
frighten you. I’m trying to prevent a man being murdered here, in
London.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: If you don’t tell me all you know, you
become an accessory before the fact of murder. In English law, you
become just short of murderers yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, what can we do by ourselves? We need –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr. Buchanan.
Louis Bernard talked to me, not my wife.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Then you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Bernard spoke in French, and I don’t understand
a word of the language.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: And what did you write down on a piece of
paper?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben – maybe they could find those people, and
Hank, before –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe. Maybe isn’t good enough for me, and it
shouldn’t be good enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You act as if you’re the only one who’s
concerned about Hank.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now Jo, I didn’t mean it that way. We made up
our minds what we were going to do – now let’s try to stick to it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’d like to cooperate with you, Mr. Buchanan –
but – but we just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: I have a son of my own. I don’t know what
I’d do…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, maybe if we –</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Put the call through here, please.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Mrs. McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hallo.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Mrs. McKenna?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: This is Mrs. Drayton. You remember
me?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Mrs…Drayton?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where’s Hank? Where have you got him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: He’s here. With me. You mustn’t worry
about him, really you mustn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where is he? Where have you got him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: I expect you’d like to speak to him,
wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes. Please, please!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hello. Hello, Hank?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Mummy? Mummy is that you?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Oh, Hank, Hank darling, are you really all
right?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I’m a little scared, mummy. But I’m all right
– I guess. I miss you mummy, I miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hank. This is daddy.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Is mummy crying?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are you, Hank? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I didn’t mean to make her cry, daddy, but I’m
scared, and I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hank, where are you? For Heaven’s sake, where
are you?!!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Welbeck eight –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He was scared.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: It was a London telephone exchange.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Public call box – West One.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do I have to say any more?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: You may change your minds. If you do, this
number will reach me.</p>
<p><strong>desk clark</strong>: Everything all right, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s fine. Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>desk clark</strong>: Your room key, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: And I hope you have a most pleasant stay
in London.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It’s from the Panell’s. “Welcome home, Jo. Look
forward to seeing your family. Especially the little–”</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Cindy and Jan. You don’t know Cindy and Jan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’d better keep your book.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The only clue we have which might lead us to
Hank. The place and identity of Mr. Ambrose Chappell.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Ben’s finger going down the column of names.
“C - C - CHAPPELL - ABRAHAM</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There it is – big as life – Ambrose
Chappell.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett Street.
Camden Town. Telephone - Gulliver 6198.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you want me to call him?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I can’t make up my mind, Ben. I’m jut scared to
death. I’m afraid we’ll do the wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll try not to be too wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What are you going to say?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll offer to keep my mouth shut and give him
all the money we have – for Hank. Operator. Get me … Gulliver 6198.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I go.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Jo! You look wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: When we got your wire I couldn’t believe it.
What were you doing down in Morocco?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sightseeing.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Two minutes later Helen was on the phone to
me. And I had to call Jan.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You’re the perfect answer to what London needs,
Jo. This week’s the dullest thing since my first show.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hello, Val. Jo and I want to thank all of you
for the lovely flowers. But you shouldn’t have. We might not be here
long!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell?
Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right…I will…I</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Oh hello, Mr. Conway. Didn’t know you were
there.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It’s McKenna…Doctor McKenna. Welcome to London
Town, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Oh, I am sorry. I knew you were married, but a
doctor. How clever! Especially in such a psychosomatic business. Why
–</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Will you be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Cindy!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You don’t know what psychosomatic means.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I do too! It means when your mind gets sick of
your body it does something to it –</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The doctor’s trying to talk on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s only business. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Business is everything. Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? I said is this
Ambrose Chappell? …Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,…Doctor Benjamin
McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: I don’t think we need to be quiet. Would you
like some drinks?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at your
address for a while? Uh huh, it’s just some business. Nothing big. Uh
huh, well thank you. I’ll drop around.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: See. We could have talked.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: That’s what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’d like everyone to meet my husband.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I’ve heard so much about you, Doctor, it’s nice
to see you in person.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You look just like, those pictures Jo had in
her dressing room four years ago. Haven’t changed a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Why should he? He’s a doctor. Probably gets
free hormones.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And this one is Jan Peterson who sing almost as
well as I do, but can handle those legs like Nijinsky.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can believe it. How do you do, Jan.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: When Nijinsky got off the stage he was through
with his footwork. That’s just when mine begins.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful
expatriate I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Haven’t you been home recently?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: How can I go back to Harrisburg? They know me
there as Elva MacDuff Cindy. It doesn’t fit any more.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Where’s your boy? I’d like to see which one you
he looks like.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He – he’s staying with some other people – so
we can have a little time to ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hank. Henry, really.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I hope he has your looks, and the doctor’s
brains.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you again for the beautiful flowers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m taking orders for drinks.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Okay. But dinner tonight’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Room service, please.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: A welcome home for Jo. And I wish I could
persuade her to stay a month.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Oh, Val – I wish I could, but…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you order the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll be back in a little while.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Aren’t you going to wait for a drink,
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, but I’ll catch up when I get
back.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Maybe he’s tired. Maybe he’d like to sleep, or
something. Maybe he has ulcers and can’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Ben, please …</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It has to be done, Jo.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: I Want to go with you.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Jan, how somebody so graceful can have such
an awkward sense of diplomacy, I’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You can’t. I won’t disappear. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, for the last time, please let me go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Two people are much easier to follow than one.
We don’t want Buchanan’s men on our tracks. Or the other people, either.
I’m going out by the service entrance –</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I…I’d like to speak to Mr. Ambrose Chappell,
please.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Come in .</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: A sent to see you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose
Chappell.</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well you see, I uh…</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: You gave me your name that might be a
start.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, of course, McKenna. Doctor Benjamin
McKenna, I called you.</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You are Ambrose Chappell?</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: I have been Ambrose Chappell for
nearby seventy-one years. But I think I understand your problem.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr</strong>: Certainly. It happens all the time. You
expected someone else – Just a moment. Ambrose!</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: I think this gentleman wants to talk
to us.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Now, father. Now why don’t you go and
have a nice rest?</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: Humph! I have centuries of rest ahead
of me.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Now what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m Doctor Mckenna. Does the name mean anything
to you?</p>
<p><strong>chappell</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You have no idea why I came here?</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: My dear sir, I haven’t the faintest
idea!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was given your name by someone I happened to
meet in Marrakesh.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Oh, yes?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I suppose you’ve heard of him. Louis Bernard. A
Frenchman.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Louis Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s stop fencing with words, huh? Bernard
told me to come here, just before he died.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: This man is…dead?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know it as well as I do. Now I came to make
a business proposition. And I don’t see how you can turn it down.</p>
<p><strong>chappeel jr.</strong>: What did you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You want to talk here?</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Certainly. We have no secrets from our
employees.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay. First of all, I haven’t uttered one word
of what Bernard told to before he died. And I won’t. Frankly I’m not
interested in political intrigue, and I don’t care who it is you’re
going to kill here in London. All I want is that boy, and I’ll get on
the first plane for America.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now that isn’t all. If money will do
anything…</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Father – phone the police! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Now, sir – shall we go into this a
little more carefully? You said something about money?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You told him to call the police. Now don’t try
to bluff me like that!</p>
<p><strong>chappell sr.</strong>: This is Ambrose Chappell’s – Burdett
Street. Will you send someone round at once? There’s is an extraordinary
individual here, and we really can’t cope with him.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t know Louis Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: I’ve never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you don’t have any idea what went on in
Marrakesh yesterday, or where my boy is?</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: No, of course not! Edgar! William!
Davis! Help!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now just a minute. Take it easy. I obviously
got the wrong place. Now stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>chappell jr.</strong>: Hold him…hold him…till the police
come.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: …and back at our flat, after the first night,
Chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where Bud Flanagan comes
in dressed up as the Countess was unconvincing … that no matter how
well-got-up Bud Flanagan was, even if he were dressed by Hartnell,
nobody would believe he was an aristocrat. So I said, ’Look Chris, why
don’t you cut William Hickey’s column out of the paper?! –</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Jo. Jo.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What’s become of that unpredictable husband of
yours? He’s been gone over an hour.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Who was it he went to see? Some man named…
…what was it…Church?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No. No…you mean Chappell!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It’s not a man, it’s a place! Ambrose Chapel!
Ambrose Chapel! It has to be!</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Do they list chapels in the London Telephone
Directory?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Let’s a take a look.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Here it is, Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street,
West Two.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: But have another drink – and please explain to
Ben when he comes in.</p>
<p><strong>val and helen</strong>: Explain what?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There’s something weird going on around here
that I can’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Let’s see if we can figure this out. First of
all there was a man named to uh…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ambrose Chapel.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: And Ben rushed off to see him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then Jo said it wasn’t a man, but a place and
she dashed off.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Don’t mention it again or I might dash off.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What a temptation.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Can you fathom it, Val?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It must be a now American gag. I’ll ask Danny
about it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’s Jo?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: She’s just gone off to Ambrose Chapel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But – but, that’s where I’ve been…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It isn’t your Ambrose Chapel!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It isn’t a he! It’s an it! A building.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: She’s just gone there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where is it! What’s the address?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: 17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Doctor! Doctor! It’s Jo! Come back – it’s
Jo.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jo?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben – Ben, darling…what happened – did you find
anything?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No – I drew a complete blank.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Then it must be the chapel - and I’ve found it,
Ben. It’s just a short way from here. It was a crazy thing to do –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have the address, Jo. Now stay there until I
get there…and don’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you stick around? We’ll be back as soon as
we can. I don’t know how to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Three men! You don’t know much about checkers,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: It’s time you went to bed, dear.
You’ll get tired out.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Can I finish? I’m winning?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he
gets some milk and biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: And he’d better have another sleeping
pill…I’ve got to get downstairs –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: You’ll go to sleep, Hank, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Hurry up if you want to finish this game.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Look it doesn’t hurt to be kind. Yell
out when you want me to open the door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: I wish it was tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: That’s not a very orthodox sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Two excellent tickets for the concert at
the Albert Hall – with my compliments.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say
strategically placed.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Now for the most important part.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: A record of the delightful Picco they will
play tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Music is less in your line than
marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the
exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Let me do it for you again. Now listen for
the cymbal crash.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: You see at such a moment your shot will not
be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer
would have appreciated that. No one will know.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: None except one you mean.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Ah, yes – if you are clever, my friend. Any
questions musical or otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: There’s’s one comforting thought. It
happens early in the evening. I hope I won’t upset you if I say there’s
time for one shot only. If you need another, the risk is yours.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: I do not take risks.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: That’s a comfort – traipsing all the way
down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Your distinguished target’s on the way
there now. A car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. You
will pick up a Miss Benson on your way. She will be your companion in
the box. She’s there to lend an air of respectability…if that’s
possible.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: You will have the money when I return?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I think you can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: What is your English proverb – a wolf in
Sheep’s clothing?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I think you had better be going. It is
impolite to be late for a concert. It would be awkward if they made you
wait until the first selection is over.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: See him downstairs, my dear. I’m sorry you
must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable
front.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You may have just hit it right on the nose. You
can’t be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, should we get some help from the
police?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, honey, please, no – let’s take a crack at
this alone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This looks like mother wild goose chase.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Let’s wait and look around…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look who’s coming down the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Brothers and Sisters: The subject of my
address this evening is adversity. The average life, yours and mine, is
often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our
control.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s Buchanan’s phone number. Go on out and
call him and ask him to surround the place with police.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What if he asks me…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell him…tell him everything. This is the time.
I’m sure Hank is around here some place.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Ben, I don’t want to leave you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know how else to do it, honey.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Few of us pause to think how life’s
adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: But I believe we should pause now to do a
little stock-taking – to look into our own hearts and see what we find
there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should
all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little
we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I
shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon
each and every one of you.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Well this is a pleasant surprise,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’s my boy, Drayton?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: He’s upstairs. As a matter of fact you’ve
just come in time to help my wife with Hank’s food. Seems Hank doesn’t
care much for English cooking.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you want? I’ll give you money and keep
my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: And what about your wife? Did she go
outside just to get some fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me what you want. I’ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: All right – you’ll see your boy in good
time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hank! Hank McKenna! Hank! Where are you? Hank!
Hank!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Daddy! Daddy, I’m here! Dad -</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: …And Ben is in there now, watching the both of
them!</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: He sent me out to call you – so we could do
something before they get away.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: I see, Mrs. McKenna – and you believe your
son is somewhere in the chapel?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t know where he is…but at
least these people will know – the Draytons. If you’d only send somebody
to get them.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: I’m afraid it isn’t quite as easy as all
that.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Mr. Woburn, there isn’t any time! My husband is
sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can’t I talk
with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: I’m awfully sorry, but I simply can’t get
hold of him just now. He’s gone to a rather important diplomatic affair
– at the Albert Hall.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well call him there, please! Call him!</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: He’s on his way. I don’t know quite –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Then can’t you do anything – right away – before
we lose the Draytons?</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: I assure you, I’ll do all I cant as soon as
I can.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We don’t have days to do this. It’s a matter of
minutes. Can’t you send the police. Or do I have to go to the Albert
Hall myself.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: That won’t be necessary. I’ll see that the
chapel is put under immediate observation. By the time you get back a
police car should be there. Please return to your husband, tell him to
come straight out of the chapel, and let the police take over.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Woburn, Special Branch, hold on. I must ring
off now, Mrs. McKenna. Please believe me, I’ll have everything laid
on.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: There’s nobody there!</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Are you Mrs. McKenna?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, but something’s wrong. A few minutes ago
the place was full of people, and now there’s nobody!</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Our orders are to keep it under
observation until a Scotland Yard car arrives.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: My husband’s in there. There must have been
thirty or forty people… and now…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It couldn’t…it couldn’t have been more than five
minutes ago!</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I tried that. It’s looked, Let’s force it
open.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’m sorry, madam, we can’t break in.
Requires a search warrant. It’s the law, you see.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Couldn’t you get one?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It all takes time. We’ll have a look
round, shall we? Matthews, you take the other end.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: There’s no one there, sir.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Are you quite certain the place was full
of people – only a few minutes ago?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Of course I’m certain. I was there myself,
sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: It’s much too complicated to explain.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: We’ll just have to sit tight and wait for
the car to arrive from the Yard.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: So far as we can make out, sir, there’s
no sign of life. I see, very good, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Walden, you’ll stay here, till the car
arrives from the Yard.</p>
<p><strong>walden</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: That’s all, Matthews.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re not leaving?</p>
<p><strong>patterso</strong>: Orders, madam. Can we give you lift
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Afraid the Albert Hall’s a bit off our
beat. Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All right. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Everybody out into the corridor. Hurry</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Do what he says. Come on. It will only be a
minute. Come on, all of you – out.</p>
<p><strong>woman cook</strong>: This embassy – there’s always something
queer going on.</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Bringing people in, in secret…</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Give me the Swiss Embassy every time,
there’s neutrality for you!</p>
<p><strong>uniformed attendant</strong>: Seats at a guinea. Starting
Room three and six –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I would like to see the manager, please.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed attendant</strong>: I’m sorry, madam, The manager’s
on duty in the lobby. So’s his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Please, I must speak to one of them. Which are
they?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed attendant</strong>: Over there somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>1st girl</strong>: Is that the Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>2nd girl</strong>: No, that’s only the Ambassador. The Prime
Minister’s the one with the bald head.</p>
<p><strong>1st girl</strong>: Well, I’ll guarantee he’s got a better
seat than we have.</p>
<p><strong>rien</strong>: You have a very nice little boy, madame.</p>
<p><strong>j0</strong>: Where Is he? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>ticket collector</strong>: Your ticket, madam?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: If you don’t mind, I’m just looking for
someone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then he didn’t kill him?</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: Your wife saved him – it is only
a small flesh wound…Oh here he is now…you must come and meet him…don’t
be nervous…I’ll get the aide to present you…it will be all right Would
you present the lady to the prime minister?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: I’ll report to you fully at the Embassy,
Your Excellency. In the meantime…</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady who
–</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: My dear lady, I shall be for ever in
your debt.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: And this is her husband –</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: A pleasure, my dear sir… I trust you
will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my
gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It wasn’t – it wasn’t –</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Oh but it was, my dear lady.</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: I think Mr. Buchanan would like to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where’s our boy? Where’s Hank?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: We can talk if you’ll come in here.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: So you both know the time and place all
along.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t be a fool.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: An odd coincidence – both of you turning
up here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Too bad you didn’t contact your assistant. He
sent us both here.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You see, we finally needed that help you
offered. We still need it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, Mr. Buchanan. We still need it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We’ve questioned the woman. Said she
bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man
that did the shooting. Doesn’t know anything – but if she does, she’s
not talking.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: I’ll see her later.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Please tell me everything, now.
Everything. There’s still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna…</p>
<p><strong>footman</strong>: His Excellency will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Yes…yes…I see. Well if the woman won’t
talk, she won’t talk and that’s that, I suppose. All right.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to
you – something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to
pay our French marksman.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Wouldn’t it be superfluous, considering
that he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: His aim wasn’t quite as good as you led
me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the
arm. Worse than useless.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Then your French friend panicked, and
made a fatal crash – landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I don’t see how you can hold me
responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in
Marrakesh…</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: I’m glad you’re able to treat the matter
so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few
minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor –
when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That
amuses you, no doubt?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I don’t know what to say …</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: No. But I do. You’ve muddled everything
from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh…Don’t you realize
that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: How else could I make sure the American
would hold his tongue?</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: And then, to crown it all, you get cold
feet and come running along here to hide – and bring the child with you:
Don’t you see what you’ve done to the diplomatic status of this
Embassy?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I didn’t think…I only thought…</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: How are you going to get the child out
of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: There’s no difficulty about that, surely?
The car –</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: With plain-clothes detectives planted
right round this building? You English intellectuals will be the death
of us all.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I’ll think of some method. Just give me
time….</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Time!</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: I want the child removed from this
Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won’t be able to say any more
where he has been tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Right, I’ll see to it..</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Your Excellency, the Princess should be
arriving at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: …recognized him, and he recognized me. So he
jumped for it. And that is all.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Trying to liquidate one of their own
big-shots. I wish they’d stick to their usual custom, and do it in their
own country…</p>
<p><strong>woburn</strong>: Hello. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Buchanan speaking.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Right. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: The Draytons are at the Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: We have ways of finding out – from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to
be there too!</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: You’re probably right. But we can do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: Every Embassy in a foreign country has
extra-territorial rights.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What does that mean in common language?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: As far as we’re concerned, this Embassy
stands on foreign soil.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Does that mean they can steal children and get
away with it?</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: We could have the Foreign Office serve a
writ on the Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: …You know, I’m not responsible for the
complications of International Law…</p>
<p><strong>buchanan</strong>: …If only we had positive proof that the
boy really is in there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s the telephone number of this
Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>wonburn</strong>: Grosvenor 0144.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What are you thinking about, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Grosvenor 0144.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going to speak to the Minister himself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: May I speak to the Prime Minister, please?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell him the lady who saved his life wants to
speak to him. Its important.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What am I supposed to say, Ben? I don’t know –
Ben, half looking at Woburn and Buchanan, gives her instructions.</p>
<p><strong>bfn</strong>: He said he wanted to visit us soon so he could
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bfn</strong>: Well, tell him we’d like to see him tonight, at
the Embassy, because we have to leave London tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: My dear lady…This is a charming
surprise…</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Delighted, delighted, delighted. The
Ambassador, too, will be delighted. Any friends of mine are friends of
his. We will drink a little toast to your country and to mine.
Peacefully we will co-exist…Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He said – all right.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Good even. Would you come this way, please?
The Prime Minister is waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Good evening, good evening!</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: This is the charming lady who saved
my life at the Concert!</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Madame, you saved the life of the one
man, who is irreplaceable in our Country.</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: They tell me you are the famous Jo
Conway, Madame?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes. I’m Jo Conway.</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Do you think perhaps Madame might be
persuaded to sing?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sure she would be glad to… wouldn’t you
dear?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well, I don’t know. It’s been some time…</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda
to conclude a dramatic evening!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: All right. I’m very flattered.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Stanis would you put up some chairs
quickly. Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight…Jo Conway…the
famous Jo Conway…she has graciously consented to sing for us .. Darling
would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Would you like to sit down, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No…I’ll just stand over here.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: That’s my Mother’s voice! That’s my Mother
singing!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Hank – are you sure? Are you really
sure?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: That’s her! I know it!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: What is she doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: Hank? – can you whistle that song?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs drayton</strong>: Then go on – whistle it. Whistle it as
loud as you can.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: You two wait in the mail room. I’ll bring
him down.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I won’t be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t think you want to start any shooting,
Drayton – with all those people downstairs, and police outside.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. drayton</strong>: You’ve got to let the boy go!</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Precisely my own notion, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: I’m sure you’ll ba sensible, and help me
out of here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t ask me for help, you miserable….</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: You wouldn’t want your father to get hurt,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: We’ll go down the stairs together in a
casual sort of way. Then we’ll stroll along to the nearest taxi rank. I
trust there won’t be any emotional outbursts…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There won’t be. Hank – don’t say or do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>drayton</strong>: Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Mummy.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hank.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry we were gone so long, Val, but we had
to go and pick up Hank.</p>
