<p><strong>adaptation</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My toenails
have turned strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive? I don’t know for I
suffer from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but
am I as fat as I think? My therapist says no, but people lie. I believe
others call me Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or, facetiously, Slim.
But I also believe this is simply my own perverted form of
self-aggrandizement, that no one really talks about me at all. What
possible interest is an old, bald, fat man to anyone? I am repulsive. I
have never lived. I blame myself. I –</p>
<p><strong>british narrator</strong>: As natural selection works solely
by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.</p>
<p><strong>british narrator</strong>: It is interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds
singing…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Laroche is asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Crazy White Man is now Drowsy White Man.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a
stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome despite the
fact that he is missing all his front teeth.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Two years ago I went to Florida to meet
Laroche after reading a small article about a white man and three
Seminole men arrested with rare orchids they’d stolen out of a place
called the…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the swamp.
I’m on Janes Scenic Drive just east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat,
Indians in the swamp.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: I don’t know what you want me to
say.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks. If
there are Indians in the swamp, they are in there for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m old. I’m bald. I’m repulsive.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We think you’re just great.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And we’re thrilled you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh, thanks, wow. That’s nice to hear.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You have a really unique voice.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, thanks. That’s… I appreciate
that.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Very talented. Really.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Sort of hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Yeah, it is a bit. So, why don’t you tell
me your thoughts on this crazy little project of ours.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: First, I think it’s a great book.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Laroche is a fun character, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating.
Plus her musings on Florida, orchid poaching. Indians. Great, sprawling
New Yorker stuff. I’d want to remain true to that, let the movie exist
rather than be artificially plot driven.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Okay, great, great. I guess I’m not exactly
sure what that means.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh. Well… I’m not sure exactly yet either.
So… y’know, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Oh. Okay. Great. So, um, what –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s just, I don’t want to compromise by
making it a Hollywood product. An orchid heist movie. Or changing the
orchids into poppies and turning it into a movie about drug running.
Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Oh, of course. We agree. Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Or cramming in sex, or car chases, or guns.
Or characters learning profound life lessons. Or characters growing or
characters changing or characters learning to like each other or
characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. Y’know? Movie
shit.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: See, we thought maybe Susan Orlean and
Laroche could fall in love during the course of –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Alienated journalist writes about
passionate backwoods guy and he teaches her to love. I mean, it didn’t
happen, it wouldn’t happen. It’s Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: So anyway I just wanted to stop by to
congratulate you on your promotion.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, thanks again. It’s all so
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I think it’s great. Your photo in the
trades and everything. Pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Anyway. Yeah. So what’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m considering jobs. Mostly crap. There’s
one you might like, about flowers.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Flowers? Really? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: They want me to do an adaptation of a book
called The Orchid Thief.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh my God! You’re kidding? I read that! I
loved that book!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I loved the book.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, Charlie, orchids are the most amazing
flowers. So complex.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I know. They’re really great.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You should take this job. Doesn’t it sound
exciting, to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything
about it? Blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower. And after
you learn all this stuff, you can teach me!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’d be fun.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: God, they’re such beautiful flowers. And
so sexy. Y’know? Did you know that orchid means –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Testicle. I just read that.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Testicle! Can you believe it!</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know
you fellas believe the world rests on the back of a turtle? Not you
fellas specifically. Although, maybe you fellas specifically. That I
can’t speak to.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: …plus I love the idea of learning all about
orchids. I really admire those guys who know everything about ants or
fungus or whatever. I’d like to be more like that. See, I tend to write
self- involved, self-loathing… even masturbatory stuff.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And it’s wonderful, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thanks. That’s nice to hear. But I need to
challenge myself as a writer. I’ve arrived at an age where I want to
think about the world in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Adapting someone else’s work is certainly
an opportunity to think differently.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes. And I welcome the challenge of taking
a small subject, like orchids, something that would never draw people
into a theater and making that fascinating. I want to show people heaven
in a wildflower. As Blake wrote.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Any one at all, ma?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: A wonderful choice! And spiritually
significant! Did you know that Native Americans believe the whole world
rests on the back of a turtle?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Cool! I can’t wait to tell the guys.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: To a fucking awesome assignment, man.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hey, I’m going to an orchid show Sunday?
For research? Maybe you’ll come?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Absolutely. I think David, this guy I’m
seeing, would enjoy it, too. He’s a real naturalist. Okay if he comes
along?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah, of course. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He wants to meet you anyway. All I do is
tell him how great you are.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh, thanks. That’s nice to hear.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ll like him. He’s so honest and smart.
It’s rare to find someone in this town who thinks about things other
than this fucking business, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. That’s great. He sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Like the other day we were in bed
discussing Hegel. Hegel! In bed! It was fucking amazing. Have you read
much?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Y’know, a long time ago. A bit. Y’know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, anyway, David and I were discussing
his Philosophy of History and I was…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: … that nature doesn’t exist historically,
but rather cyclically.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MARGARET</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: How’s that Injun round-up going,
Tony?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Fuck you, Barry, you fuckin’…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The Victorian-era orchid hunter William
Arnold drowned on a collecting expedition.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Schroeder fell to his death.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Endres was shot dead in Rio Hacha.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy, and dysentery…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen have in
those pillowcases?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yes, sir, you absolutely may.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Okay, I’m asking then.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Oh, Okay then! Let’s see… Five kinds of
bromeliad, one peperomia, nine orchid varieties. About a hundred and
thirty plants all told, which my colleagues have removed from the
swamp.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You’re aware that it’s illegal to remove
plants or animals from state owned land?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: And don’t forget these plants are all
endangered, sir. Every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Exactly. Well, that’s exactly the issue. This
is a state preserve.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yes, sir, it is. Oh, and my colleagues are
all Seminole Indians. Did I mention that? You’re familiar, I’m sure,
with the State of Florida v. James E. Billie.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Not to mention the failed attempts on three
separate occasions to prosecute Seminoles for poaching palm fronds,
which, I believe, they use to thatch the roofs of their traditional
chickee huts.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: He’s right. That’s exactly what we use them
for. Chickee huts.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vinson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t… I can’t let you fellas go
yet. Just hold on while I… Hey, Barry, can I get some help? Barry?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Nothing in Florida seems hard or permanent.
The developed places are just little clearings in the jungle, but the
jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything is always growing or
expanding. At the same time, the wilderness disappears before your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am fat. I am repulsive. I cannot bear my
own reflection.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Did you open your present from mom yet?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What’s with you?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: My back.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’m gonna be a screenwriter! Like you!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It’s only five hundred bucks!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: In theory I agree with you. But this one is
highly regarded within the industry.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald, don’t say “industry.”</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’m sorry, I forgot. Charles, this guy knows
screenwriting. People from all over come to study his method. I’ll pay
you back, man. As soon as I sell –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Let me explain something to you.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Anybody who says he’s got “the answer” is
going to attract desperate people. Be it in the world of religion –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I just need to lie down while you explain
this to me. Sorry. I apologize. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Okay. Go.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There are no rules to follow, Donald, and
anybody who says there are, is just –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Not rules, principles. McKee writes: “A rule
says, you must do it this way. A principle says, this works… and has
through all remembered time.”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The script I’m starting, it’s about
flowers. No one’s ever done a movie about flowers before. So, there’re
no guidelines, and that’s good because –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: What about Flowers for Algernon?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s not about flowers. And it’s not a
movie.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh, okay, I never saw it. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: My point is, those teachers are dangerous
if your goal is to do something new. And a writer should always have
that goal. Writing is a journey into the unknown. It’s not building a
model airplane.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Each being is, because posited, an op-
posited, a conditional and conditioning, the Understanding completes
these its limitations by positing the opposite…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: McKee is a former Fulbright scholar. Are you
a former Fulbright scholar, Charles?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Turtles are of the order Testudine!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Really? Testudine?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah. And they’re found on every continent!
Except Antarptica!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Antarctica. Every continent, huh?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Uh-huh. The turtle shell has remained unchanged
for two hundred million years! And there’s all different kinds, Pelusio
gabonensis, Phyrnops rufipes, Chitra indica, Dermochelys coriacea
coriacea…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: … and what we have here, my friend, is …
thirteen Encyclia Cochleata… four Encyclia Tampensis –</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: I’m sorry, Encyclia what?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis. Okay, let’s see,
twenty-two Epidendrum Nocturnum. A very good haul. Two Catopsi
Floribunda. Three Polyrrhiza Lindenii, the ghost orchid. What I really
came for. These sweeties grow nowhere in the U.S. except in your
swamp.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: That true? Boy, you really know your
plants, Mr. Laroche.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah. I do. I’m one of the world’s foremost
experts. But that’ll all be revealed at the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient family
of perennial plants with…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: The most memorable, fascinating characters
tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire. Although
these characters are unaware of their subconscious need…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Maybe you should watch what you eat,
Donald. Did you ever consider maybe you’re a bit fat? Does it ever occur
to you, you kind of represent me in the world? That people look at you
and think, he’s Charlie’s twin, therefore that’s what Charlie must look
like?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: By the way, mom’s paying for the
seminar.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Did you even hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Yeah. Anyway. I pitched mom my screenplay
–</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Jesus, don’t say “pitch.”</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Sorry. Anyway, she loved my… telling of my
story to her. She said it’s like “Silence of the Lambs” meets
“Psycho.”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate. I
hear she’s really good with structure.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You think you’re so superior, Charles. Well,
I’m really gonna write this. And you’ll see. And, and… you suck,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Florida is a landscape of transition…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Do not proliferate characters; do not
multiply locations. Rather than hopscotching through time, space, and
people, discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and
world…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Florida is a landscape of transition and
mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and orderliness, nature and
artifice.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We open on State Road 29. A lonely stretch
of road cutting through untamed swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van
barrels around a curve. It’s driver: a skinny man with no front
teeth…</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Finally, Mr. Laroche, what is your
experience in the area of horticulture?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Okay, I’ve been a professional
horticulturist for twelve years. I’ve owned a plant nursery of my own
which was destroyed by the hurricane. I’m a professional plant lecturer.
I’ve given at least sixty lectures on the cultivation of plants. I’m a
published author, both in magazine and book form. I have extensive
experience with orchids, and the asexual micropropagation of orchids
under aseptic cultures. This is laboratory work, not at all like your
nursery work. I’m probably the smartest person I know.</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: You’re very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Go away. God damn it.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Y’know, I’m just trying to do something.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, thanks a lot, man. Cool. Okay, there’s
this serial killer, right –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: No, wait. See, he’s being hunted by a cop.
And he’s taunting the cop, right? Sending clues who his next victim is.
He’s already holding her hostage in his creepy basement. So the cop gets
obsessed with figuring out her identity, and in the process he falls in
love with her. Even though he’s never even met her. She becomes, like,
the unattainable, like the Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s a little obvious, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Okay, but there’s a twist. See, we find out
the killer suffers from multiple personality disorder. Okay? See, he’s
really also the cop and the girl. All of them. It’s all him! Isn’t that
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Look, the only idea more overused than
serial killers, is multiple personality. On top of that you explore the
notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person.
See every cop movie ever made for other examples of this.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Mom called it psychologically taut.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The other thing is, there’s no way to write
this. Did you consider that? I mean, how exactly would you show a
character holding himself hostage?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Trick photography?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, that’s not what I’m asking. What I’m
asking is in the reality of this movie, if there’s only one character,
right?… Okay? How could you… What exactly would the scene… How…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: They’re gonna fucking crucify me.</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: I’ll go into the Fakahatchee with a
chainsaw. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Buster, for crying out loud, I reminded her
the Indians used to own Fakahatchee. Look, we’ll deal with all this at
trial.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Mr. Laroche?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: My name’s Susan Orlean, I’m a writer for the
New Yorker. It’s a maga –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’m familiar with the New Yorker. The New
Yorker, yes, the New Yorker. Right?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Right. So I was interested in doing a piece
about your situation down here.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah? Put this in: I don’t care what goes
on here. I’m right, and I’ll take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
That judge can screw herself.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: lush, profound orchestral piece.</p>
<p><strong>sensuous female narrator</strong>: The Orchidaceae is a
large, ancient family of perennial plants with one fertile stamen and a
three petalled flower. In most orchid species, one petal is enlarged
into a lip and is the most conspicuous part of the flower.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So what looks good today?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Um. Hi. Thank you. The key lime pie,
please. A small slice. I’m watching my… And a coffee, please. Skim
milk.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Orchids! I absolutely love orchids.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes. They’re really great.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So, I’ll be right back with your pie.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I absolutely love orchids.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: A few days after the hearing, Laroche took
me to an orchid show in Miami.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I want you to know this van is a piece of
shit. When I hit the jackpot, I’ll buy myself an awesome car, maybe an
Aurora.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: The thing you gotta know is my whole life
is looking for a goddamn profitable plant. And that’s the ghost.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Why the ghost orchid?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: The sucker’s rare. Collectors covet what is
not available. I’m the only one in the world who knows how to cultivate
it.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Men from Florida dominated the orchid
hunting scene. Hunters in the Fakahatchee hauled out thousands of
orchids in horse-drawn flatbed carts.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: A beautiful orange orchid blooms in time-
lapse –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What do you want, Donald?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Nothing. I just read about that Swamp Ape
that supposedly lives in the swamp? Like bigfoot? You should put that in
your script, like, killing people or something. That’d be very, very
cool.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Why are you in here now?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Nothing, I was just… Oh, one thing, I need a
cool way to kill people. Don’t worry! For my script! Ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Um, okay, killer’s a literature professor
who cuts off little chunks of his victims’ bodies until they die. He’d
be known in the tabloids as “The Deconstructionist.”</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: That’s kinda good. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: See, I was kidding, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh, okay. Sorry. You got me! Heh-heh. Do you
mind if I use it, though?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: For certain is death for the born/And
certain is birth for the dead/Therefore over the inevitable/Thou
shouldst not grieve. Sweet, sweet Diane.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: A slice of pie for my turtle expert?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Mom, there’s something I feel I have to do. I
don’t know how to do this, but I feel in my stomach that I have to.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What do you have to do, honey?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Collect one of every turtle in the world. It’s
a long list, ma. Cuora galbinifrons, Graptemys versa, Callagur
borneoensis, all the Galapagos species, people think there’s only one,
but that’s hardly the case. Cycloderma frenatum, Cuora pani… I don’t
think my life is worth living if I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, we’d better get started, huh,
baby?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Wow, that’s some story. So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Oh, I lost interest right after that.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I dropped turtles when I fell in love with
Ice Age fossils. Learned everything about them. Collected the shit out
of ’em. Fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking
world. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Then fossils were over when I found
lapidary, which I just adored.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Okay, now what is lap –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Ditched lapidary for resilvering old
mirrors. Did that with my mom for a while. We had the largest collection
of 19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet. Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World October ’88? I have a copy somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So, did you ever miss the turtles? The only
thing that made you ten year old life worth living?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’ll tell you a story. I once fell deeply,
profoundly in love with tropical fish. I had sixty goddamn fish tanks in
my house. I’d skin-dive to find just the right ones. Anisotremus
virginicus, Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus. You name it.
Then one day I say, fuck fish. I renounce fish.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAROCHE</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Done with fish.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: So –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m still obsessed with that girl.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: The Burger King girl? Dimples and sparkly
eyes?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: California Pizza Kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Oh. Red hair and nice? Likes orchids?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. She’s really nice. I feel pretty
certain she likes me maybe.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: So do you think you’ll talk to this
one?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hey! Some key lime pie for ya today?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, yeah! That sounds great! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll pick you out an extra large piece.
Preferred customer.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thank you. That’s really sweet of you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Still reading about orchids, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes, I am, in fact! Beautiful flowers.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: A friend of mine has a pretty little pink
one, grows right on a tree branch.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s what’s called an epiphyte.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Right! Boy, you know your stuff, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Not really. I’m just learning. Epiphytes
grow on trees, but they’re not parasites. They get all their nourishment
from the air and rain.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, I’m impressed. That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There are more than thirty thousand kinds
of orchids in the world.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Wow, that’s a lot, huh? Okay, then, so I’ll
be right back with a nice big slice of key lime pie for my orchid
expert.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: But, so, anyway, I was also wondering…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh, um, well –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m sorry. I apologize. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So I’ll be right back with your pie then.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am fat. I am old. I am repulsive.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: There are more than thirty thousand known
orchid species. One species looks like a German shepherd…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: … one looks like an onion, one looks like an
octopus. One looks…</p>
<p><strong>teenaged laroche</strong>: Encyclia tempensis. The
butterfly.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: “You will find something more in woods than
in books. Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn
from masters.” Saint Bernard said that.</p>
<p><strong>teenaged laroche</strong>: That’s pretty, ma.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Diane would’ve loved this flower,
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>teenaged laroche</strong>: Maybe somehow she can see it.
Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So… after this one how many, honey?</p>
<p><strong>teenaged laroche</strong>: Only one hundred and seventeen
more.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And you have to have a photo of every single
type of orchid in Florida?</p>
<p><strong>teenaged laroche</strong>: I have to, ma. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m successful, right? I mean, I could say
to a woman, I’m a screenwriter and she’d look at me differently. I could
get laid. But I want someone to like me. For me. Y’know? The way I like
them. The way I’d do anything for that woman walking down the street. A
million women walking down the street. I don’t need to know what their
jobs are. No one will ever love me like that. Like I love almost every
woman I see.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Once you get the sickness, it takes over
your life. I started out just photographing ’em. Now look at me. It’ll
happen to you. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I don’t think so. I’m not prone to –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Angraecum sesquipedale! Beauty! God! Darwin
wrote about this one. Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I know who Darwin is.</p>
<p><strong>darwin</strong>: Therefore I should infer from analogy that
probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have
descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first
breathed.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, opening of movie. Four billion years
ago. Life has not begun. Endless, barren terrain. Silence. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: See that nectary all the way down there?
Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate
it. Everyone thought he was a loon. Then, sure enough, they found this
moth with a twelve inch proboscis – proboscis means nose, by the way –
and –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I know what proboscis means.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Every one of these flowers has a specific
relationship with the insect that pollinates it. There’s an orchid that
looks exactly like this particular insect. So the bug humps the flower
and gets covered with its pollen. Thusly…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I get it.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: That’s called pseudo-copulation. These
flowers are smart! You gotta fall in love with them. Once you learn
anything about orchids, you’ll devote your life to learning everything
about them.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I wanted to want something as much as people
wanted these plants but it isn’t part of my constitution.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: … then, after the entire history of life on
the planet, in the last seconds of the montage, we see the whole of
human history: tool-making, hunting, farming, war, lust, religion,
self-consciousness. Yearning. Then, bam! cut to Susan Orlean writing a
book about orchids. And the story begins. It’s perfect! It’s circular!
It’s everything!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m an idiot. I’m fat. I hate my–</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: McKee is a genius! And hilarious! He just
comes up with these great jokes, and everyone laughs! But he’s serious,
too. You’d love him. He’s all for originality, just like you! But he
says, we have to realize we all write in a genre, so we must find
originality within that genre. See, it turns out there hasn’t been a new
genre since Fellini invented the mockumentary!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You and I share the same DNA. Is there
anything more lonely than that?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: You want to do something tonight?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I should work. I’ve got stuff…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Laroche is an optimist. That is, he sees a
profitable outcome in every situation. When he was a young man he worked
in construction.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Asclepiadaceae. From thirty yards. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: … I broke my back. Exactly how my dad did.
Isn’t that a psycho coincidence? Y’know, the way I see it, we’re a
family of ailments and pain. But, anyway, it was a godsend.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Laroche once spilled toxic pesticide into a
cut on his hand. It resulted in permanent heart and liver damage. Most
people would consider this a terrible accident. Laroche considered it a
success…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: … because he sold an article about it.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I consider the broken back – in three
places, by the way. I have x-rays – – a stroke of goddamn luck. I got
disability, married the sweetest woman in the world. And me and my
lovely new wife – my now ex-wife, the bitch – got to open our
nursery.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Movie opens with Susan Orlean typing. “John
Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick… Movie opens with a young boy
picking out his first pet… Movie opens with…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: People started coming out of the woodwork,
to ask me stuff, to admire my plants, to admire me.</p>
<p><strong>customer #1</strong>: John, what is this? It’s so
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Catasetum tenebrosum. From Peru. It’s neat
’cause its dimorphic, which means…</p>
<p><strong>customer #2</strong>: Johnny baby!</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Henry! Look at that Dracula vampira! It’s
gorgeous, man.</p>
<p><strong>customer #2</strong>: Take me in to the Fakahatchee. Show me
a ghost in bloom, and it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>customer #3</strong>: Mr. Laroche, would you be able to –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Bromeliad Tree. Hey, Dora! Good, good.
Well, sure, you gotta watch the temperature. Don’t want an odontoglossum
above seventy-five. Uh-huh, that should be fine. Yeah, damp it down. Oh,
I’m doing well. She’s fine, too. Sure…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I believe some folks’d call me up to talk
and just talk because they were lonely.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know how to adapt this. I should’ve
just stuck with my own stuff. I don’t know why I thought I could –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: See her? I fucked her up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just kidding. Hey, maybe I can help. What’s
the problem, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s about flowers.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s not only about flowers. It’s got that
crazy plant nut guy. He’s funny, right?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: “There is not nearly enough of him to fill
a book,” blah blah blah, so Orlean “digresses in long passes” blah blah
blah “no narrative really unites these passages.” Blah blah blah blah
blah.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: KAUFMAN</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh man. I’d fuck her up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There’s no story. The book has no
story.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So make one up. The book’s a jumping off
point. No one in town can make up a crazy story like you. You’re the
king.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I didn’t want to do that this time. It’s
someone else’s material. I have a responsibility… Anyway, I wanted to
grow as a writer, do something profound and simple. Show people how
amazing flowers are.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Are they amazing?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know. I think they are.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Look, what I tell a lot of guys is pick
another film and use it as a model. I always thought this one could be
like Apocalypse Now. The journalist spends the whole movie searching for
the crazy plant nut guy – what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: John Laroche.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She has to travel deep into the darkest
swamps to find the mysterious “Laroche.”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I need you to get me out of this.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Charlie, at the end of the day, I think it
would be a terrible career move.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, okay, we open with Laroche. He’s
funny. Okay, he says, okay, he says, I love to mutate plants, he says,
mutation is fun… Okay, we show flowers and, okay, we have to have the
court case. Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, I was mutated as baby,
that’s why I’m so smart…that’s funny. Okay we open at the beginning of
time…no, okay, we open with Laroche driving into the swamp…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The pioneer-adventurers in Florida had to
travel inward, into a place as dark and dense as steel wool. They had to
confront what a dark, dense, overabundant place might have hidden in
it.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: The nursery was going well, but sometimes
bad things happen. Darkness descends.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Sure you don’t want to come, dad?</p>
<p><strong>uncle jim</strong>: Nursery business good, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Everything’s good, Uncle Jim. This last
year’s been a dream, I’m telling you. We’re finally pulling out of this
debt.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Amen, honey. Praise Allah, Buddha, Vishnu.
And all the rest of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: She divorced me soon after she regained
consciousness. Then the hurricane destroyed my greenhouse. Everything. I
knew it would break my heart to start another nursery, so when the
Seminoles wanted a white guy, an expert, to get their nursery going, I
took it.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: But I wasn’t gonna give them a conventional
little potted-plant place. So I came up with the “ghost” plan. I was
gonna give them something amazing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: … see, Laroche researched it and found that
Indians have the legal right to take endangered plants off state
lands.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What an amazing opening! So then it’s a
courtroom drama. A Few Good Men! And all those Indian rights issues are
so complex. There are valid arguments on both sides. I mean we took
their land! We gave them smallpox!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, actually, there wasn’t much of a
trial. Florida got ’em on a technicality, about cutting down non-
endangered trees. Even the Indians aren’t allowed to do that. They all
plead no contest. Laroche got fined five hundred bucks and banned from
the Fakahatchee for six months.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, wow. So, like, then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Nothing much. That’s what I like. I mean,
most people’s lives don’t include a lot of drama and I wanted to sort of
be compelling without having to resort to big, um… Y’know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Absolutely. I absolutely do.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s, like, Blake talked about seeing the
world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower. Y’know? Or like
Hegel?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am a failure. I’m a poseur. I have no
ideas. I wanted to do something great. There’s no story. I’m fat. I’m
repuls–</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Charlie? It’s Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh, hi. Hi. Hey! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sorry to bug you. We were just talking
about you, how excited we are.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So it’s coming along good?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s good. It’s complicated what I’m trying
to do, but it’s going very well.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Hello, John? It’s Susan.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Susie-Q!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So I was thinking it’d be good for the
article for me to go into the Fakahatchee to see a ghost. Would you take
me?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’d love to, but, hey, I’m banned for the
next six months. Goddamn crucified me. Get one of them monkey-suited
rangers to take you. ’Course, they wouldn’t be able to locate a ghost,
if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass. Hey, put that
in the article.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald, is
a perfect metaphor for writing. I’m stepping into the confusion of the
unknown. I’m taking the big risk here.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s dark, dangerous, as dense as steel
wool. I don’t know if I’ll come out alive, but if I do, I’ll have
something true to give the world. That’s the difference between writing
and aping some moron’s “principles.”</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, Charles, I’m thinking of putting a song
in. Y’know like when characters sing pop songs in their pajamas and
dance around. I thought it might be a nice way to break the tension. So,
try to think of a song about split personality…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: You would have to want something very
badly…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: … to go looking for it in the Fakahatchee
Strand.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hey! How was Denver?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Oh, God, sweetie, I’m so glad to be
home.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: An early surveyor made this entry in his
field notes…</p>
<p><strong>surveyor</strong>: A pond surrounded by bay and cypress
swamp, impracticable. Full of monstrous alligators, counted fifty and
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Whatever isn’t wet in the Fakahatchee is
blasted. The grass gets so dry that the friction from a car can set it
on fire, and the burning grass can engulf the car in flames. A 1940’s
botanist noted:</p>
<p><strong>botanist</strong>: Most impressed by the area’s variety of
squirrels…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The swamp’s darkness and denseness can
rattle your nerves. A sailor on a pluma- collecting expedition wrote in
his diary:</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: The place looked wild and lonely. About
three o’clock it seemed to get on Henry’s nerves. We saw him crying, he
could not tell us why, he was just plain scared.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The swampy part of the Fakahatchee is hot
and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth snakes and diamond back
rattlers and…</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: … alligators and snapping turtles and
poisonous plants and wild hogs and…</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: So the whole ecosystem is six thousand
years old. Five to six thousand years old. About that. Five or six.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all
the cyrpess strands, probably in the world. I don’t know of any cypress
strand bigger. It’s about twenty miles long, or nineteen, nineteen to
twenty, nineteen… and right here it’s about five miles wide, four and a
half, five. So, again, it’s twenty miles long, three to five miles wide.
And over here –</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: The oldest carbon dating they’ve done on
any of the peat out here is fifty-seven hundred years. That’s with
carbon-14.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MIKE OWEN</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Why isn’t it wet? Orlean wrote about wading
through black, corrosive water. She said it was the scariest experience
of her life. And when I spoke to you on the phone, you said wear heavy
boots, long pants and…</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: There’s usually water. We’ve been going
through a bit of a drought. Say, have you seen that movie, Medicine Man?
That’s a good movie about protecting nature. It shows there could be
something important in a rain forest we don’t even know about, like a
cure for cancer.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s not even hot. I was expecting it to be
awful. Sun beating down, wading through water, looking out for snakes,
wild hogs. I was thinking it would be dramatic. Alligators.
Something!</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: The alligators are over by the lakes. The
temperature’s a blessing for us. This time of year can get uncomfortably
hot. Green anole. Florida’s most common.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: It had been a hard day and I hadn’t seen
what I’d come to see. Maybe the ghost orchid was a ghost after all.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ORLEAN</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: What Laroche did was wrong. Those flowers
belong to all of us, all 250 million of us – 250? I think it’s up to 270
now – And belonging to all of us means they belong to none of us. Nobody
has a right to take them. Not me, not you, not John Laroche, not…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a
legendary creature called a Swamp Ape. Have you ever heard stories or
–</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: Tourist garbage! I don’t know why people
need to invent silly creatures to make nature fascinating. Isn’t nature
amazing enough?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I just asked because she mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: That night I called Laroche.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I didn’t see anything but bare roots.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ORLEAN</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: What I didn’t say to him is that life seemed
to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid –
wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little
fantastic and fleeting and out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What I didn’t say to him was that life
seemed to be filled with things that were just like the ghost orchid –
wonderful to imagine and easy to fall in love with but a little
fantastic and fleeting and out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Jesus Christ, of course there are ghost
orchids out there! I’ve stolen them!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAROCHE</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Beautifully written. A really unique
piece.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Thank you. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We’re big fans.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And Laroche is such a fun character.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Yeah, John’s a character all right.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s funny and fresh. And sad in a way.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Well, thanks. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So we were wondering, what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Oh, um, Random House wants me to expand it
into a book. So I’ll be doing that.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And there’ll be more of Laroche?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Yeah. More John, more orchids.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Y’know, we’d really like to option it.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: You want to make this into a movie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Laroche is such a fun character. So…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: No shit I’m a fun character. Who’s gonna
play me?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I’ve got to write it first. Someone’s gotta
write the screenplay. Most things never get made. It’s premature to
–</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I think I should play me.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’ve got all the right qualities. While you
write, I’ll take an acting class.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I wear this just to screw with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Most of them don’t even bother calling me
John anymore. It’s “Crazy White Man” now.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAROCHE</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I was trying to order some pink string
beans from Argentina.</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I figure just because Project Ghost Orchid
is dead, we’re not closing shop.</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: Listen, John –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: We’ll get into plant multiplication. Buy
little ones, turn ’em into big ones, sell ’em at a profit. Simple plant
multiplication for the masses.</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: John, we’re thinking maybe now’s a good time
for you to take a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I don’t need a vacation, Buster.</p>
<p><strong>baxley</strong>: It’s a good time. Things are slow.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Y’know, the guys on my crew here, all they
do is smoke weed all day. I been meaning to talk to you about that. So
if it’s a question of productivity –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: They’re gonna fire me. Goddamn politics.
Crazy White Man’s bad publicity. I can’t believe I’m dealing with this!
Like I could give a damn. If they fire me, I’ll sue. I already did some
legal research on this when I was doing the other shit. They can’t fire
me. And I ain’t going to quit.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: John, it’s Susan. Orlean. So, I was just
wondering if you might be willing to talk some more.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: C’mon, John, I’m trying to put together a
book. Don’t just abandon me down here.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’m no longer interested in orchids. I’m
pursuing other avenues. I apologize for any inconvenience this might
cause you.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: We could use the rain, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: Yeah? I’m moving to L.A. I just wrote
a screenplay. I sent it to a lot of agents. But if they turn me down,
I’ll go there and market it myself. I used to be in marketing in New
York, so I know exactly how to sell this thing. Where’s a nice place to
live if you don’t have a car?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You kind of need a car. I guess West
Hollywood would be okay.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: So you recommend West Hollywood
then.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m not recommending it.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: I moved down here for a change, and I
wrote the screenplay. Just like that. It’s a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: You don’t believe in anything?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: Well, you can’t know until you
experience it. That requires accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and
Savior. Believe me. Lookit, if I was to show you a bottle of clear
liquid and told you it was vodka, how would you know if it really was or
if it was water? There’s only one way.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’d smell it.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: No. You can’t smell vodka. You’d have
to taste it, right?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It could be poison. I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: Look, let’s go with the analogy I’m
drawing here. It’s not poison. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: GUY ON BENCH</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>guy on bench</strong>: That’s all I’m saying. So West
Hollywood, huh? I think I’ll make it out this year. Because how long can
you look at an ocean, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I have failed. I have nothing to say. I am
fat. I am not a writer.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Mr. Kaufman, do you mind if I ask what type
of work you do for Sony?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m a writer.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: A song writer?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, I’m a screenwriter.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, wow! Good for you. You mind if I ask
what your movie’s about?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s about flowers.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I heard about that! Drug flowers, right?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I heard about that! That’s great!
Action-adventure is my favorite genre.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: How was Florida, man?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Cool! Hey, my script’s going amazing! Right
now I’m working out an Image System. Bob calls it an invaluable asset.
Because of my multiple personality theme, I’ve chosen the motif of
broken mirrors to show my protagonist’s fragmented self. Bob teaches
that an Image System greatly increases the complexity of an aesthetic
emotion.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You sound like you’re in a cult.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: No, it’s just good writing technique.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: DONALD</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There is no Swamp Ape. It was invented for
people who can’t find the actual world fascinating. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh, okay. I didn’t know that. Sorry. Hey, I
got a song! “Happy Together.” I was worried about putting a song in a
thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the greatest screenplay ever
written, did exactly that. Mixed genres.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I need to go to bed, Donald. I haven’t
slept in a week.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: … so we open the swamp… okay, flashback to
young Laroche had turtles… Okay, Susan says What Is Passion? And okay we
open on a swamp and suddenly a white van comes tearing around…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There are too many ideas and things and
people, too many directions to go. I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the
world down to a more manageable size.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Such sweet, sad insights. So true.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: And you’re… I like looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>orlean photo</strong>: I like looking at you, too.
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know how to do this. I’m afraid
I’ll disappoint you. You’ve written a beautiful book. I can’t sleep. I’m
losing my hair. I’m fat and repulsive –</p>
<p><strong>orlean photo</strong>: Shhh. You’re not. Whittle it down,
focus on one thing in the story, find the thing you care passionately
about and write about that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile,
beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing at her desk. She looks at the
camera and talks to us: “John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a stick,
pale-eyed, slouch- shouldered…”</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hey, hey.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You seem chipper.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m good. I have some new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Cool. Me too. I’m putting in a chase
sequence now. The killer flees on horseback with the girl. The cop is
after them on a motorcycle. It’s like a battle between motors and
horses.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: They’re all still one person, right?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Yeah, hey, that’s the big pay-off.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, it sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Thanks, man. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I suppose what I’d been doing in Florida was
trying to understand how people found order and contentment and a sense
of purpose in the universe by fixing their sighs on one single desire.
Now I was also trying to understand how someone could end such intense
desire without a trace.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah what?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Hello, John, it’s Susan.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah hi.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So, how’s everything going?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Great! I’m training myself on the internet.
It’s fascinating. I’m doing pornography. It’s amazing how much these
suckers will pay for photographs of chicks. And it doesn’t matter if
they’re fat or ugly or what.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: That sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: It’s great is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So I’ve been meeting a lot of orchid people,
going to shows, I thought you might want to hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Sorry. I am officially no longer interested
in orchids or the losers who are still interested in them. The end.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: If you really loved something, wouldn’t a
little of it always linger?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Susan Orlean drives. The golden light of
the afternoon sun caresses her sweet face. She talks to us. “Florida is
a landscape of transition and mutation, a hybrid of …”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Susan and her husband eat dinner in
silence. A dying relationship. Husband: You want to do something
tonight? Susan: I should work. Y’know. I got stuff…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m so thrilled I get to adapt your book,
get to merge my thoughts with yours. I love that. It’s intimate, like a
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Not like a marriage.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Maybe what marriage could be.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Isn’t it ironic? You adapting my book? My
three years in Florida meditating on my inability to experience passion
resulted in my finding it with you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: … and in the final sequence Susan as a
young girl swings alone in the backyard. From high in the air she sees
her parents in separate rooms staring blankly in opposite directions.
This symbolizes the profound scarring their waning passion has had on
the girl’s psyche, how she became afraid to ever really love something
because it would go away.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yallo?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hi, Charlie. It’s Valerie. Just bugging you
again. How’s everything going?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Good. I think really good now.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Great. So I spoke to Susan yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I told her you were making terrific
progress and she’s really excited to read the script.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh. Good.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And she said she’d love to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Um, well, y’know, for me it’s distracting
to… or confusing to discuss what I’m exploring in the screenplay at this
point… before I finish… it. So…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: That’s fair. I’ll let her know.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Tell Susan I’d be very happy to meet her at
a future date. As she sees fit.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Okay. Good enough.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: And tell her how much I love her book. Say
I think she’s such a great writer.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay. Nice talking to you. Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You can sit here and pretend to be a
writer, mocking the seriousness of what I do, like some kind of fucking
funhouse mirror version of me! But let me tell you, you don’t know what
writing is!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: She thinks I’m repulsive.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Movie opens.: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old,
bald, paces the room. His voice-over carpets the scene. “I am old. I am
fat. I am bald. My toenails have turned strange. I am repulsive. How
repulsive? I don’t know for I suffer from a condition called Body
Dysmorphic Disorder.”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … we need to talk about the orchid script.
Valerie called yesterday. They’re getting antsy.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I think I’ve got it on track now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Good. She said you sounded weird.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No Hollywood bullshit. Just raw truth.
Sometimes that takes a while to find.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay. What’s the time frame here?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s goddamned honest, Jerry. It’s
true.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked- up
internet thing. It’s a girl taking a shit, but a trout comes out. You
got e- mail yet? I’ll send it to you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: This is more honest than anything anyone’s
ever done before in a movie, I’ll tell you that. The only truth we can
offer is the truth that’s our own experience of the world. “The great
poet, in writing himself, writes his time.” T.S. Eliot.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It sounds good, buddy. But we do need to give
Valerie a ballpark –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m sick of their constant harassment!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: On December 21, 1993 John Laroche and three
Seminoles illegally removed one hundred and thirty rare plants from the
Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.</p>
<p><strong>motes</strong>: You’ve been checking out the displays?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>motes</strong>: It’s the Miami centennial, we’re supposed to
illustrate something about Florida history.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Right. Now Laroche is part of Florida
history. As a mannequin.</p>
<p><strong>motes</strong>: It’s a world of words to the end of it./In
which nothing solid is its solid self. You’ll have to forgive me, I’m a
reformed poetry professor.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>motes</strong>: Wallace Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The greatest poverty is not to live/In a
physical world, to feel that one’s desire/is too difficult to tell from
despair.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman’s voice</strong>: Kaufman sits across from Valerie, a
pretty film executive. He eyes her as she picks at her salad. She looks
up and he looks down. He sweats. She compliments him on his work. She
rubs her nose. He pulls at his nostrils. He tries to sound like he knows
what he’s talking about. He’s full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: John, it’s Susan.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I went to the Orchid Society Show a couple
of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: There was a display of you stealing the
ghost orchids. You’re famous.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’m not involved in that world now.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So, look, John, I still haven’t seen a
ghost. And I was wondering –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I’ll take you in.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Really? Thank you so much! I just…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Tomorrow. Pick me up at 5:30 am or it’ll
get too hot. I’ll buy all the supplies we’ll need.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Kaufman jerks off to the book jacket photo
of Susan Orlean.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What?! What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I finished. My script. I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Ourobouros.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The snake is called Ourobouros.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I don’t think so. But it’s cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi. Because at the end when he forces
the woman, who’s really just him, to eat herself, he’s also eating
himself to death.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m insane. I’m Ourobouros.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I don’t know what that is.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’ve written myself into my screenplay.
It’s eating itself. I’m eating myself.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh. That’s kinda weird.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s self-indulgent. It’s narcissistic.
It’s solipsistic. It’s pathetic. I’m pathetic. I’m fat and pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’m sure you had a good reason, Charles.
You’re an artist.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The reason is I’m too timid to speak to the
woman who wrote the book. Because I’m pathetic. Because I have no idea
how to write. Because I can’t make flowers fascinating. Because I
suck.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, am I in the script, too?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m going to New York. I’ll meet her.
That’s it. That’s what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Don’t get mad at me for saying this,
Charles, but Bob’s got a seminar in New York this weekend. So if you’re
stuck –</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Give yourself a reality check. Phoniness is
transparent, and it is tiresome. Take pleasure in the beauty and wonders
of nature. A flower is God’s miracle.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Where are our supplies?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Got everything I need right here.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I remember one time when I was a kid,
fifteen or so, my mother and I came to the Fakahatchee to look for a
ghost to photograph. We walked for hours, through the most intense heat
I’d ever felt. We couldn’t find one. I wanted to turn back. But my mom
said, no.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAROCHE</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: He made it sound like a Bible story, the
hopeful journey through darkness into light. I never thought many people
in the world were like John, but I was realizing more and more that
Laroche was an extreme, not an aberration – most people in some way or
another do strive for something exceptional, something to pursue, even
at their peril, rather than abide an ordinary life.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Here we go. Encyclia tempensis.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Clamshell orchid. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: See, I found you two already. I’ll show you
every orchid you want today. I’ll find you a fucking ghost if it kills
me. Rigid Epidendrum. That’s an ugly-ass orchid. But I’m no snob. I’m
interested in all orchids. Not just pretty ones.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: They’re right nearby. Just follow me.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Reads Vanity Fair. Funny detail: New Yorker
writer reads Vanity Fair. Use!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Thanks. Could I get some lemon please?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not at
all what I imagined. Interesting!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Laroche, can I ask you a personal
question?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: We’re not lost.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I have nothing. I am nothing. I am fat. I
am over. I am lost.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: We’re not lost.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Well, y’know it’s not really about
collecting the thing, it’s about –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The sundial isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: It is so working.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So, John…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Okay, fuck the sundial. We’ll just go
straight and eventually we’ll get there.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, it’s Jerry. I woke you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How’s it going? Has it been helpful to talk
to the writer? What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. Susan Orlean.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, I mean, are you making headway?
Valerie’s breathing down my neck.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You can’t rush inspiration. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, fine. Um, the other reason I’m calling
is to tell you Me, Myself, and I is just amazing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What the hell is Me, Myself, and I?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Your brother’s script. It’s tight, inventive.
A smart, edgy thriller. The best spec script I’ve read this year.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh. Good.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m gonna sell it for a shitload. Two fucking
talented guys in one family. Y’know, maybe you could bring Donald on to
help you finish the orchid thing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Jerry, don’t say that. I mean –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just a thought, buddy. He’s really goddamn
amazing at structure.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Jerry, I gotta go. I have an appointment. I
gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Adios, buddy. Finish! Finish!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am fat. I can’t write. I am repulsive. I
am old. I have accomplished nothing. I am just one more old, fat, bald
man on the street.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I’ve done this a million times. Whenever
everything’s killing me, I just say to myself, screw it, and go straight
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>registrar</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Years from now you’ll be standing around a
posh cocktail party congratulating yourself on how you spent an entire
weekend locked in a room with an asshole, an opinionated arrogant
asshole, for your art.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I am pathetic. I am a loser. I am fat.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: So… what is the substance of writing? Nothing
as trivial as words is at the heart of this great art, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I have failed. I am panicked. I am fat. I
have sold out. I am worthless. I…</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Literary talent is not enough. First, last,
and always, the imperative is to tell a story.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle
said, when storytelling goes bad in a society, the result is decadence.
Well, just look around you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of
conviction that brings me here with all these desperate idiots lapping
up everything this bag of wind spouts. Easy answers. Rules to short-cut
yourself to success. And here I am, because my jaunt into the abyss
brought me nothing. Well, isn’t that the risk one takes for attempting
something new. I should leave here right now. I’ll start over – I need
to face this project head on and –</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: … and God help you if you use voice- over in
your work, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: God fucking help you! It’s flaccid, sloppy
writing. Any idiot can write voice-over narration to explain the
thoughts of a character. You must present the internal conflicts of your
character in image, in symbol. Film is a medium of movement and
image.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: You want your writing to be original. You
want to have an original voice like Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let
me tell you something, my friends. The key to originality is not
eccentricity.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Long speechs are antithetical to the nature
of cinema. The Greeks called it stykomythia – the rapid exchange of
ideas. A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the
camera hold on the actor’s face for a minute. Look at the second hand on
your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and
you’ll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. The
ontology of the screen is that it’s always now and it’s always action
and it’s always vivid. Life is rarely vivid. And that’s an important
point. We are not recreating life on the screen. Writers are not tape
recorders. Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee
shop? Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. Real
people are not interesting. There’s not a person in this world – and I
include myself in this – who would be interesting enough to take as is
and put in a movie as a character.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you think
Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You talked about Crisis as the ultimate
decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens, where people don’t change, they
don’t have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing
is resolved. More a reflection of the real world –</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: The real world? The real fucking world? First
of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you’ll
bore your audience to tears. Secondly: Nothing happens in the real
world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day!
There’s genocide and war and corruption! Every fucking day somewhere in
the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! Every
fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy
someone else! People find love! People lose it, for Christ’s sake! A
child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church!
Someone goes hungry! Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman!
If you can’t find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don’t know
much about life! And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two
hours with your movie? I don’t have any use for it! I don’t have any
bloody use for it!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Mr. McKee?</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m the guy you yelled at this morning.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: I need more.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I was the one who thought things didn’t
happen in life.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Oh, right, okay. Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: I make it a rule not to give private
tutorials to my seminar students. It wouldn’t be fair to the others.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Mr. McKee, please. My even standing here is
very scary. I don’t meet people well. I’m self-conscious and timid. But
what you said this morning shook me to the bone. What you said was
bigger than my screenwriting choices. It’s about my choices as a human
being. Please.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: I could use a drink, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: We turned to the right and saw only more
cypress and palm and sawgrass</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: … We followed it like a beacon all the way
to the road.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s the book. I wanted to present it
simply, without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story. I
wanted to show flowers as God’s miracles. I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid. It’s about disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: I see. That’s not a movie. You must go back
and put in the drama.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’ve got pages of false starts and wrong
approaches. I’m way past my deadline. I can’t go back.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Ah, the everpresent deadline. Yes, I was
doing a Kojak once and… it was hell.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: You’ve taken my course before?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: My brother did. My twin brother Donald.
He’s the one who got me to come.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: Twin screenwriters. Julius and Philip
Epstein,who wrote Casablanca were twins.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You mentioned that in class.</p>
<p><strong>mckee</strong>: The finest screenplay ever written.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Climax. A revolution in values from
positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony – a
value swing at maximum charge that’s absolute and irreversible.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Great writers residence.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, how’s the trip? Gettin’ it on with that
lady journalist? You dog you!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. Listen, I’m calling to say
congratulations on your script.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Isn’t that cool? Jerry says he can make me,
like, high-sixes against a mill-five.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s great, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I want to thank you for all your help.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I wasn’t any help.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: C’mon, you let me stay in your place and
your integrity inspired me to even try.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, look, I’ve been thinking, maybe you’d
be interested in hanging out with me in New York for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh my God, yes! I’m flattered!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: So, like, what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Script kind of makes fun of me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Sorry. I was trying something. I –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Hey, I don’t mind. It’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay. So, what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You and me are so different, Charles. We’re
different talents.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I know. Just for fun. How would the great
Donald end this script?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: The great Donald. Well, I mean… do you need
the whole court case?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Uh, it’s what happened to Laroche. It’s
kind of important.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It’s boring. No offense. A courtroom scene
should be dramatic. Stick the ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Um. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Too much about orchids. Get rid of it. Pare
that stuff down to a minimum. Frankly, I’d focus more on the
relationship between the brothers. I think that’s the gold here. No one
cares about orchids.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The book’s about orchids.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: That’s a problem. But don’t let it ruin the
movie. I mean, for example, use the orchids in a more dramatic way. Have
some kind of bang-up, crazy action sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp
better. It’s a tremendous fictional world. A setting of great dramatic
possibility.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s true. But –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: And put some twists in. Reveal some
surprising thing about Laroche. God, what am I doing giving suggestions
to you? I mean you’re like a seasoned professional. You’re an
artist.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: C’mon, you’re the “mill-five” kid.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Shut up! I love the Laroche porno web-site
stuff. Is that real? Maybe make a bigger deal of that. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I think it’s real. I haven’t actually seen
the site.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It’s sex, man! Incorporate it.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Oh, hi, I was doing some research. I found
Laroche’s site and… I’m embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Jesus, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: What? She’s kinda cute. You don’t like her?
I dunno, I think she’s okay. It’s not like I’m marrying her.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Jesus. Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I think this is maybe a good thing for the
script. Go ask her about this.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m not gonna ask her about this.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: You want me to? I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I could easily pretend I’m you.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So you’ll pick me up? Yeah, tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What was she wearing?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I don’t know. Like a dress maybe.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Did she look at me? At you?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Finally! Da-da-da-daaaaah! S. Orlean, TWA
flight 651. Arriving Miami 10:20 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t want to do this, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: We’ll go together. It’ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s so weird to actually see that van in
real life.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: So you want to build the symbolic charge of
the story’s imagery from the particular to the universal. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, but when you’re creating an image
system, how do you know –</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I’ll get a closer look. You wait here.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, I want to go. I should go. I mean, it
should be me, right? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Go for it, bro. You the man.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Holy…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Darlin’, I dunno what’s come over you!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Don’t stop, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Johnny! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I just… nobody, I just –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Um. I’m just. I was at the wrong house. I’m
looking for the Johnson family.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: I got your Johnson family right here.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Honey, come back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Who the hell sent you? Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m not –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: What the fuck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m the guy adapting her book. Her book
about you.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Jesus Fucking Christ. Why the fuck were you
in my backyard?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I was, um, trying… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Who’s the bloody fat guy?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: This is the fellow adapting your book for
the movies, darling’.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Really? I wanted to meet – Oh. What does he
know?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know anything. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: He knows about the greenhouse. We can’t
have this appear on the silver screen.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It won’t. I don’t even under –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Johnny, I’m so tired now.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: He needs to be gotten rid of.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Small article in newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Johnny, come lie on top of me.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Focus, darling’. Is this credible?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Um, oh… this screenwriter was killed doing
research in Jamaica a few years ago. Screenwriter, you have a car?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I, um, no, I –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: We drive his car there, leave it on the side
of the swamp. That works.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Good. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I thought I had a sense of you from your
book. I had a little crush on you, to tell the truth. You’re different
than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Look, I don’t care what you two are you
doing. Please don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Hey, here’s one of my lines. “Isn’t it
ironic? You adapting my book? My three years in Florida meditating on my
inability to experience passion resulted in my finding it with you.”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I was trying to do something.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Well, it’s kind of pathetic, dontcha
think?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Here’s me! Here’s me again! “I wanted to
know what it’s like to care about something passionately.”</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You can laugh, but I didn’t make that line
up. That’s a quote from your book.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Yeah, I know, Charlie-boy. Chill. I’m
laughing at who I used to be. It’s sad.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: So now you learned about passion. From
Weirdo Laroche. Bully for you.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: You can’t learn about passion. You can be
passion. And it wasn’t John who made me passion. It was orchids.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I thought you didn’t even like orchids.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I lied about what happened at the end of the
book. On the way out of the swamp…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: The jewel of the Fakahatchee.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I still don’t get it. I mean, there it is. I
can see it’s pretty, but –</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: You’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Back in John’s basement he explained his
real plans for the ghost. He’d discovered a chemical inside with
psychoactive properties. His plan had always been to clone the flower
and make a fortune marketing this drug. It was Laroche’s kind of plan,
it wasn’t a controlled substance because the government didn’t know it
existed.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: The first time I tried it, the split second
it took effect, I understood orchids. I loved them with a passion I’d
never felt for anything. For anyone.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Isn’t it curious? An orchid made me
passionate about orchids.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You’re throwing the truth away for a
chemical confusion of your synapses –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: With this powder I am passionate about
everything.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ORLEAN</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: This spot looks good. Now how do we do
this? Hit him in the head with a rock first? Keeping in mind we can only
hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him
slipping and falling onto the rock.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Holy Jesus. Holy… Hey, baby, hey…</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Should we drown him, then hit him on the
head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if the heart’s stopped. These new
forensic guys are very smart. We really have to know our corpses to
stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular
changes.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAROCHE</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t write this kind of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Don’t get all huffy, I was simply –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Yeah, let’s, baby.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Not now. We got to kill that guy. And now I
guess that other guy as well.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Ohhh.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: For Christ’s sake, why didn’t you do
something while we were in the car?</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: My back had seized. I couldn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: We’ve gotta ditch this thing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s a rental! It’s a rental!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: That’s beautiful! What’s that, Johnny?
What’s that one called? I just so want to fuck that flower, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Asclepias lanceolata. Red milkweed.
Extremely fuckable. But we don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Um, y’know… Charlie or something.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Charlie! Listen, let’s talk! This pie is
big enough for four people! Why are there two of him?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Identical twigs? Did I say twigs? I meant
twins.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You
want to watch out for that. That’s some evil shit. Cut you up.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Fuck you, Laroche!</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Just tryin’ to be helpful. Walk with us and
I’ll be sure you avoid all the pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards
and backwards. There’s alligators and poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild
hogs.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Wait. Do you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald, that sounds bad.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Watch out, watch out, watch out!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I think we’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Fuck! Fuck, Donald, we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: We’re okay. How’s your leg?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know. How’s your back.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It’s fine. My back is fine.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: No. But don’t let them get you, too. You got
a fucking awesome third act.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing to
say and an awful time to say it, but I’m sorry I didn’t get to know you
better. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: It’s really… You’ve been really nice.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: See, it’s just I thought I knew you
already. I thought you were me. And I hated me.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: Well, don’t do that anymore. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: Jesus, that writer guy.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon plastic
jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline! Dontcha think?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Darlin’, please.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Can we fuck now, baby? Fuck like lemons?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You gotta help me. You gotta help me.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: They’re after me. They’ve got guns. They
killed my brother.</p>
<p><strong>mike owen</strong>: Who’s got guns? What are you –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Hey, it’s the screenwriter!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: There’s a thing back there! You don’t want
to be here.</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: You’re right, I don’t want to be here. I’m
tired, let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I love your gun, baby. Can we trade?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Stand back, sweetness.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Where’d Johnny go?</p>
<p><strong>laroche</strong>: Susie!</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Oh, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’d just stare at your picture, and you
looked so sweet. I read your words and I thought you were smart and
maybe lost and lonely like me. And the way you wrote about Laroche. You
said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth –</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: Oh, Johnny. Johnny’s teeth. Oh…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I figured you could look at me and see
something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find
something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would
be nicer than the one I write day in and day out in my head. Would it
be?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: You’re really so wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: So wonderful. I can see inside your soul. It
glows with orange sadness. It’s raining inside you. I want to run
through your dripply dripples. It’s so beautiful. I love you. I do.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It’s the drugs.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: No, it’s me. It’s the real me. Look at you.
I just want to hold you and – Oh, crap, it’s wearing off. Crap!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Okay, bye.</p>
<p><strong>orlean</strong>: I can’t let you go, fatty. I can’t let you
make this public.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Donald!</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: My brother is not fat. He’s not bald. My
brother is a great writer! He was trying to do something important!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s Mike Owen. John Laroche. Susan
Orlean. I don’t know what that is. I think it might be a Swamp Ape. And
that’s Donald, my twin brother. He saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You two really look alike.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. Yes, we do.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh, I love McKee! Oh, hi. Haven’t seen you in
a while.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Hi. Yeah, I’ve been away.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So you studying screenwriting?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m actually finishing one up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Good for you! Me too. God, it’s so hard to
get in, huh? Everyone and their brother is writing a screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yeah. Actually I’m writing this one for
Sony Pictures.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Really? Wow. Really? That’s so cool.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ALICE</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s tough. Let’s see… about being
yourself, maybe. It’s about learning that if you can’t love yourself,
you can’t really love anyone.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s true. God, that’s so true. It’s such
an important message, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: See, my twin brother was murdered recently
–</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh God! I’m sorry. That’s so horrible.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thanks. Like part of me ripped away.
Forever. It was a wake up call.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m so sorry. You poor man.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Anyway, it helped put things in
perspective. Life is a miracle. All life, from the flower to the human
being. You. Me. And I want to show people that. For my brother. For
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Listen, do you mind if I sit for a sec?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: But you’re working.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s a stupid job, y’know. I’m Alice.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I like that name. Charlie. I’ve always really
liked that name. Charlie.</p>
