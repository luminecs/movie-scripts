WANDERER:</b> The STREETS are filled with MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of
DOMINOES. They are assembled in many colorful patterns seen in such 80’s
television programs as “THAT’S INCREDIBLE!” and “RIPLEY’S… BELIEVE IT OR
NOT!”.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Ms. Harvey… my name is Taryn Miles. I’m a
criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I’m here to ask you a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Sure… I’ll tell you everything I know.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Thirty-six hours ago… ten million dollars was
stolen from an armored car that was subsequently found abandoned at the
Hoover Dam. <b> EXT. DESERT – DAWN – THIRTY-SIX HOURS BEFORE </b></p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Where is the money?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: I think that you’re lying. I think you know
exactly where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You’re trying to scare me into falsely
incriminating myself… and it’s not working. I said I’d tell you
everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Is it true that you were hired to track down
and capture the thieves… and then deliver them to Drake Bishop… owner of
the Stratosphere Hotel &amp; Casino?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: You then learned where the thieves had hidden
the money… and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out
in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: EDNA! WE KNOW YOU’RE IN HERE!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Sick boy… Sick-em!</p>
<p><strong>she lets got of the collar and chi-chi sprints around
the</strong>: CORNER…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Chi-Chi! CHI-CHI!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven,
bitch!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: The next one is going to doggie hell!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All we want is the money, Edna!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Chi-Chi… my poor Chi-Chi.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Is that you, Domino?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Nice to see you again, Edna.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Your father must be so proud. Look what has
become of his little angel.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Listen bitch! We’ve got your son! If you
don’t deliver the money… we’re gonna wax his fucking ass!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: YOU DON’T HAVE SHIT!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t fuck with us, Edna! There are at least
three more limbs where that one came from!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I can certainly think of one more!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>she unloads two rounds. two shotgun blasts rip holes in the
wall</strong>: BETWEEN ED AND CHOCO. EVERYONE HITS THE GROUND.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: HE’S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: PROVE IT!</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: How did Locus Fender lose his arm?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He had the combination to the safe tattooed
on his arm. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE – NEXT </b> Choco and Alf arrive in
the doorway with LOCUS. He seems to be regaining consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>locus</strong>: Momma! What’d you do with my momma!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: LOCUS! BABY… I’M HERE!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Turn over your weapon, Edna!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Give her the combination to the safe or you’re
gonna be twenty- five percent more paraplegic.</p>
<p><strong>locus</strong>: Momma… I need you to <i>say…</i> exactly as I
do. The combination code is on the wrist… just above the palm. You’ll
need to get the decoder from my bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Not so fast!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I’m coming with you. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE –
BEDROOM – NEXT </b> Domino follows Edna down the hallway into the
BEDROOM. Edna immediately begins to rifle through the middle dresser
drawer. Domino notices a huge VELVET PAINTING of a young Edna as a
SHOWGIRL hanging above the water bed.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Is that the decoder?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE – MOMENTS LATER
</b></p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You have twenty minutes to open that safe.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra? I
knew Frank.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Who didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Is that the bitch from <i>Murder, She
Wrote?</i></p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Be kind to your sitter.</p>
<p><strong>nanny</strong>: Time for bed… little one.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Domino! Give the goddamn numb- chucks a rest
already. It’s time for supper!</p>
<p><strong>sorority girl</strong>: Look at you fat fucking bitches.</p>
<p><strong>sorority girl</strong>: Look at this fucking fat! It’s
fucking disgusting!!!</p>
<p><strong>sorority girl</strong>: Look at those mosquito bites. What’s
it like having the body of a ten year old boy?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Did you get a nose job?</p>
<p><strong>sorority girl</strong>: AAHHH! OHHH MY GOD!!</p>
<p><strong>counselor</strong>: What is it about sorority life that
bothers you?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Everything. It is a ghastly existence.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Why must you fight… everything that is
normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy… if only
you allowed yourself to fit the mold.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: The mold? I am living among these
crypto-fascist Orange County cunts… with daddy’s BMW and the boob job…
just waiting to implode.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one
years old and they’re already looking for a husband. Stupid fucking
cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not
me.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Must you use that awful word?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Cunt.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Cunt.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I said stop it.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Cunt. It’s just a word. Why does everyone in
this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit
of indecent conversation?</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: This is your mid-term exam?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: She’s dyslexic. She’s always had trouble
with assignments. <b> EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH – SUNSET </b> Domino sits
alone on the beach… smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: As a bail-bondsman… I am the go- between
for the court and the criminal. For a ten percent fee… I will guarantee
the amount set by the court.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Yes… I’m here for the bounty hunter
seminar.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: If the felon does a no-show on his trial
date, I will bring in a bounty hunter to recapture the defendant or I
will face having to pay the court myself.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: This occurs most frequently… because the
collateral or guarantee given… to the bail bondsman… turns out to be
worthless… or… uh… difficult to liquidate… In layman’s terms. We get ten
percent of the bail.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: In a few minutes… Ed Martin will take the
stage and begin the seminar on how to become a bounty hunter. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>loser #1</strong>: Hot damn… I knew there were groupies… but
I never thought they’d show up at a seminar.</p>
<p><strong>loser #2</strong>: How about it? You want to ride some bounty
hunter cock?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Fuck you, douche-bag.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take
a look at the bathroom window?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who’s
the girl?</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bathroom window. Five minutes. I’ll have the
engine running.</p>
<p><strong>fat woman</strong>: For Chrissakes… when is this thing gonna
get started? I left my kids at Chuckie-fucking-Cheese and it’s gonna
close in an hour. <i>What kind of piece of shit seminar is this?</i></p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: To say that Choco is a product of a broken
home is to presume a home existed in the first place. No, Choco never
had a home. Not unless you count the ten or so juvenile correction
facilities where he spent his childhood.</i></p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What the fuck is this shit?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What the… <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT.
HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER – PARKING LOT – NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit
the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield.
She grips it in her right hand… threatening them.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Where the fuck do you think you’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: These people paid good money for a
seminar!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You want your money back? Here… take it.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I don’t want my fucking money back… I want a
job. You take me on as part of your team… or else.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Or else what?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I’ve been training since I was twelve.
Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it… I can fight with it. I’m a
hard worker and a fast learner. Nothing scares me. I’m not afraid to
die.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a
pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Because I want justice. I want to help put
these sleazebags back in jail where they belong. And I want to have a
little fun.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay… Pretty Woman. I’ll give you tonight. See
if you can take it.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The
name is Domino.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Domino. Do you have a last name… Domino?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No last names. Just Domino. The less you
know about me the better, okay?</p>
<p><strong>choco</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: On a raid. If she wants to see justice… we gonna
take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE – NEXT </b> The El
Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW
INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed
parks the El Camino next to the curb. <b> INT. EL CAMINO – NEXT</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bail jumper’s name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen
years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly
partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to
not show up for trial.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Will you speak the fucking English language? The
poor girl has no clue what you’re talking about. The boy speaks English,
you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he’s around
girls. Thinks it’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tell him it’s not cute. Will you tell him,
Domino!?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You can make this easy, Tina… or you can make it
real complicated. Your son is gonna be dead meat unless you let us bring
him in.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Cookie! Coast is clear baby.</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: Fuckin’ Five-O.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: That night… my coin was tossed. Heads you
live… tails you die.</p>
<p><strong>from their bodies. their limbs flail backwards as though
they</strong>: ARE ATTACHED TO RAG DOLLS.</i></p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: What is this shit?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: We’re not cops. We’re bounty hunters. All we
want is Cookie. You tell us where he is… and I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: And you’ll what?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I’ll give you a lap dance. Bra and panties
on.</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: Awww shiiiitt. Girl… you be freakin’ with
me?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You or your friends touch me… I’ll cut your
balls off. <b> INT. DEXTER HOUSE – KITCHEN – LATER ON </b> Domino is
dancing seductively in the kitchen in a bra and BLACK G-STRING PANTIES.
Creep is in a chair in the center of the room. Domino gyrates to the
music… placing her BUTTERFLY KNIFE in her mouth. She gyrates on Creep’s
crotch. He thrusts his pelvis into her… loving every minute of it,</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Why are we going to the DMV?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The DMV is the de facto conduit for humanity.
Every human being that we track down has a record in their database.
Every other database… social security… credit bureau… LAPD… FBI… relies
on the DMV as its hub. Claremont has people on the inside who feed us
information. <b> INT. DMV – SANTA MONICA – NEXT </b> The group now moves
through the DMV. The internal maze of cubicles filled with anonymous
Government employees.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The rich… the poor… and everyone in between is a
slave to this institution.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And the gatekeepers of humanity turn out to be a
bunch of fat, sassy black women.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey Shantelle… have you seen Claremont?</p>
<p><strong>shantelle</strong>: He’s in the lounge with Keisha. <b></p>
<p><strong>man at a gas station outside of barstow. he tips his hat in
her</strong>: DIRECTION…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: So Ed. What did you do before you became a
bounty hunter?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I was a musician.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Really? Did you play in a band?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I… <i>love…</i> Pat Benatar.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah?! Well… I loved her too.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Oh my God… you mean… the two of you
dated?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We dated off and on for two years. But life on
the road is tough. The pressure of the tour… relationships within a
band… sometimes it leads to jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: How did you meet Choco?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I found him pan-handling on Third Street
Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever
since.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jesus Christ! What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fuckin’ A! We got a five hour drive back to LA
ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD’S – PARKING LOT – MOMENTS LATER </b>
Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT
of the MacDonald’s. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco…
admiring his body.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Put… the gun… down.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Choco… what are you doing…</p>
<p><strong>montage [marlboro on acid]</strong>: :</b> Choco… in the
lounge of the DMV… BREAK-DANCING. He is surrounded by FAT, SASSY BLACK
WOMEN cheering him on. Raoul squeals with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: To the woman who brings beauty and grace
to our profession. Domino Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: Check out the luscious action by the
pool.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Claremont, you’re a chubby chaser.</p>
<p><strong>claremont</strong>: You white folks don’t understand the
natural beauty of a woman’s figure. Those are birthing hips. More
cushion for the pushin’.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Now that’s an ass.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Good lord. <b> EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION –
MASTER BEDROOM – LATER THAT NIGHT </b> Sophie rolls over in bed… unable
to sleep. TECHNO MUSIC blares from downstairs. She removes the silk mask
from her eyes and turns on the television. <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS
MANSION – FAMILY ROOM – NEXT </b> Domino and a shirtless Choco are
dancing in the family room. Choco is flipping NEON BLUE GLOW-STICKS
around in his hands like a rave rat. Domino is flipping her SILVER
DOLLAR through her fingers.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fella could get used to a life this
ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>choco</strong>: Maybe you should fuck her mom then.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT.
SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION – KITCHEN – DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at
the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new
boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: It’s Choco. And he’s not my boyfriend. He’s
a bounty hunter.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He used to date Pat Benatar!</p>
<p><strong>choco</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>choco</strong>: You know what I’m talking about, did you fuck
her?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Do you know this man?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He’s a reality television producer. His name
is Mark Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>taryn</strong>: Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over
some video tapes to the FBI. There’s lots of footage of you. We know
everything. If you don’t come clean… the information on these tapes
could send you to prison for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>fat woman</strong>: EEEHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: YOU’RE GOING DOWNTOWN MOTHERER!</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: They changed the fucking font.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the

racist. You’re excluding all of the mixed race people who have more than
two racial identities. People like Mariah Carey and Vin Diesel. Where is
their category?</p>

to the United Nations to create categories for every permutation of
mixed race individual.</p>
<p><strong>blacktino woman</strong>: First of all… from one Blacktino
woman to another… our concern is not these ridiculous categories. Our
concern is education and family planning. Here you are a 28 year-old
