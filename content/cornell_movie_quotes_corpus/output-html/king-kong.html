<p><strong>angles on</strong>: Defeated, listless ANIMALS, in the bleak
environs of a dilapidated ZOO.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: It is CENTRAL PARK ZOO in depression era NEW
YORK. The PARK itself is like a GARBAGE DUMP, dotted with squalid SHANTY
TOWNS.</p>
<p><strong>images</strong>: The CROWDED STREETS of NEW YORK … beneath
the bustle is a sense of despair.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: SANNY, an old-time VAUDEVILLIAN, hurriedly fixes
a large DROOPY MOUSTACHE on to a YOUNG WOMAN’S TOP LIP … this is ANN
DARROW.</p>
<p><strong>images</strong>: Weird and wonderful snatches of VAUDEVILLE
ACTS follow … singers, jugglers, boxing ladies.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Intercut with:</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN on STAGE … dressed as an ELEGANT GENT,
she launches into `I’m Just Wild About Harry’ with HARRY, a larger-
than-life PERFORMER dressed in a FRILLY DRESS, BRASSY RED WIG and</p>

SWEAT rolls down her face … she tries not to get distracted by the
LAUGHING,</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: A SMATTERING of APPLAUSE from the TINY
AUDIENCE. 40 PEOPLE in a THEATRE designed for 500.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: MANNY in the NOISY, CROWDED DRESSING ROOM,
which is full of VAUDEVILLE PERFORMERS in various stages of undress.</p>
<p><strong>anny</strong>: That’s a funny one! Isn’t that funnier?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s hysterical, Manny. As long as we’re
laughing we won’t be crying over the box office. Talk about
depressing.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN sitting down at a MIRROR, starting to
take off her VEST … a book entitled “ISOLATION” by Jack Driscoll lies
half open on the counter top nearby…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around
like circus ponies! That’s depressing!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: MAUDE, a BLOWSY SINGER, lighting up a
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>maude</strong>: I love a good chorus line!</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s a play.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Who wrote it, Annie?</p>
<p><strong>taps</strong>: Some guy - Driscoll. From the Federal
Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>aude</strong>: Don’t knock it, honey - at least they get an
audience.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’ll pick up …. Ain’t that right, Manny?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: The trick is to start the build right at the
back of your throat… Works well out through the nose too.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Have you eaten today?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Oh, I’m not hungry. Don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hey - you’re all I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You think the kitchen’ll still be open on
Third?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Soup and biscuits - perfect.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: The VAUDEVILLE THEATRE. The DOOR is chained
closed. WORKMEN are up ladders, taking the HOARDINGS down SIGN and
putting a large sign up: THEATRE CLOSED TILL FURTHER NOTICE …</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hey! Harry, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN … rattling the HEAVY STEEL CHAINS that
are LOCKED around the DOORS to the VAUDEVILLE THEATRE …</p>
<p><strong>ladder man</strong>: Not anymore.</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: Oh, Jeez …</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN falls into step beside WESTON as he
hurries along the BUSY SIDEWALK.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Why would I want to do that when we can talk
about it in person?</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: Because that’s what a smart girl would
do.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: But I already sent you my resume - you returned
it unopened.</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: What can I say? Jack Driscoll’s very
particular about who he works with.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Please, just an audition - that’s all I’m
asking.</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: esus - you don’t give up, do you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards.</p>
<p><strong>eston</strong>: ell, that’s too bad - because we just gave
the part to someone else. Sorry, kid - the play is cast.</p>

her hand.</p>

rifle and fires! CLICK! The gun is JAMMED. BRUCE turning to CAMERA,
speaking soundlessly.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A SLEEPY looking LION. A PIECE of MEAT is
lowered into frame … DENHAM appears briefly holding the MEAT. He is
attempting to STIR the yawning ANIMAL into life. CAMERA TILTS UP briefly
revealing the bars of a CAGE. PRESTON’S FACE appears</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: above a CLAPPER BOARD … “TAKE 5”</p>
<p><strong>lose on</strong>: CARL DENHAM sitting in the smoky SCREENING
ROOM. He is nervous … his eyes flick from one INVESTOR to the other …
trying to read the room.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: How much more is there?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Another five reels.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: Lights up.</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: This is it? This is what we get
for our forty grand, Denham? Another one of your Safari pictures?</p>
<p><strong>leazy investor</strong>: You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Come on, fellas - you know the deal - we
agreed to push Maureen’s start date so she could get her teeth
fixed.</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: It’s not the principle of the
thing - it’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>elman</strong>: Carl - you’ve been in production for over two
months -</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam
up the screen - once we get them on the ship.</p>
<p><strong>elman</strong>: What ship?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: The one we’ve hired to get to the
location.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: What location? Carl - you’re supposed to be
shooting on the back-lot.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Yes, I understand that - but fellas, we’re
not making that film anymore - and I’ll tell you why.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: Whoa! Carl - slow down!</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: Is he askin’ for more money?</p>
<p><strong>thugish investor</strong>: He’s asking us to fund a wild
goose- chase.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: I’m talking about a primitive world … never
before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most
spectacular thing you’ve ever seen! That’s where I’ll shoot my
picture!</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: Will there be boobies?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Excuse me, boobies?</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! …
In my experience people only go to these films to observe the … undraped
form of the native girls.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: What are you - an idiot? You think they
asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the
film maker, they showed some class! Not that you’d know what that means
- you cheap low-life!</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: Would you step outside for a moment,
Carl?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Gimme that - quick!</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: You won’t like it, it’s non-alcoholic!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Preston, you have a lot to learn about the
motion picture business.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM quietly places the GLASS against
the SCREENING ROOM DOOR, and presses his ear against it.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: Don’t write him off fellas. He’s hot- headed
sure, but Carl Denham’s made some interesting pictures, he’s had a lot
of … near success.</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: He’s a preening self promoter
…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: DENHAM listening …</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: … an ambitious no-talent! The guy
has “loser” written all over him.</p>
<p><strong>elman</strong>: Look, I understand your disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>hugish investor</strong>: He’s washed up - It’s all over
town!</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: He can’t direct. He doesn’t have
the smarts.</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: This jumped up little turd’s
gonna bankrupt us.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: The animal footage has value?</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: Sure … Universal are desperate for
stock footage.</p>
<p><strong>thuggish investor</strong>: Then sell it! Scrap the picture!
We gotta retrieve something from this debacle.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: ELMAN nods … gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.</p>
<p><strong>zelman</strong>: Get him back in.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The YOUNG ASSISTANT opens the DOOR, steps
into the LOBBY which is …</p>
<p><strong>young assistant</strong>: Mr. Denham?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM and PRESTON hurrying down the
CROWDED SIDEWALK - struggling under the weight of 8 FILM CANS! DENHAM is
glancing back over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: I want the cast and crew on the ship within
the hour.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: o Carl, you can’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Tell `em the studio’s pressured us into an
early departure.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: It’s not ethical!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: hat are they gonna do - sue me? They can get
in line! I’m not going to let them kill my film.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PRESTON follows DENHAM, who steps off the
curb … and flags a CAB down. He cuts across the BUSY ROAD, PRESTON
hurrying behind.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: ou realize none of the camera equipment is
on board. We have no permits … no visas …</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: hat’s why I have you, Preston.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: We have no insurance, no foreign currency -
in fact, we have no currency of any kind -</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM looks back across the STREET and
notices an angry INVESTOR heading towards him.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Get in there!</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: ho’s gonna pay for the ship?</p>
<p><strong>quick moment</strong>: The SLEAZY INVESTOR grabs at the
PARTIALLY OPEN BACK WINDOW of the CAB.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: tep on it!</p>
<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: You’re finished, Denham!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PRESTON sprawled on the SEAT, amid a PILE
of FILM CANS, as the CAB speeds away!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: on’t worry Preston - I’ve had a lot of
practice at this: I’m real good at crapping the crappers.</p>
<p><strong>aerial wide</strong>: DENHAM’S CAB cruises along the CROWDED
STREETS of NEW</p>

marked “lemonade”.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK SEAT.
PRESTON is feverishly scribbling on his NOTEPAD.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: You got it … and tell Maureen - she doesn’t
have six hours to put on her face. If she wants to be in this picture,
she’s gotta be on that boat!</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: She doesn’t want to be in this picture.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: RESTON</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: She pulled out?!</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Yesterday. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: You said we were shooting in Singapore,
right? That’s what you told her?</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: But we’re not shooting in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do is
look her in the eye and lie.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: he`s unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>high wide</strong>: DENHAM’S CAB wends it’s way through BUSY
NEW YORK streets …</p>

<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK
SEAT.</p>

<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The CAB screeches to a SUDDEN HALT in
MID-TRAFFIC … DENHAM jumps out, leaving PRESTON in protest …</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: We gotta delay the shoot - shut production

<p><strong>reston</strong>: Carl!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: I said I’d find a girl.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM leans in the window, PRESTON looks
on PERPLEXED.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN,
with feather boas and peacock fans … gaudy banners proclaiming Miss Lily
Rose … Delaware Du Boise … Velvet Cushions …</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky
BURLESQUE THEATRE. He straightens his tie and heads towards the
DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a
SMALLER GIRL, arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE … DENHAM
eyes the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to
go inside, when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in
the</p>
<p><strong>lose on</strong>: ANN … standing in the MIDDLE of the
SIDEWALK. She is unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at
the BURLESQUE HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot
of anger forming in her stomach.</p>
<p><strong>lose on</strong>: DENHAM’s HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes
lock on ANN through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: away from the THEATRE.</p>
<p><strong>lose on</strong>: DENHAM … watching her leave.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN walks slowly by … her eyes on the
FRUIT. She glances at the VENDOR, SWIPES an APPLE from the TRAY, and

<p><strong>vendor</strong>: You gonna pay for this?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Excuse me …</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM steps up behind them up HOLDING a
NICKEL …</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: THE VENDOR snatches the NICKEL from
DENHAM’S fingers.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: ANN is eating from a FULL PLATE, trying to
disguise her HUNGER. DENHAM walks over carrying a CUP of COFFEE.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville once…
that is a tough audience. If you don’t kill them fast, they kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mr. Denham - I want you to know that I’m not in
the habit of accepting charity from strangers, or for that matter …
taking things that don’t belong to me.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: t was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: It’s just that, I haven’t been paid in a while
…</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: That’s awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call you
Ann?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What type of person are you?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: I’m someone you can trust, Ann. I’m a movie
producer. Believe me, I am on the level, no funny business. Please, sit
down - Please … Please.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’re filming in the Far East?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM looking her in the eye and
lying.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Singapore. On board ship he meets a
mysterious girl. She’s beautiful … she’s fragile … haunted …</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: She falls in love.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: But she doesn’t trust it. She’s not even sure
if she believes in love.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: If she loves someone - it’s doomed.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Good things never last, Mr. Denham.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: So you’re interested?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM hurriedly gathering up his hat and
coat.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well I really -</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Ann? I’m telling you, You’re perfect - look
at you! You’re the saddest girl I ever met … you’re gonna make `em weep,
Ann - you’re gonna break their hearts!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: See, that’s where you’re wrong, Mr. Denham, I
make people laugh, that’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Jack Driscoll?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: ure. Why - wait! You know him?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, no - not personally. I’ve seen his
plays.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: What a writer, huh? And let me tell you Ann,
Jack Driscoll doesn’t want just anyone starring in this picture. He said
to me, “Carl, somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role …”
And as soon as I saw you, I knew -</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Knew what?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: It was always going to be you.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The CROWDED DOCKS … a clutter of SHIPS and
SHANTY TOWNS. A CAB drives onto the DOCKS. DENHAM hops out and holds the
door open for ANN, who emerges carrying a BATTERED SUITCASE.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Is this the moving picture ship?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Not exactly … it’s actually this one over
here.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DENHAM is striding towards a RUSTY
BATTERED TRAMP STEAMER on the OTHER SIDE of the WHARF! This is “The
Venture”.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Haul away …</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Is this all of the equipment? This is all of
it? We’re taking the Bell and Howell? Good. You got all the lenses - you
got the two and the six?</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: Carl!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Yes - Get it on board, fellas. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He
rushes up to DENHAM … his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one
side.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: They’re on their way. I’ve just had
word.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: Men in uniform. The studio called the
cops!</p>

<p><strong>englehorn</strong>: So you are ready for this voyage, Miss
Darrow?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sure…</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?</p>
<p><strong>englehorn</strong>: It isn’t every woman who would take such
a risk.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: Why don’t I show Miss Darrow to her
cabin?</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: Miss Darrow, if you’d just - Hi, my name is
Preston, Carl’s assistant.</p>

cheque?</p>

<p><strong>angle on</strong>: PRESTON goes to lead ANN up the GANG WAY
past some rough- looking sailors, onto the SHIP - “THE VENTURE”.</p>

don’t hesitate to … ask …</p>

<p><strong>jack</strong>: No! I can’t stay, Carl. I have a rehearsal for
which I am now … … three hours late.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: What’s this?</p>

<p><strong>denham</strong>: This is a script? Jack … this is fifteen
pages.</p>

good pages there, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: I’m supposed to be making a feature length
picture.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You told me I had more time. I’m sorry. Look I

shoot.</p>

<p><strong>denham</strong>: Alright, fine. We might as well settle

career as a SCREEN ACTOR has badly stalled.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: Your cabin’s just down here, Mr. Baxter.
May I say how excited we are to have you back with us, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: JACK is hurrying down the corridor towards
the DOOR. He feels the SHIP MOVING! He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who
thrusts a SUITCASE at him.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Be a sport and lend us a hand.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, Christ!</p>

<p><strong>preston</strong>: Let me get the door for you - welcome to
your state room sir.</p>

<p><strong>sleazy investor</strong>: No, no, no!</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: You’re much better off sticking with
film.</p>

is the wash basin. I know, that’s not a pleasant smell - is it? I’m sure
it’ll disperse in a day or two.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He
thrusts a bottle of JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN’S HANDS …</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Knock knock! We can’t have our leading lady
deprived of the necessities of life. Do me a favour - run a bottle down
to Jack. It’ll fend off his migraine.</p>
<p><strong>preston</strong>: They’re still trying to find a place for
him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: You told him my typewriter is available for
hire?</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Yes - he didn’t take it well.</p>

QUARTERS, carrying</p>

<p><strong>choy</strong>: Zoos … circus … Skipper get big money for rare
animal. Careful! Camel have bad accident on floor. Stain unremovable

<p><strong>englehorn</strong>: Choy!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: CHOY clams up as ENGLEHORN strolls into
the hold.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Spoilt for choice.</p>
<p><strong>englehorn</strong>: What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or a
chimpanzee?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe, I’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>englehorn</strong>: I told you to lock it up.</p>
<p><strong>choy</strong>: Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -</p>

JIMMY’S HAND and clatters to the floor. QUICK as an eel, JIMMY scampers

<p><strong>ack</strong>: No, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: It’s just he likes it down here, it’s where I
found him … four years ago … stowed away in one of them cages. His arm
was broken in two places, he was wilder than half the animals in here.
Still won’t tell me where he came from - all I know, it wasn’t any place
good.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: JIMMY is sorting NETS up on DECK. Nearby
HAYES rests against the railing.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: You gotta straighten up. You don’t want to be
on this ship for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: No, you don’t, Jimmy. You wanna get yourself
educated. Give yourself some options. Take this serious.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I’ve been

if you don’t mind me saying - you don’t look at all like your photograph

Mate?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s assuming she knows who the First Mate
is.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann
is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was joking, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>denham</strong>: The point is: she’s horrified. She has to
look away. And that’s when she sees it.</p>

snuck down in to the HOLD …</p>

<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s just a little humor, Bud - what are you,
a Bolshevik or something?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Actors. They travel the world but all they
ever see is a mirror!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: JACK - taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good legs.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I know, it wasn’t what you wrote. But Mr Baxter
felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman - then he must ignore
her. And if things turn really hostile … no?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Interesting theory.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I know … I should have -</p>
