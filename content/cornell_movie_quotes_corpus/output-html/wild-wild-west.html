BROS. Burbank, California 91522 All Rights Reserved</p>
<p><strong>morton</strong>: Madman… Hideous spider… Run… Run! Warn the
President…</p>
<p><strong>morton</strong>: Noooooooo!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: The legendary Captain James West and I
finally got him all to myself.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s right, sugar, and you should feel free
to treat him just bad.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: General McGrath’s boys. I thought y’all was
never gonna show up.</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: Mister West, you wouldn’t be here
workin’ tonight, now would you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: No, no. ’Course not. Not tonight. Would you be
working if you were up here with you?</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: I’m sorry. That won’t be possible. I have…
tonsillitis.</p>
<p><strong>big reb</strong>: Pack’er up good, Virgil. Next stop
N’Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Ah, this hole is a safety issue. I’m thinking,
what if it starts to rain and the water level goes up. It could suck you
right up. I’m protecting you.</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: Problem solved.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Belle, you don’t just ram a man’s
underbritches into a knothole. You wanna plug the hole, you ram your own
britches in there.</p>
<p><strong>saloon girl</strong>: Oh, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Much as I’d like to take credit for that you
might need to hand me my gun…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … Hand me my gun.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Okay, who just made a wish? Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I could sure use those clothes now.</p>
<p><strong>big reb</strong>: Well, we got us a shy nig…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Fought five long years with the Union Army not
to hear that word again. And you boys lost, remember?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: How ’bout some pants!?</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: My employer, here in a brothel? That would
be quite… redundant.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: You’ll meet him when the time – and place –
are appropriate. Now… … shall we go upstairs to check the
‘merchandise’?</p>
<p><strong>eye-crossed reb</strong>: You drive a hard bargain, lady. All
right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and…</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: Still not interested.</p>
<p><strong>eye-crossed reb</strong>: But you gotta be interested. You’re
a whore.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: That doesn’t mean a girl can’t have high
standards.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Could I have a little privacy here?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’ll have to excuse me, darlin’… but my
evidence is getting away.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sorry about there not being any towels.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: Dora. Would you like to go
upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>eye-crossed reb</strong>: Hey, c’mere! Who the hell are you
anyway?!</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: A ditty? But General… … my talents
really lay elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: ‘Buy a drink for the boys In the
backroom for me…’</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon full of
nitro…!</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: ‘And tell them I tried… And tell them I
cried…’</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Whoa now…!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I said, whoa!!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well, well, this is workin’ out to be a
perfect day. My man…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … General Bloodbath McGrath.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/crowd</strong>: And tell them I tried just the
same…!</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: Well, that’s a new one.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: Oh really. One can hardly notice… Would
you mind…? I… I… can’t seem to release the clasp of my belt.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: It’s a deep, deep pool. Maybe your old
swimmin’ hole. Getting sleepy, General?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Good. You’re going to be my little doggy.
And when I say ‘speak,’ you tell me everything I want to know.
Understood?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: All right, little doggy. Sit up. Now tell me
who’s in the sack next door. Is it the scientist, Dr. Escobar?
Speak!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me the name of
the man you kidnapped him for…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Watch the swirling spiral! Lie down, bad
dog!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Didn’t mean to startle you, ma’am. Looked like
you could use some help.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Looks can be deceivin’… dark stranger. I am
perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I can see that, darlin’. Woman of your caliber
probably gets top dollar, too. So here you go. You can run along. I’ll
take care of McGrath.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/dora</strong>: No! I need him!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: C’mon, lady. You got the money. Have a little
dignity.</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Get Escobar out of here!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Leave him right there.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Let’s go, Hudson… hands!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Thank… you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: U.S. Army… Now get outta my way, lady!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m no lady! I’m a U.S. Marshal! You get out
of my way!</p>
<p><strong>lippenreider</strong>: Get out of my way… get out of my way…
U.S. Army… U.S. Marshal.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Oh, dear…</p>
<p><strong>hudson</strong>: Federal agents inside, sir!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: So Miss Lippenreider informs me. Still, I
believe good manners dictate we should send out…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … the welcome wagon.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So now what…?</p>
<p><strong>house detective</strong>: Whoa there, ‘pardner.’ Winning the
war may have got you forty acres and a mule, but you can’t just traipse
into the President’s office. Now gimme that gun.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: This gun?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Or this one?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Don’t make Captain West any later
for his appointment than he already is!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Been a lot of death threats lately
… Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives. Drink, cigar?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I hear you let General McGrath get
away?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sir, I had him right in my hands when some
half-a-sissy wearin’ a dress ruined…</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Artemus Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You… know him?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Of course I know him, he’s the best
marshal I’ve got! He’s a genius. Gordon has proven himself time and
again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect. Nothing
will stop him from completing a mission for his President… except the
impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I am the President of the United
States!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Wrong answer. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I am the President of… … I’m
Artemus Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The President went to West Point … not
Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Will somebody tell me what the hell
this stunt is all about!?!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sir, in perilous times like these, I was
simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk
right into the very bowels of the White House…</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: You’re clever, Gordon. One day
it’ll get you killed.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: … And you, West – not every
situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later,
shoot again – then when they’re all dead, try to ask a question or two.
Working together will be good for both of you.</p>
<p><strong>west and gordon</strong>: But, sir, I work…</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: You work the way your Commander In
Chief tells you to work.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Ten of our country’s best
scientists… all kidnapped in the last year. By General McGrath, it now
seems. The fact is, gentlemen, you’ve both been working on the same case
all along. Why did it take you so long to realize it?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well, sir, one of us was still trying to
figure out if he was a man or a woman.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I don’t have time for this
bickering! One week, if we’re to believe this…</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: ’General Grant, the scientists that
you seek are in my employ –</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: – Creating a weapons system beyond
the pale of contemporary imagination. History and justice are on my
side. I suggest you put your affairs in order. You have one week before
you will surrender the U.S. Government.’</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: This letter was delivered inside
this.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Marzipan, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s McGrath, sir. The South is rising again.
I’m gonna stop it.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sir, West’s obsession aside, McGrath may be
a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not. So whom do we seek? After
consulting with Intelligence…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: McGrath’s headed for New Orleans. The longer
we stand here talkin’, the farther away he gets. I don’t need
‘Intelligence’ to tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Ah, so that would mean you rely on …
Stupidity?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Gentlemen! I’m leaving today for
Utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at Promontory
Point.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: For the first time the United
States will truly be united. Someone wants us divided. Now look, you two
are the best I’ve got. Put aside your differences and stop this madman…
whoever he is. If you fail, well… we may never know how great this
country could’ve been. You have a week. Dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The President has put a private train at your
disposal. Engine number five, track six. Mr. Gordon, the item you
requested.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I call it the Bi-axle Nitro- Combust…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Save it. I’ve gotta train to catch.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yee-haaa!!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Avant!!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Stop this train!! You hear me!?!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Thanks for dropping in.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake
boobies. Put down the needlepoint and let’s settle this like men!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: As a matter of clarification, this isn’t
needlepoint. This is.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Right now, I’m putting the final touches on
a new invention of my creation. I call it… The Impermeable. It’s a vest
that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired
even at close range.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: But it hasn’t been really tested empirically
yet.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Get up!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Guns. I find them so primitive and
unnecessary… if one has done one’s proper planning.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yeah? How do you feel about a fist?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I must tell you, Mr. West, I’ve always felt
that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a
failure on my part.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well then, ‘Mr.’ Gordon, you failed.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. West, you brought this on
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I love this train!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The President asked for my suggestions on
how to make the Wanderer both comfortable and functional…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: And while you’re down there, you may want to
avail yourself of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail Egressor…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Only one doin’ any ‘egressin’ is gonna be
you.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Perhaps the President was right about us
putting aside our petty differences.</p>
<p>****: ‘The opposite is beneficial, from things that differ comes the
fairest attunement.’ Aristotle.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Knock each other about all ya please, but
harm my train and I’ll douse ya like dogs.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s my veal reduction sauce!</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Well then, let’s get on about our business,
shall we, gentlemen? Now, where to?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Shall we let Professor Morton decide?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton, expert in
the field of metallurgy … discovered in a field of alfalfa. Kidnapped
from M.I.T. six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s a man’s head!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: … And this magnetic collar was around it
when his body was discovered. Haven’t figured that one out yet…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s a man’s head.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: According to the Retinal Terminus Theory… a
dying person’s last conscious image is burned into the back of the
eyeball like a photograph. Perhaps there’s a clue there…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Morton’s last image!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s a man’s head!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Ah. The refraction of the lenses causes the
image to appear upside down. We simply…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s McGrath. I was right all along.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He seems to have something in his pocket…
too fuzzy to read, though…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Mortification of the aqueous humor seems to
have led to the loss of…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … glasses.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: ‘Friends of the South! Come to a Surprise
Costume Ball. April 14, eight-thirty. 346 Garden Street…’ Like I said….
New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: How about this? You could come as my man
servant?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: How about this? You could come as my man
servant.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what I’ll do. And
I’ll jus’ smile and do as I’s tole so those people won’ ever know that I
would rather shoot myself in the head than play your god damned man
servant!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I have a horse costume. You could be the
head.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The only thing I need to wear is this.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Okay, if you insist on carrying a firearm, I
have something I think you’ll find intriguing…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: And it would go nicely with this…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Jim West does not wear a dress.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Then what’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: How ’bout this: I’ll go as a government agent
who’s gonna kill McGrath.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: An armed, Negro cowboy costume, how
creative. In a room full of white Southerners, you oughtta fit right in.
You might even win first prize!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Listen to me. The art of disguise is what’s
going to get us into that party, thus allowing us to find these
kidnapped scientists before they’re forced to create something that will
destroy this great country.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now you and I are the chosen ones, Jim.
We’re under direct orders from the President himself. And our mission is
clear: Save our country. Our freedom is at stake and this is our duty as
men. Now, you go as a riverboat captain and I’ll be a saloon girl.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Let me tell you a little something about
beloved ‘art of disguise’… That night at Fat-Can’s, I knew you weren’t a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: But I was propositioned by three men.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon, you looked nasty. Your breasts were
all hard and stiff, and were sticking straight out like two rusty
cannons on a sunken ship.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: These are a work of art. Scientifically and
aesthetically perfect.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: They look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Touch them.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I don’t wanna touch ’em. I can see I don’t
like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What, are you afraid you’re wrong? Touch my
breasts.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: I knew it. Well, I’ll have no part of
it!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: There, Gordon, you happy? I’m touching your
breasts.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Not so rough. The buckwheat’ll come out.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Buckwheat? That’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now, squeeze this. This is what a breast
should feel like.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Whoa…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Isn’t that nice?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now touch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You win. I’m hard.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Federal officers, bah!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I was just going to jot down a thought.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You know something, that’s a good place to put
a gun.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: But then, where would I keep my notepad.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You know, Artemus, I think you underestimate
the convenience of a pocket.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got about as much chance of havin’ an
invitation as him.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Matter of fact, got it right here.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey… get your hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Put me in the dungeon with all those smelly,
dirty bearded men … but I am not goin’ in there.</p>
<p><strong>amazonia</strong>: You applied for the position.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah, a standing up position. I’m an
entertainer, not a…</p>
<p><strong>miss lippenreider</strong>: Do not be selfish and stupid. He
always spoils his new girl.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yeah. Well gimme a simple diamond bracelet
instead of that…</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: It is not so bad… once the metal warms
up.</p>
<p><strong>sultry woman</strong>: An authentic cowboy outfit… complete
with six-guns!</p>
<p><strong>dragon lady</strong>: What a terribly clever costume,
Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … West. Jim West.</p>
<p><strong>dragon lady</strong>: Well… West meets East. Mae Lee East.
Are you here alone, Mr. West?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Actually I’m, uh trying to surprise an old
friend – General McGrath. Seen him around anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: I don’t believe that name was on our
guest list. And I would know. I’m Dr. Loveless’s personal assistant.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Dr. Arliss Loveless…? One of the great
founders of the Confederacy with Jefferson Davis. Funny how most people
think he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: Tonight’s his coming-out party.</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: See anybody that looks familiar?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Matter of fact, I do.</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: I’m… jealous. Meet me later… in the
foyer.</p>
<p><strong>distaff corps</strong>: ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the
coming of the Lord…’</p>
<p><strong>distaff corps</strong>: ‘He has trampled down the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored!’</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Don’t you just hate that song?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Why, y’all look like you’ve seen a ghost!
It’s me, dear friends, alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: We may’ve lost the war, but heaven knows…
we haven’t lost our sense of humor!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Not even when we’ve lost a lung… a spleen…
a bladder… two legs… thirty-five feet of small intestine and our ability
to reproduce… All in the name of the South… … do we lose our sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my
friends across the sea for their comfort and… succor.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: So…! Mi casa es su casa! Ma maison est a
vous! Let the party begin!!!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Mr. West, how nice of you to join us
tonight… and add color to these monochromatic proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well, when a man comes back from the dead,
it’s an occasion to stand and be counted.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Miss East informs me that you were
expecting to meet General McGrath here. I knew him years ago… but
haven’t seen him in a coon’s age.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I bet a man like yourself would find it
difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you
from being a slave to your disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well, you know beautiful women… they encourage
you one second, cut the legs out from under you the next.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hey, honey… I see a big ole spider up on the
wall. Hope it doesn’t drop down your pretty dress.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Peeking through the keyhole…? So 18th
Century.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Your men will have their weapons tonight.
And my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory
of this century!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: And so you shall. Have your men here at…
10 o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: I said to meet me in the foyer.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I’ve never been much
good at French.</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: Au contraire…</p>
<p><strong>miss east</strong>: So let’s see, Mr. West… are you a
dangerous spy of some sort? Or just a handsome cowboy who likes to… poke
around.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Um… that second one.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Howdy there… big sturdy gal. Yer dance card
full?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Thanks for helpin’ me get to the bottom of
this case.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Real impressed the way you got the dance floor
staked out. Maybe one of your missin’ scientists’ll cut in. Thought you
should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear
tonight… I found that our host, Dr. Loveless…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … is meeting McGrath and his troops at
Malheureux Point in an hour. So you enjoy the party. I’m gonna go save
the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: But I will say, good work on your bladders
tonight… they’re damn perky.</p>
<p><strong>gordon/mountain man</strong>: Hang him!</p>
<p><strong>george washington</strong>: Looks like we’re gonna have to
teach y’all a little lesson on how to behave in polite society.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Don’t grab a white lady’s boobies at the big
redneck dance. Is that the lesson? Well, I learned it. Don’t scratch
your head with the shrimp fork. I got that one too. So whaddaya say we
call this off?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I feel as if we know each other from
someplace…?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Try again, buster…!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Ma’am, please! While I realize I look like
something straight out of James Fenimore Cooper… I mean you no harm. My
name is Artemus Gordon. And you look like you’re in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m Rita. I was hired here as an entertainer.
Not that I’m complaining, but what are you doin’ in here?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Looking for some missing scientists… not
that I’m complaining.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m a special U.S. Marshal on assignment
from the President.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: If you’re so special, how come you’re lookin’
up here when Loveless has ‘em all workin’ down in the dungeon? Get me
out of here and I’ll take you down there.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Too late. The ‘dungeon’ is cleaned out. It
was the first place I checked, right after I sampled the gumbo. Bit
heavy on the okra.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Thank you… Artemus, was it?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: One doesn’t forget a smile like that. Now
where in the world was it…? Have you ever played the Empire Room… the
Bijou Cafe perhaps…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Can I have everyone’s attention please. I
think we’ve had a series of major misunderstandings and I’d like to take
a moment to clear them up. First, the whole drumming on the boobies
thing. In my native land, Africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate
between villages. I’m sure y’all can see that this young girl here can
communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on a clear day, we
might even get Galveston. All I was saying was, ‘How’re you doing,’ ‘My
name’s Jim,’ ‘How’s your mama?’</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Second misunderstanding. That redneck comment.
I’m getting the sense that some of you took that negatively. You know,
some of my best friends are whiskey-guzzling, pot-bellied rednecks just
like y’all here. That slavery thing, I don’t see what the big deal was.
Hell, who wouldn’t want somebody to run around for them doing chores.
Are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning
and pick your own damn cotton. I don’t think so. Let’s head on inside
and knock back some shine. Come on, back inside. No. Okay. I stand
before you as a man who realizes he has done something wrong and I am
prepared to do the right thing. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ll take that as a no. Darling, would it help
at all if I said I thought you were a man?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>george washington</strong>: Hang him!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hey-yaa!!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hang ’m…!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hang’m!?!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Meet my trigger-happy partner, James West…
who doesn’t seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me
the opportunity to search for the missing scientists.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Scientist, huh.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: This is Rita. I found her locked in a cage
in Loveless’s bedroom. She’s an entertainer.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Um, maybe I haven’t been quite honest about
that… My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the
scientist, my… father.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Professor Escobar?! He was the one I almost
rescued that night when… That’s where I know you from! Fat-Can Candy’s…
you sang before I did.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That was me. Burgundy dress with the
bustle…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Look, Rita, I’m sorry you had the wrong agent
working on your case. When I find your father I promise I’ll send him
back safely…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He’s impulsive, James.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, General, it’s been a long journey
from New Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Yes, and so do I. So do I. If I’d only had
the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that I have
today…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Oh, you mean the stomach-churning carnage
that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: What was that nickname again?</p>
<p><strong>reb #1</strong>: They oughta be here by now.</p>
<p><strong>reb #2</strong>: Maybe we’re in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>reb #1</strong>: No, we’re supposed to wait ’xactly on this
here spot.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: My dear General, after donating half my
physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this… how did you and
General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So, who
betrayed whom?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Munitia, make note. Turret speed needs to
be accelerated!</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!</p>
<p><strong>amazonia</strong>: A bucket for the minister, please!</p>
<p><strong>lippenreider</strong>: Scream. Scream. My head. I’m dying.
Scream. Moan. Scream.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … We’re going to need more loading drills!
I’m hearing too much time between screams.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: General, I understand your distress. But
believe me, those men are not dying senselessly. It is for a far greater
cause than you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: After you… sir.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Bloodbath McGrath indeed.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, that concludes the festivities.
Ladies, feed him to the crabs.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: But, my friends, that tank is just a
little ol’ toy compared to what this country’s greatest scientists are
cooking up for me next. So if I’ve piqued your interest, bring 1000
kilograms of your country’s gold to Spider Canyon four days from now.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a tank to catch.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: My destination is both the future… and the
past! Forget Paul Revere, this will be the most revolutionary ride in
the history of America!!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: If you don’t want to miss the ride, have
the last payment of 1000 kilograms of your country’s gold in my hands no
later than Friday. That’s when I make our little proposal to President
Grant. One I’m ever so confident he’s gonna accept. Au revoir, adios,
and ta-ta!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It came up out of the lake… from the way
these corpses are positioned, laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon
fire… then disappeared in moments. My God, what kind of weapon is
it?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Excuse me, I think I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It just rolls on and on. Makes a screeching
sound – like a wounded animal. Got a ‘cabin’ on top with a cannon…
swivels ’round like an eagle’s head.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You saw it?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Heard about it. Thought it was crazy
survivors’ stories.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What survivors? There aren’t any here.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: New Liberty, Illinois – the free slave town
just over the border. Just one week before the War ended in ’65. I was
in the 9th Cavalry that discovered it. Old men, women, children… they
used them for target practice…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s when I vowed to follow McGrath to the
end of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I was hoping to kill you myself.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: That’s a nice way to talk to people.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Where is he? Where did he go?!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I know that.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll tell you if you take me along.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: The girls at the mansion. They talk. ‘I vonder
if my hair vill get frissy in ze desert…? Vhere is diss Ooo-tah
anyvay?’</p>
<p><strong>west/gordon</strong>: Ooo-tah?!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Coleman… let’s go! Full speed ahead!</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Aye, sir!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t see why we couldn’t have given her a
ride back home to Texas. It is on the way…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: On the way to Utah where our President happens
to be. Maybe we oughta be worryin’ about that little coincidence!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We wouldn’t have known where Loveless was
going if it wasn’t for her. Seems a bit ungracious. Possibly
perilous.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Look, all that would happen would be she’d get
in our way and I’d probably wind up gettin’ in the saddle with her.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Funny that you say that. Because I thought
she was more interested in me.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You know, I’ve been trying to place myself
in Loveless’s shoes…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Good luck on that one.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Ha, ha, ha… You know, I can’t imagine what
Loveless – a man without any reproductive organs could possibly want
with Rita.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Not that Rita doesn’t have a figure that
would inspire a Botticelli… or a Raphael.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: … especially her breasts. Did you notice the
way one of them… Both of them actually… to say nothing of her
buttocks…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: … and the group of foreign ministers at
Loveless’s party… What were they doing there?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Here’s France, Spain and Britain… How long
has she been here?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Since the first breast.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I am so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ll spare you. Make yourself a sandwich to
take with you. You’re getting off.</p>
<p><strong>83 omitted 83</strong>: &amp; &amp; 84 84</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: But… I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: How could you possibly help us?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I heard you talking about why all those
foreign guys were at Loveless’s party…? You want me to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is fantastic. You can cut it with a fork!
How’d you cook it?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well, in a daubiere… a clay pot. A French
method which…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What about the foreign guys?!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: They were mad about something, you know?
Something about a real bad deal in Louisiana on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The Louisiana Purchase?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And Queen somebody-somebody of France got
swindled.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Queen Isabella of Spain.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon, this is crazy. She doesn’t know what
she’s talking about!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Coleman, stop the train! Miss Escobar’s
getting off.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Who the hell’s Miss Escobar?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m a frightened, starving, half- naked young
woman who only wants to find her father!</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Half-naked?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Coleman… stop the train.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: We’re not puttin’ anybody off. Not out here
in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Please, Jim. My father’s the only family I’ve
got. What am I supposed to do? Sit home and wait for news he’s been
killed? Or go do something! What would you do, Jim?!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Look, I got nothing against you, Rita. It’s
just that… What’s going to happen when we catch up to Loveless… with you
on the train?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I know you’d never let him take me back. I’ve
seen you shoot.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I assure you, Rita, an attack by Loveless
would be an exercise in futility. … Allow me to demonstrate how my
design suggestions have made the Wanderer impervious to attack.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’m the impervious part.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hardly. Completely armor- plated…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: An attacker would find the lighting inside
extremely… unflattering.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: And if, by some inconceivable fluke, they
did manage to gain entrance… An innocent billiard ball this way. But
depress the number… a sleeping gas bomb. Effective in under three
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: So rest assured, Rita… you are completely
safe within these walls.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I don’t know about you, ma’am, but I know I’ll
be sleeping a whole lot better tonight… … assuming Loveless barges in
here and feels like a game of pool.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Speaking of sleeping, I’m pretty tired.
Artemus, do you think I could borrow something to wear?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I’ve got somethin’ you might use. It ain’t
stylish, but it’s practical…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Loveless kidnapped two chemists, that means
there’s gonna be explosives. He’s got a metallurgist, so there’s gonna
be heavy armor. And he’s got Rita’s father, who – according to you – is
the world’s foremost specialist in hydraulics. Which means, whatever it
is… it’s gonna move.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So what, is he building that’s gonna make the
President fall to his knees and surrender the country?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: A bedside heater.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Rita. She needs a bedside heater. I mean, it
gets cold in there, you know, with the stained glass window right over
the –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Such a pleasant girl. A real breath of fresh
ass.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You said ass.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Did I? No…</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: We have Loveless, gentlemen! Seven hundred
yards and closing!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Stay back here, take cover!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I took the liberty of installing it while
you were sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Leave my stuff alone!</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Am I missin’ somethin’ here…?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Amazonia, shall we disabuse our friends of
the notion that one’s problems are solved when we see the light at the
end of the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>94 omitted 94</strong>: thru thru 97 97</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Jim, we’re the ones chasing Loveless,
correct? Then perhaps you could explain what they’re doing behind
us.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: They couldn’t fire the cannon at us from in
front. Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Would it put you out too much to throw me a
rope and hit your little secret button?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I taught him how it worked.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You know you could put a gun on that
thing.</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: I have them square in my sights, sire.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: As do I, Munitia… as do I. Fire away!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Close the fire door!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I won’t let Loveless take me again! I’d rather
be dead!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s not a good one to wish for.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Please, Artemus, don’t leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: It’s me, Jim. Open up!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s a trick, I know Loveless.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Rita, no! It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Too damn late, is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: An innocent billiard ball this way, but
depress the number and on impact… a sleeping-gas bomb.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Continue, Miss Lippenreider…</p>
<p><strong>miss lippenreider</strong>: West. Let go of my leg! Gordon.
Listen to me. Loveless collared us with the same metal device we found
on Morton.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Oh, Munitia… I hope we’re not going to
leave evidence behind like we did last time.</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: Nitro this time, sire.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen! I trust you slept
well.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What have you done with Rita?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita is
sleeping off the after-effects in the stateroom. Quite lovely, isn’t
she? Who knows… I might even become ‘familiar’ with her myself.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: And that would become one more reason why I’m
going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Yes, Mr. West, I’m sure a well- endowed
blackamoor like yourself must find it absolutely impossible… that a
freak like me could fully enjoy the pleasure of a woman. But having
witnessed my use of mechinology so far… wouldn’t you think I could
provide myself with something for the lower half of my body that was
hard-pumping and indefatigably steely?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … And speaking of ‘hard pumping…’
Mr. Coleman, full steam ahead!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: What a marvelous train! You don’t mind if
I borrow it, do you, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Other than a lack of wheelchair access, I
find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my
laboratory in Spider Canyon… I’ll be seeing President Grant soon at
Promontory Point. What shall I tell him for you? I’m afraid it can’t be
that you’re alive and well…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon, get out your little tool kit and get
this damn thing off of me!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘Gentlemen, welcome to the Loveless
Experimental Camp for Political Dissidents. There are no guards. No
barbed wire. As long as you stay within the designated perimeter, you
will stay alive.’</p>
<p><strong>miss lippenreider</strong>: West. How do you know it’s not
just bullshit? Gordon. Step over the fence and find out. Rita and I will
put flowers on your grave every year.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Wait, I have an auxiliary tool kit!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: See? Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh, really…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Is it too late to take it off of me now?</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: Caviar…?</p>
<p><strong>lippenreider</strong>: Blini…?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Rita, my dear, not that I’m ungrateful to
Providence for bringing you back to me…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … I’m just a wee bit curious as to how you
managed to wind up with them.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, they uh… seemed so… sure that they could
find you… and I thought if I stayed with them… they’d lead me back to…
all my friends…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And not to give you a big head but… I kinda
missed you.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Isn’t that a coincidence? I miss me,
too.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Head for that gully!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: When I give the signal. Jump off the cliff
into my arms.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Are you crazy?! Do you see what’s down
there?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Five, four, three, two…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Forget it. I’m not doing it…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: One…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I just remembered… I can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You won’t have to!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Maybe I should have stayed inside that fence
another moment or two.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: All right, Gordon, what’s your plan? How are
you gonna get this damn thing off my neck?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Isn’t that why you’re here? ’Cause you’re the
master of, you know, mechanical stuff?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh. Oh, I see. Now I’m the master of…
‘mechanical stuff.’ As opposed to five minutes ago, when I was trying to
collect my thoughts and figure out a way to get us out of these
contraptions! But no!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: – That wouldn’t have been any fun for a
certain somebody, and I won’t mention any names – Jim West! – who
decided to take me on a bracing romp through a cornfield and play a
fanciful game of hide and seek with serrated, spinning death discs,
while our only mode of transportation is in the hands of a sadistic
madman with weapons of mass destruction, who kidnapped Rita, and is on
his way to kill our President and take over the country!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hey, calm down, Gordon…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No! Because I’m the ‘Master of Mechanical
Stuff!’ And I have to help YOU! Because you’re the ‘Master of Stupid
Stuff!’</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You want to get that collar off? Fine! Let’s
do it the fun, Jim West way! Let’s bash it with a rock!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon, you don’t want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh, but I do.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s odd. What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I didn’t do shit!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No, you must’ve reversed the polarity of the
magnets.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I did not do shit! That’s it –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Oh, I’m peachey. Now help me get my boot
off!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Ahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Apologies, apologies.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Do me a favor. When you’re telling this story
to your grandkids, leave this part out.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now, when I undo your belt, I’m going to run
as fast as I can that way, and you run as fast as you can the other way.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You’re going to run as fast as you can one
way and I’m going to run as fast as I can the other…? Ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: One… two… Three!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Get off me, you steaming pile of</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m trying, you son of a !</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: you!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: yourself!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I do not want to spend the rest of my life
looking like a meatball on a plate.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We’re going to have to discuss bathroom
etiquette soon. Very soon.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Aha. My auxiliary tool kit. I forgot all
about it. It must’ve slipped out of my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Your pocket? Why wasn’t it attached to some
spring-loaded something-or-other that shoots out of your ass?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Because that, my friend, would be
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me you had an ‘auxiliary’
tool kit?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I did tell you, but in your zeal to run and
leap off a two-hundred- foot cliff, I don’t think you heard me.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: ‘… Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel
what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them, And
show the heavens more just.’</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You know, Gordon, you can be quite annoying –
flaunting that fancy education.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well, truth be told, I never had a fancy
education – not a formal one, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The Harvard thing seems pretty formal to
me.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: This ring? This ring isn’t real. Do you want
it?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: A prop. I’m an actor. Or was. I gave it up.
I went by the name of Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: No. How did you wind up in this line of
work?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The pinnacle of my life in the theater came
in a production of Our American Cousin – a light comedy – at Ford’s
Theater in Washington. There was this one line I had… always got the
biggest laugh in the show. One night, it drowned out the gunshot that
killed President Lincoln. I decided to devote my talents to making sure
that never happened again.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Uh… There’s a spider on your hand. Doesn’t
that bother you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: She doesn’t want any trouble. She’s just
trying to get warm.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: How come you know so much about the desert,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The Indians taught me. I lived out here when I
was a boy.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hey – watch –</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: The desert wasp… one of the world’s great
hunters. She’ll kill the tarantula – and lay her eggs on it, so her
babies can have something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now I’m really hungry. How did your parents,
who I assume were Negroes, feel about you being raised by Indians?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: They didn’t have much to say about it. I was
sent to another plantation when I was little. Ran away as soon as my
legs were strong enough to take me.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Did you ever see your family again?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yeah… They were at the camp at New
Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’ll help you get him, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You have no idea where you’re going, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I know exactly where I’m goin’ … Spider
Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: But I’m never gonna get there with you
draggin’ that damn thing around!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: While a magneto of this power may not
inspire your scientific curiosity, it does mine. Besides, you never know
when it might come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Arte… when you’re right, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well I think our partnership is taking a big
step forward. You finally admitted I was right about something.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now… how about admitting you were lost?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Don’t push it.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Jim, I know I’ve hallucinated it several
times before, so is that really the Wanderer?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That’s the Wanderer.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: And would it be too much to hope that I’m
simply seeing a World’s Fair down there… ?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yeah, it would. That’s Loveless’ Lair.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now that’s impressive.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Nice to see an invention that actually
works.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We’ll see about that. The fool doesn’t even
realize he’s trapped.</p>
<p><strong>146 omitted 146</strong>: &amp; &amp; 147 147</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gordon, let’s ride! You do know how to
ride…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: … A horse, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yes… I know how to ride a horse. When the
situation calls for something primitive.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: How about now? There’s a big spider stompin’
towards our President!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I was just thinking about another spider.
Remember in the desert, when that little wasp killed the tarantula…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small advantage. It
could fly.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci invented a flying
machine called the ‘Ornithopter.’ Though he never actually flew it…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Artemus! There’s no time for plans or
half-cocked inventions! They don’t work. We gotta stick to what we’re
each good at!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: May God continue the unity of our
country…</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: … as this railroad unites the two
great oceans of this world.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, isn’t this a coincidence! I’m out
for a little mornin’ ride, and right in the middle of nowhere, I bump
into General Ulysses S. Grant himself! We’ve never been properly
introduced. I’m Dr. Arliss Loveless, formerly with the Confederate
Army.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do
for you today? Flank him, left and right.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I have a humble abode nearby, and I hope
you’ll accept my hospitality. I have a little proposition to make.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: What proposition is that?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: The unconditional and immediate surrender
of the United States of America to the Loveless Alliance.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I didn’t realize we were at
war.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: How about now…?</p>
<p><strong>gordon/grant</strong>: In matters of war, the person to talk
to would be me.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Now just who are you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon/grant</strong>: The President. He’s just an actor
hired to stand in for me on public occasions. A very bad actor, I must
say… a little puffy and overweight.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Gordon, you’ve got a lot of brass.
Where’s West?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You know him, sir…</p>
<p><strong>gordon/grant</strong>: Captain, get this man out of my sight!
And next time get me a real actor!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Take them both!!!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Well, Gordon… was this part of your
plan?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m by your side, sir. That’s what’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>168 omitted 168</strong>: &amp; &amp; 169 169</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Bonjour, buenas tardes and good day! Great
glorious day! A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us
all!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … Oh, how long have we waited!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … 1776, wasn’t it, old bean? Most
expensive cup o’ tea in history…!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Manhattan for a handful of beads? How?
Remember the Alamo indeed! Today I’m proud to be able to sit before you
and tell you the wrongs will be righted… the past made present… the
United, divided!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Great Britain gets back the thirteen
original colonies… minus Manhattan. Florida and the Fountain of Youth go
back to Spain! Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona revolve a Mexico!
And the Louisiana Purchase reverts back to the King of France!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Queen of Spain. King of France. I was
close.</p>
<p><strong>munitia</strong>: Shut up and listen to a real genius!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: And a tiny piece for me to retire on.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: My partner nations insist that we make
this as legal as possible. Personally, I like the symmetry of it. After
all wasn’t it you who made us sign a surrender at Appomattox?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Never will I sign that paper, never
will the United States ever surrender!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, sir, we’re at loggerheads then,
aren’t we? And I suppose the threat of death to someone with your
valorous war record, would mean nothing.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: … so, if you still refuse to sign this
surrender… we’ll start by shooting your man, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Artemus!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m wearing the
Impermeable.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: If I may have one request… it’s that she aim
at my heart… which has loved this great country so much!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Shoot him in the head.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ‘Ohhh… Hangtown gals are plump and
rosy…’</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ‘Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy…’</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: A new girl! What a nice surprise!</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ‘Painted cheeks and frilly corsets.’
Touch them…’</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ‘… And they’ll sting like hornets!’</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to me?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I have a dress like that.</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ’Hangtown gals are lovely Think they’ll
marry Mormon</p>
<p><strong>chanteuse</strong>: ‘Heads thrown back to show their
features…’</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Go, Ebonia, go.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Ha… Ha… Hangtown girls…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Not to sound ungrateful, but you’re a little
over the top.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Ha… Ha… Ha…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Let me warn you about that dress…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Gotta go. Big finish… ‘Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown
gals!!!’</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Where’d those come from…?</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Captain West.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She’s… no…!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: ‘Ha, ha, ha… Hang… Town… Girls!!!’</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Wait a minute. What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Serves you right for staring at them.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Kill him! Him! Him! The girl!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Was that the eight ball?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That one’s an incendiary bomb.</p>
<p><strong>west/gordon</strong>: Rita!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Meet me after the show!</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Special Marshal… President thought you
needed some lookin’ after.</p>
<p><strong>french minister</strong>: Monsieur, we are your partners! You
can’t let us die in this fire!!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: It’s not the first time y’all have been
burned in America.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: This is diabolical! They’ve got the
President and I’ve still got that silly song in my head!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: C’mon we gotta go! We gotta ride horse!
Something!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: No, Arte. Right now, we need a plan.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: That flyin’ machine idea of yours… were you
just acting like you knew what you were talking about… or could you
build it?</p>
<p><strong>182 omitted 182</strong>: &amp; &amp; 183 183</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now Bernoulli’s Principle states that the
air flowing over a bird’s wings… is moving at a lower pressure than the
pressure below the wing… that’s called ‘lift.’ Course, it’s just a
theory… it’s never been tested.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You’re not makin’ me feel any better.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Here’s a coupla bon voyage presents.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Coleman! Must you smoke when handling
explosives!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: He’s just a little nervous ’cause no one’s
ever flown before.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Avant…! Avant!!!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We’re not getting enough lift! We need more
speed!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Hey, uh… that’s the cliff over there, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yes, I do know.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It worked…? It worked!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: If you had to get one right, I’m real glad it
was this one.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeee-haaa!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Mr. President, I’ll ask you once again.
Sign the surrender or I decimate this town!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: You’ve had my answer.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I find the sound of people screaming while
they get blown to smithereens, ruins the ear for music. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Commence firing!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I think I’ll call it…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Lemme guess… an Elevation Enhancer?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No, Air… Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Go down, down there!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You can’t just ‘go down there.’ Flight
depends on lift, which must be calibrated to the angle of descent…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Shut up and go down there, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, Mr. President. Have you had enough
yet? Would you like to sign the surrender or shall we set a course for
Denver? Wichita? Washington, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned… it’s West and
Gordon… flying!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Keep that surrender handy. I think
you’re going to need it!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Don’t be too sure…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I’m through with diplomacy… Take him away
and kill him!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: What does your boy da Vinci say about puttin’
this bird down?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t think he thought it would ever work,
so he didn’t get that far. I’m open to suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Take out as many bad guys out as you can.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Munitia! Munitia!!!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sorry about that, sir. Nose up, flaps down.
Have to remember that next time.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Son, never apologize for saving a
President’s life.</p>
<p><strong>amazonia</strong>: Soon you all can fly again. This time with
little angel wings.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by your
effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me… and forego
your executions.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Why not? Well, I guess maybe I’d rather see
what happens when I stuff your ass into that cannon up there and
fertilize the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Uh, Jim, I think a polite ‘no’ would
suffice…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Lippenreider, take over the controls. We
may not have a woodshed on board, but that boy is gonna get a whoopin’
anyway!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: So, I guess you’re the one who’s gonna give me
my whoopin’.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Pfft. I got one a’ those.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: But you’ve got two of those. Okay, lemme talk
to Gordon, I’ll see if he can…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: No more Mister Knife guy!</p>
<p><strong>shovel guy</strong>: I learned that from a Chinaman.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I just made that up.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Don’t forget your shovel!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Is that all you got for me, Loveless?!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Uh, I just threw my shovel out. So this really
isn’t fair. If you don’t mind, I’d like to…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Noooo.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>metal head</strong>: Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You guys just don’t get out enough.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: When you get right down to it, Loveless, you
just can’t beat a good pair of legs.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: You’re obviously not a poker player,
Mr. West…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Two pair always beats a pair.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Now… Was it someone particularly close to
you who perished in that military action?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Hmmm. Well, that hit a nerve.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: A mother, perhaps? A father?</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: It feels so good to stretch my legs.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I likes to beat my feet on the Mississippi
mud!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Stop this violence!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Drop ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Stop or I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: You expect to kill me with that little pea
shooter?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: If I have to. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Why is it, that I’m unafraid? I believe
you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and I’m stuck
in the middle. On one end, we have Mr. West, a man of primitive vigours
uncomplicated by intellect. And on the other, there’s Mr. Gordon. A man
of ideas, but unlike myself, lacks the passion to kill for them. He’d
like to be able to act his way out of it. And for some reason when he’s
actin’, someone always seems to get killed.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Shoot him, Gordon…!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: I’m right about you, aren’t I, Gordon? And
that’s why I’m gonna kill your friend here. Then I’m going to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: After all that, you missed.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Better than a fountain pen, don’t you think.
By the way, your chivalry’s about to be tested.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: We’ll be joining them in a moment
if you can’t stop that thing!</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Let’s see how clever you really
are…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: For almost four long years I’ve been trackin’
the animal responsible for the Massacre at New Liberty. And I hear
that’s you…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Please, West… show a little mercy to a
poor defenseless cripple…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now, now, Doctor… let’s not cloud this
otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol’-me-cripple-talk. Just buck up and
say to yourself, ‘I am indefatigably hard-pumpin’ and steely!’</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: After I kill ya, I swear I’m gonna boil
you down to axle grease!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now that’s the ol’ doctor I know!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Well, I’ll be a monkey’s uncle. How did we
arrive in this dark situation?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I don’t know. Guess I’m stumped!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: And I’m so cotton-pickin’ afraid of
heights. They just give me the spooks!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Ah, don’t be afraid, Loveless. With this being
the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you’re
really missing something.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Mister West, I’m gonna cut this
conversation short…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Good one, Loveless. I didn’t think of that
one.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Mister West!!! I am faced with a difficult
decision here. On one hand, there is the overwhelming love that I have
for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred I have for you!
Now, I could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever…</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: But, of course, I would die along with
you. I guess the only thing that I can take comfort in is the hope that
you would hit those rocks a second before me and I could enjoy
immeasurable bliss before I vanish. What to do, what to do…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Allow me to make that decision easy on you,
Loveless. Because I want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than I
want to live.</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Why is it that I have a sneaking
suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside…
inside, you are yellow?!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: You don’t have it in you, do you…
boy?!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You were right. Let’s cut this conversation
short!</p>
<p><strong>loveless</strong>: Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Now that looked like it hurt.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Gentlemen, I now strongly believe
the United States is going to be truly united. Not because of this
railroad… but because of you.</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I’ve signed into law the creation
of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the President and the country
from lunatics like Loveless. Welcome to the Secret Service, Agents No. 1
and No. 2.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Uh, just out of curiosity, sir… who’s Agent
No. 1?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: I don’t think that matters very
much, do you? Gordon? Besides, you’ll have plenty of time to discuss it
on your new assignment. See you back in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: But, sir… what about our train?</p>
<p><strong>president grant</strong>: Well, I’m taking it of course.
Hell, you let Loveless blow up mine.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Jim… Arte…?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Rita! You look great.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Ravishing, a vision.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I just wanted to thank you for everything
you’ve done for me… before I went back home to Texas.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Texas? Why’re you going back there? Why don’t
you come with me back to Washington?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Or better still, come with me to Washington.
I could introduce you to people I still know in the theater…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: She’s not really an entertainer, remember?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I can’t go with either of you.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s not that you both don’t have your
attributes. You’re so sophisticated and such a wonderful cook. Jim,
you’re good with a gun… and have great legs. And you’re both so brave.
But… I’m afraid I haven’t been completely honest with you.</p>
<p><strong>west and gordon</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Professor Escobar’s not my father. He’s my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Rita… why didn’t you just tell us that in the
first place?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, I was going to… but would you have
really brought me along if I said I was married? Honestly.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: At least you still have each other.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: You know, Arte…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What’s that, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Maybe Rita’s right…</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Besides… there’s a lot of other women in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s easy for you to say. She didn’t walk
off with your best dress.</p>
