<p><strong>revised draft</strong>: 10.12.05</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me…</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Marcus– I’m Doctor Serena Kogan, I’m with
Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, I’m pretty much done with it.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: You’ve been chosen for our research.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Chosen? Lucky me.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: We just need a couple of signatures…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You don’t need to be scared.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I’m not. It’s nerve degeneration.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Cancer?</p>
<p>****: You’re not the only one with a death sentence.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m a regular hero.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Thank you. And… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No one lives forever.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Marcus, this is your last opportunity to
make a confession…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What can I say. I was seventeen, I was
angry, I was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>team leader</strong>: You will not believe the shit we found
down here–</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: –repeat, that was not us! A ship escaped,
they musta blown the place themselves! Jesus, a lot of our guys were
still down there…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>memory montage</strong>: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic
POVs, blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey! Yo, over here!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey mister, where you goin’ in such a
hurry?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re human… you can see me, you can touch
me. This place is real.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: This sure ain’t heaven.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Those things with masks, red eyes–</p>
<p>****: Terminators– T-400s. What is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: If I’m not in hell, where am I?!</p>
<p>****: Texas!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Let him go!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: First put down the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Do what he says.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He’ll kill us both!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I don’t wanna kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Do it, Star. Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: There was only one bullet in that gun.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I don’t like it when people point guns at
me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It wasn’t loaded.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You took on a guy like me with one bullet
and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Can I have my gun back?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: In the city.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: The city? Oh man. That place is red hot.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Seemed kinda dead to me.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No– radiation.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That wasn’t a helicopter…</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: It’s an H-K– hunter-killer. Where the hell have
you been?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Rads musta fried his brains. Let’s go,
Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Marcus. Marcus Wright.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Kyle Reese. She doesn’t remember her name– –so
I call her Star.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Why? We don’t need him.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I like him. He’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Nope. Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yup. Two thousand eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fifteen years… I’ve lost 15 years. So who
did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese–?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The nukes. There was a war, right? Who
started it?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Something fall on your head? The machines did
it, the computers– they got smart.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Judgment Day… I was just a baby.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s the last thing you remember?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dying.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Eyeball. Only one.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That flying grapefruit, what was it?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Aerostat– one of Skynet’s eyes. They patrol
places like this, looking for survivors.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Any red ones?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Yuk!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Jalape�o sauce.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: You can read.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: So can I. Well, sort of… a little.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No thanks. Not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Never heard anyone say that before.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I look the same.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You ever watch television?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look
forward to in the joint.</p>
<p>****: What’s a joint?</p>
<p>****: Prison. Spent half my life there.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I remember TV a little. Cartoons. It was
great.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She your sister?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dunno. Been together since we was little.
Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell… she and
me are the only ones still around.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So this is it? Your life?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We’re gonna find the Resistance, fight for
John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you’re pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You’re strong, you can read… you didn’t kill
us. Good enough for me…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Skynet runs the machines…? So who’s this
John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He’s… I don’t know. The best. Everybody talks
about him. He’s the one who’s gonna save us.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Who’s Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re asking the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: So why were you in prison?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I killed a cop.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Were cops like terminators?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well… Nah, some of `em were all right.</p>
<p>****: My little brother Max, pretty wild kid, not much older than
you– he stole a car, just joy-riding, y’know, showing off.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MARCUS</p>
<p>****: Max must be dead too, now… like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You gonna be here when I wake up?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Good. Stay away from the windows.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Just me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The bible. My grandma always tried to get me
into it, but– it always put me to sleep.</p>
<p>****: Still does.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Would you read something to me?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: “…of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of
Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh–”</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: There’s a book inside with pictures.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: “Guaranteed lowest prices… open seven
days…”</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s a flower. A rose.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: So… all those numbers… you could call them and
get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you
food…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Guess people had it pretty good.</p>
<p>****: What else we got… movers, mufflers, music–</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Music?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You know, pianos, guitars…</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: I don’t remember music.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Come on. You must… “I can’t get no…
satisfaction…” “We are family… I got all my sisters with me…” No, huh.
How about… “Twinkle twinkle little star…”</p>
<p><strong>marcus &amp; star</strong>: “How I wonder what you are… up
above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky…”</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Somebody used to sing that to me.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: If we get it to move, will you teach me to
make it go?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s called driving. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Wow. What were these like?</p>
<p>****: Not too many around in my time.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Aerostat’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Music…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Oh no! It’s gonna call a Harvester, we’re
dead–</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Wow. You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No! You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: –proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to
diesel fuel. A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic
garbage bag, and will detonate on impact…</p>
<p>****: That’s him!</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: This recording has described booby-
traps and explosive devices. It will repeat every two hours on different
frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Do not give in to despair. As bleak as
things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We oughta find a place to hole up for the
day…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Damn it. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You smell that?</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Food!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Spit it out!</p>
<p>****: It’s good!</p>
<p><strong>cow</strong>: Not much meat on `em.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: This one’s fi-i-ine–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>pig</strong>: We didn’t kill
<code>em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let</code>em
rot–</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Go `head, take as much as you want, we’re on
the same side here–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Yo! Up here!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Name’s Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You can put me down now, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m heading that way.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: The hot zone? No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’ve got to get to my friends–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: What friends?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Couple of kids. They were in that flying
dumpster–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: The Skynet transport? It was carrying people?
Christ, we almost shot it down. There’ve been rumors about a
concentration camp, but…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hydrobots?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: They can’t see, but they have killer sonar.
They’ll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get
past them, you’d be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the
terminators don’t get you, the fallout will– heavy rads all the way to
the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re with the Resistance.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be
the Air National Guard.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I don’t know… this has gotta be some kind
of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right
before they die…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: That snap you out of it?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: So let me get this straight, Marcus. There
you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: BLAIR</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Whatever they pumped into your veins just
knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for– there was a lotta
cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What the hell for?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Drug tests, medical experiments, organ
harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends– why let a
body like yours go to waste?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’ve never seen trees like these.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: We’re in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed
squirrel here once–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Freaky.</p>
<p>****: Tasted like chicken.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: I didn’t hear anything–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: They’re surrounding us.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: They’re smart. And they don’t scare easy.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dog eat dog world.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Staf? What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: It’s a resistance term. Sit tight and
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m not gay. In prison, I thought about
puss– women all the time. But now… it’s not working. Who knows, all
those years on ice…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Maybe it’s just gonna take some time. Before
you’re completely thawed out.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I dunno. They just… sorta reminded me of
her.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There’s a woman, the last woman I saw
before… when I was under, the dead time– she kept coming to me. I think
she must’ve saved me.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: I can’t compete with that.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We’ve landed.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: What’s going to happen to us?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We’re in somebody’s garden.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Christ… there’s supposed to be barbed wire
along the edge.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t move.</p>
<p>****: Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody hear me?! We’re in the middle
of the mine field.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Somebody feed those things!</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Start up the generator, Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We got company!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Blair? Good to see you. What’s the
password?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Eat shit and die, Barnes!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Close enough. Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Could you get us outta here please?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine
field.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You didn’t maintain the perimeter! Where are
your sentries?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s too early for that military crap.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You goddamn idiot!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: He was takin’ bigger steps!</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Son of a bitch is heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be
in a hundred pieces…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Does he have a prosthetic limb?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: This is not skin… oh Jesus– oh God–</p>
<p><strong>memory montage</strong>: QUICK SHOTS– altered,
impressionistic, as before. SFX of STATIC, high-pitched, complex DIGITAL
NOISE.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Why isn’t he conscious? Something’s wrong,
he should be coming out of it by now…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thermoplastic skin, some larger hydraulics,
but mostly titanium microgears… This looks like some sort of aeration
and hydration system, function unclear at this point. Valves and what
looks like an access panel below the ribcage…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Whatever he is– he’s on our side–</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: How can he be?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: He saved my life!</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Winning your trust would aid his
infiltration.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Regional doesn’t know what to do. They’re
gonna patch us through to Command Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How could you bring this monster here?! This
is our home! Our children–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: What do you want from me– I didn’t know!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It’s awake!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Get me the hell down from here!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Shut up! I told you to shut up!</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Leave him alone! Marcus, I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It keeps talkin’ at me. God this thing gives
me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Why are you doing this? What is this
place?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: We’re trying to–</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t say anything! It’s probably uplinked to
Skynet.</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Then it’s already too late. This used to
be an ICBM silo, we’re just trying to stay alive here. Your turn–
where’d you come from?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Corpus Christi. It’s in Texas. Or it
was.</p>
<p>****: It sounds completely human… it really could pass.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Didn’t John Connor say they’d start building
things like this?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Not yet– not for years. So, you’re
programmed with false memories, a human history–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: You can skip the act, we know what you
are.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Why are you even speaking to it?!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: She’s right, let’s just waste the damn
thing–</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’ll kill us all if we give it a</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m a man!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MARCUS</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Regional got through to CLA– they want us to
rig a video feed. He wants to see him.</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Who does?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: John Connor.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So this guy is what, like king of the world,
or what’s left of it?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: John Connor founded the Resistance. When
the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was– Connor taught us how
to fight back. He saved humanity.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, well, humanity’s never done all that
much for me. Why can’t I see him?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Nobody sees him. Skynet can’t be allowed
to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret.</p>
<p><strong>connor’s voice</strong>: –hello– standing by–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Sir, we can hear you, sir, working on a
visual, sir…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Not what I expected…</p>
<p><strong>connor’s voice</strong>: It does seem lifelike– is the face
able to mimic emotions–?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do
you want from me?</p>
<p>****: I– I need to know what you are.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So do I! I don’t know what I am, what I’m
doing here, I don’t know shit– maybe I never did, but– I’m sick of it!
Just blow my head off or let me go.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This isn’t right. I can’t be having a
conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn’t that sophisticated yet.
Unless… were you sent here from the future?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Skynet’s developing a time displacement
field, we’ve decrypted recent data transmissions.</p>
<p>****: I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back
decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re out of your mind, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>connor’s voice</strong>: Jesus… I’ve seen enough. Stand by
for further instructions.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s not a cyborg– no blood, no human tissue
over the endoskeleton.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Besides, the first T-800s won’t be
manufactured until `26.</p>
<p><strong>advisor #1</strong>: Maybe he’s a one-off, an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>advisor #2</strong>: Let’s hope. If there are more out there
like him, we’re in serious trouble. Christ, a terminator with
attitude…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Where did they find him?</p>
<p><strong>advisor #1</strong>: East-central Texas, near an area of
heavy Skynet concentration. The outpost where they’re holding him is
reasonably secure, but it’s not much more than a commune.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I want him extracted.</p>
<p><strong>advisor #1</strong>: Done. What then?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Get him to our best people for disassembly,
find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull,
crack his CPU at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Because people trust you… you give them
faith–</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I
know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know
I’m going to send my own father back through time to save my mother–
even though I haven’t met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I’m
going to die…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So how could I not know about this?!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Feels like I been here before… what are you
gonna do to me?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper–
seems you’re some kind of VIP.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We’re stopping.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Whatever happens, we stick together.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hello? Anyone there?</p>
<p>****: I’m thirsty.</p>
<p>****: Want some motor oil?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I need water.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Bullshit. Machines don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Please, I’m–</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Shut up, robot!</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: How’s it going, Barnes? Thought you might
like a late-night snack.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Where in hell’d you get these?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: We got a stash back at the base.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Kinda stale.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You need something to wash it down.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’m on duty, you know.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You know I always liked you, Barnes. I just
didn’t want to join the harem.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What can I say? It’s our duty to repopulate
the planet.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Noble of you to make the sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: I prefer a little privacy.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You’re so twentieth century…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Men. You’re all talk.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: I don’t believe you’re a terminator.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So what am I…?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Whatever you are– I owe you one. Once you’re
free, I’ll lie down next to Barnes– they’ll assume you escaped while we
were passed out–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You think they’ll buy that?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take
you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you’re alive– and
you’ve got a right to live.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: They’re already here for you–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m heading across the river.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: No human being can survive there–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m not human, remember?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: You’re gonna try and save those kids.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s the only thing I can think of that
makes any sense…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Marcus, for all you know, they’re dead
already–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: For all I know, they’re the reason I’m back
from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Damn it, we’re too late–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where’s that go?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Should lead out, but there’s no way past the
fan–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Here. My ELT– emergency locator transmitter.
If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the
Resistance.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I need to talk to the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Lieutenant Williams. I’m sorry about the way
you’ve been treated, but we’re forced to take every precaution. I’m John
Connor.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: At ease. Please, sit.</p>
<p>****: Why in God’s name would you help a terminator escape?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Sir– he isn’t a terminator. He’s human.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We know he’s crossed into Skynet territory,
why would he do that if he isn’t–</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: He’s trying to find his friends.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What friends?</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet
transport, probably to some kind of prison camp– he said their names
were Star and Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Mm… Kyle something. With an `R.’</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Reese.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: That’s it. How did you…?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What is it, John?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I always knew I’d have to find him someday.
I just didn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What? Find who?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: My father.</p>
<p><strong>kyle and star</strong>: Twinkle, twinkle, little star…</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Oh no, oh no…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Shh, keep singing.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Up above the world so high, like a diamond in
the sky…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Stop it stop it STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You look like you’ve been hit by a
truck–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Among other things. Look, I’m trying to find
some friends– a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some
buildings–</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: The facility, sure. Hop in, I’ll take you
there.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I can’t connect with you at all… your
interface must’ve been damaged. Don’t worry, soon they’ll have you as
good as new.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I didn’t think there was– anything like this
left… anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yes. We’re very lucky. Want some?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This isn’t food.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Well, of course not. Seems you got a little
memory loss going on.</p>
<p>****: Our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Terminators!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: We don’t call them that here.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: A hybrid. The same as you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: A hybrid– human and machine?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Of course. That’s what this community is
for– people like us.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Jesus… why?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You should be grateful to have been
chosen.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What about the ones who weren’t?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You mean like Janet and the kids.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Your family. You lost them?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: `Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes
negative emotions– rage, grief, despair– and stimulates positive
endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable
otherwise, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Tell me everything. How did you people get
here?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an
engineer on Project Angel–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Angel– what is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic
Life-forms… A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it’s not like I need to
breathe.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: English!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: The goal was a superior support system for
the human brain– to go anywhere, do anything– explore deep space, the
bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: 32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no,
insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn’t have even
been brought here…</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Marcus!</p>
<p>****: It’s a graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: There was no choice– the old civilization
had to be eliminated. To make way for a new world… a world without death
or suffering.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Sir, I’m sorry to disturb you, but you said
you wanted to know immediately–</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: We found our terminator.</p>
<p><strong>air force officer</strong>: The signal’s coming from near
what used to be Galveston, right on the coast.</p>
<p><strong>naval officer</strong>: There can’t be any prisoners there.
The whole area’s a nuclear wasteland– only machines can survive the
radiation levels for any length of time.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Mobilize a combined air and naval assault,
all available resources. We’re sending in a rescue team ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: All to find one teenage boy…? John, you really
think this can work?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m standing here, I exist– so it must have
worked. We will find him.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Calm down, Marcus. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Like fuck it is. I’m sick of being your
guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Repairing you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You all work for Skynet!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Please. Skynet works for us. It’s only a
program– a tool, a means to an end.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Into– this? A brain in a box?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Skynet had access to the entire defense web–
including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to
salvation.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Destroying the human race in order to save
it.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: When the resistance attacked our
installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you
with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No, stop… I don’t want it! You’re dead
inside, all of you!</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: We’re immortal. No sane person would choose
to live in pain, forever. Soon you’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: How are you feeling, Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m not sure I know how to describe it.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: It’s called happiness. You’ve been angry all
your life. You don’t know what it’s like to feel… a part of
something.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Pure ecstasy… we can share in it
together.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: When I was a kid my grandmother would go on
about heaven… it always sounded so boring.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Were you bored just now?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals… working
with Skynet, we’re making amazing breakthroughs, well beyond anything
possible before Judgment Day.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: We’ve already freed ourselves from
biological limits… soon we’ll transcend the laws of physics.</p>
<p><strong>clock</strong>: the date, 10.16.18, 00:25, SECONDS FLASHING
PAST.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: A time machine… Connor was right.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: The Resistance leader? You know him?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …I’ve just heard him speak.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: He’s a dangerous man. Delusional. He thinks
he’s a savior, but all he’s really fighting for is… death.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: In the world outside– the survivors think
Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don’t you tell them about
all this?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Not everyone can become like us, Marcus. We
just don’t have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand
hybrids.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Then why… Some people I knew were picked up,
taken here…</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: A boy and a girl– in the last day or
two?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yes… what is this place?</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Part of the neural net– human minds linked
directly with artificial intelligence. The processing power of the human
brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That’s them.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Good news. He’ll soon be part of the
network– you’ll be able to connect with him.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Of course. I… I understand.</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: I don’t know– I have to go. Will you be all
right? Of course you will.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I need to go back!</p>
<p><strong>physicist</strong>: The wormholing fluctuates, right now it’s
oscillating between three and six hours–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>physicist</strong>: Just breach the sphere. But you could
materialize anywhere in a mile radius–</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: 32581 looks good… 32582… hm, borderline.
May not be emotionally compatible. Pass.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Let them go.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: What? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I said, let them go!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You can’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Now you’re pissing me off.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Marcus!</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: I knew you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We’ve gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Stay down!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Watch me!</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: That looked like–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I know. Long story.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The trees!</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you drive?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Come on I was doing good!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: Don’t come any closer!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There are more prisoners, a complex about a
mile in–</p>
<p><strong>haz-mat man</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Kyle Reese.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: John Connor. I’m glad you made it.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, well. Get in line.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Does this hurt?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I don’t feel a thing. Help somebody
else.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Your dad– he seems like a nice kid.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The last boatload is right behind me.
Skynet’s pouring in reinforcements, we can’t hold this place. And the
people in the houses, they won’t leave–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: They’re not people anymore…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her
coat–</p>
<p><strong>serena</strong>: Why, Marcus? You were immortal…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No one lives forever.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This… this can’t happen…</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Marcus… I need to head back to my unit.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I have no idea. I should be dead…</p>
<p><strong>star</strong>: But you’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So to speak.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: We’ve been ordered not to talk about it– the
hybrids, everything about that place is top secret…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
machine.</p>
<p>****: What did it feel like? To be… one of them?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Better than anything. Everything made sense.
For the first time in my life, I felt… right. It was heaven.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: How could you give that up?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I never really believed in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>blair</strong>: Here. You need these more than I do.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Her name was Sarah… she was… amazing…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t remember my mother.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Kyle, could you give us a minute?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re asking me to become… Him?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You must.</p>
<p>****: We can’t keep him alive much longer. Very few people know what
John actually looks like. Only the technicians and our closest advisors
need ever know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Who else? Only you know the enemy from the
inside. You liberated a Skynet camp… you’re a hero.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I never knew how I was supposed to win this
war. But I finally understand: the idea of John Connor is more important
than the person. I can die. He cannot.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Please. We need you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death…</p>
