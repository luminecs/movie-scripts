<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Fall back into the woods! Out of
your saddles before you’re shot out of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Gatling! They’ve got a Gatling!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years
ago!</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Cole! Bob! You boys okay?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hell, take more than a cannon to kill the
Younger brothers, sir!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I think the cannon’s doing a pretty good job,
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Some Indian tracker you turned out to be,
Tom.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You pay me to find you Bluecoats.
There they are.</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: They’re using the Gatling and the
cannon to cover their advance. We’re pinned unless we take them out!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Those gunners are too far away…</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Get me the James boy.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You want Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Not Jesse, the one who can
shoot.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: FRANK!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Watch Web.</p>
<p><strong>web</strong>: I don’t need watchin’!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Web, I bring you back dead and your sister’ll
kill me. Now shut up and lie there. Careful, Frank. And make sure Bob
and Cole are okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cannon or Gatling?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Both would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Soon as I hit one, the other’ll know and beat
us up.</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Cannon.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hell no…</p>
<p><strong>web</strong>: Aw, Jesse. I never even got to be with a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: They’re getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: ’Bout time you got here, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every time I put my head up to hit that
Gatling, they try to shoot it off.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So we got a plan?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to
be working mighty fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can hit those boys from here. We just need
a distraction.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A distraction? Well, why the hell didn’t you
just say so?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s smiling.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Never a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This ought to be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Come on, ya Yankee bastards!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: WAAAHHHHOOOO!! We’re coming Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>captain malcolm</strong>: Charge!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, you do not!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You ain’t even been with a girl, have
you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Git.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Distracting enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pff. They hardly even noticed you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So you’re saying I could have done more to
attract their attention.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You could have worn one of those big, floppy
woman’s Easter Sunday hats.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That would have made an impression.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I figure.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: See, that’s your problem, Frank. By the time
you finish figuring out stuff, I’m already finished doing it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, Jesse, your problem is you’re always
doing stuff before I’m finished figuring it out.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Wait’ll we get back to Missouri, start telling
those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by
himself!</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You ride like a Comanche.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You can ride like that?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I said like a Comanche, not this
Comanche.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ride with me, cousin?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I could use the walk.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Suit yourself. We’ll have some horses waiting
for you at the road. Let’s ride, Rangers!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now, I would just sound stupid saying something
like that…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Web’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I reckoned.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hell of a war.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sure it seemed like a good idea at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where you boys going?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There’s Yankees back there. Lot’s of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: War’s over, son. General Lee surrendered
yesterday at Appomattox.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN
YANKEES!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get
there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our
homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who
tries to get me to leave my farm again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Best damn plan I heard all war.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello, Liberty Missoura!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: All this time in the saddle… We get to the
farm, I’m going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Never thought that pissant town would look so
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Anywhere nobody’s shooting at me is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Home, boys. Back to our farms.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after
year.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Corn gonna shoot at me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Then I love it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Tom, why don’t you stop at our spread before
you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for
you, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Hmm. Go back to the reservation and
get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I’m thinking…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: We got problems.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What the –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Must be a garrison in town. We’re in occupied
territory, boys.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hands off your hip, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re not scared, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me
that.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It gets worse.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus mercy, that’s Charlie Higgins, Dave
Laller …</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: … Will Perry …</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They rode with Quantrill’s Rangers.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Looks like Web Mimms wasn’t the only casualty
this town’s got.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We better go to Doc’s, see what’s going on
here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m cutting them down.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: In case we have to kill these sonofabitches,
I don’t want them to see us coming.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure
Little Jim and the girls are okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma
we’re all right. We’ll go to Doc Mimms.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I think I may just go on to the
reservation.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tom, I’m this close to coming with you…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Scuse me, we’re here for the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Jesse! Frank!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You were little Jesse James when you left.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: But you got big!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I mean, you aged –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I mean, I mean, in a good way you got big and
older.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Frank, don’t you have something to say?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Zee, we got to talk to you and your
father.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Frank, Jesse. Where’s Web?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: – rode right into them, screaming like a
banshee.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: My little Web did that?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our
heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whyyyy… he took down the Gatling gun and the
cannon all by himself.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty
boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God’s honest
truth.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Web died fighting?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Died a hero.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: But still died.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: If there’s anything we can do for you,
Dr. Mimms. We want to help.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Start thinking about yourselves. You, the
Youngers, Clell Miller, all of you. Don’t end up like Charlie. They
found out Charlie rode with Quantrill’s Raiders. They arrested him,
tried him by military tribunal and hanged him this morning.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought there was general amnesty.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: For soldiers, yes. But if you rode in one
of the partisan bands, they’ll hang you for treason. And you boys are in
more danger, because you’ve got a farm.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Daddy, don’t start with this again.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Zerelda, it’s no coincidence. The
railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then
they start hanging men who own farms for treason?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re saying the railroad’s got the Army
doing it’s dirty work?</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Rich men in Washington, don’t matter if
they wear a tie or a uniform, they’re all the same.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: All we thought about was coming home. I swore
I’d kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go
to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Think about this. If we just come up with a
story and stick to it, we should be all right.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What kind of story are they going to
believe?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Hmm. You were in the Confederate Army with
General Hood’s Texas Army until… say Sharpsburg, then you were
reassigned to General Jeb Stuart’s cavalry until you surrendered in
Tennessee.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That just might work.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Now go on to see your Ma. She’ll be glad
to see her sons alive. And for her sake, stay that way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ll be back on Saturday with Cole and Bob,
give you a hand with the repairs.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Thank you. For everything. Especially that
story you told my father.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I’m going to go cry now, so I don’t have time
for your lies. But I’ll see you Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That Zerelda turned into a hell of a woman,
eh –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Big and older”?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You can shut up now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You are a charmer.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I swear I’ll shoot you in your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Next time try “fat and haggard.”</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: My boys! My boys!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: My boys are alive!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not if you don’t ease up a bit, Ma…</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Did you kill Yankees?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A fair number, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Say your prayers?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every night, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Good. Now get inside and wash up for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well look at Jimmy Younger. You’re all grown
up.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mmmph-hmpph.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Your Ma wouldn’t let us leave until we ate
something.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That was two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: I don’t see clean plates.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ma, I’m glad to see you being nice to our
Injun friend.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: He’s a good Christian and he killed Yankees.
Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s still talking to Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What worries me is that Jesus is talking
back.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You ever notice Zerelda’s eyes?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She got two of them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think one of ’em’s glass.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Which one, right or left?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The brown one.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You talk big for a man who screwed another
man back in Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty’s…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Sadie was not a man!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: She had a moustache.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She was European!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: All right, calm down. I’ll agree Sadie was a
woman –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: – if you stop saying things about my Zee.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Your Zee? Hmm. “From women’s eyes this
doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They
are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish
all the world.”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I have no idea what you just said, but it
sounded real nice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shakespeare. He’s European.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You want to write that down for me so I can
say it to Zee?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Thanks for the help.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: After all you did on our farm? You miss it,
don’t you Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: The war? What, are you crazy? There are
things I miss about it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It was exciting.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should
we miss that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Because we were good at it? Hell, we were
great at it. Jesse, don’t tell anyone I said this, because everybody
knows I’m the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying
sonofabitch with those guns.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Howdy, folks. How are you this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: “Howdy”?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Easterners.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: We’re just fine, thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I am Rollin H. Parker, personal emissary of
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, president of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.
These two gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives, working for Mr. Thaddeus
Rains, president of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, and this
gentleman here is the famous Alan Pinkerton, founder of the Secret
Service and now working under contract to Mr. Thaddeus Rains.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Would that be Thaddeus Rains, president of
the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: As you have no doubt heard from your
neighbors, our railroad is moving west.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That makes sense, as east would put you
underwater.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: … moving west, opening the frontier for
folks such as yourself. Your acreage here is on the proposed right of
way.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m here for your signature on this land
sales contract. I’m authorized to pay you two dollars an acre.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Two dollars?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s right. That’s the price authorized by
the railroad’s board, and approved by the Department of the Interior of
the Government of the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: This land ain’t for sale.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Ma’am, I can understand how you might
feel that way – you’ve made a lovely home here. But it’s really not up
to me or you. Are you familiar with the legal concept of the Right of
Eminent Domain?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, I am. What about it?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Well, this land is about to be
condemned.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m doing you folks a favor –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Said the skinner to the mule.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: – with a price of two dollars an acre for
this one time only offer. After today the price goes down. So if I were
you, I’d just sign the contract, and I’ll be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell
Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where the sun don’t shine.
Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>jesse/cole</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: I don’t think you understand. You don’t
have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Ma’am. You have to look in your heart and do
what you know is right here.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Let me ask the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: The Lord says we can bury ’em out back in the
orchard, nobody’ll ever find them.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Somebody’s in a vengeful smiting mood
today.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why don’t we just let them go for today, Ma.
We’ll bury them out back next time.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Oh all right.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You people are making a serious mistake!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Nicely played.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Where the hell did you get those guns?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I went up to the courthouse and looked at the
right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn’t even need
our land, they’re just taking the land on both sides for as far as they
can.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Damn. All that reading paid off.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Floor recognizes Clell Miller.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: They’re saying we don’t sell, we might end up
with nothing!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s only if we don’t stick together.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Loni Packwood.</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: I say this is the last straw. I came back from
the war, I found my house burned down. My cows was dead. Now my wife’s
run off with my cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch. Took my dog–</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Ah, Loni, about the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: I forget. Took my dog…</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I signed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Harlan, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I’m tired of fighting. I’m just gonna take
my family and move west.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: Maybe we should hire a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>farmer 2</strong>: That’s a good idea!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It would be, if the courts were on the up and
up.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They got Cole.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: He came to our house, Daddy. I figured you’d
all want to hear this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They came up, made the same offer they made you
folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase ’em off, one of those
detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his
temper.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He just lost his temper a little.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: How many of them did he kill?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They said because the detectives were working
for the Department of the Interior –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The Army can hang him.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You folks are going to do nothing. You’re all
going to go home right now. So you’re going to be able to swear on a
Bible that you don’t know anything about what’s going to happen
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Boys…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Go home, Doc. They ain’t gonna hang no more
Liberty boys.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I couldn’t lose him.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Jim Younger, I told you–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s my fault they’re gonna hang Cole. I want
in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jim, it was just a matter of time before they
tried to hang somebody else to scare off the other farmers.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And you’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m the same age you were when you went off to
war.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And the same age Web was. No.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You’re wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Zee, go home.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Who else was there when they hanged the
others?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You need to know how they do it. Which way they
walk up. What order they do things in. And if you mess up rescuing Cole
because you won’t listen to a woman, then God damn you all.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: All right. Seven of us against a Union
regiment and Pinkerton detectives in broad daylight in the middle of
Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s smiling.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Is that bad?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand.
And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like
a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: It’s not my job to relax. I’ve put men
facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting.
I’ve got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Brilliant…</p>
<p><strong>the hangman reaches for the lever again, but just as
he</strong>: DOES -</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Sir, are you all right? Somebody get a
doctor!</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: He’s going to be fine, right Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: The bullet came out clean, but he lost a
whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Good evening, sir, we’re looking for a
fugitive.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: A fugitive? Who?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We don’t know, but he was very badly
wounded. We’re checking all the houses in the area.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Sir! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Oh. Sorry ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I should hope so.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Jesse, are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Jesse, is that your hand?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Nuh-huh …</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: They’re gone. What are you –</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I fooled them into thinking I was alone.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We
should know in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I think he’s already feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to
have you join us in the field.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: And it is my pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Really!</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my
board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in
the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple
farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the
GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I can completely understand your distress,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Parker, tell me what’s going on so I can
return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not
necessarily in that order.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have
the Army hang one of the local farmers.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local
thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired
resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton
was seriously injured during the incident.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Leaving you in charge of operations until he
recovers.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Just perfect.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: A further impediment is that the Army
garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer
have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: You see the Army leaving and you see the loss
of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power,
we may move with impunity.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I see. I’ll get together four patrols of our
detectives for action tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I’ll teach these podunks what happens when
they challenge the righteousness of progress.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You shouldn’t be up.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ve been on my back two weeks. I’m sick of
it.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You’re sick of my company?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No! I mean, of course not. No.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Teasing you is completely unfair.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I shouldn’t tease a hero.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Everybody in the county knows it was you who
rescued Cole. We’re all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm’s
been sold to the railroad since. You’re everybody’s hero.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I wasn’t the only one risking my neck that
day.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: So you’re saying I should leave you alone and
go spend time with Jimmy Younger?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Unfair. You are completely unfair.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You ready to stop loafing around with this
young lady and get back to farming?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has
you home so she can fuss over you herself, she’s gonna make me
miserable.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What do you say, sir?</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Go on. You’re pretty much all healed
up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re looking a bit more spry now that
somebody –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Shut up. Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,
this evening, I could come by?</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: You know you’re welcome any time!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by,
and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But
out.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: It’s fine by me, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t worry, sir, I’ll make sure they’re
always properly chaperoned.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: Why, that hadn’t even occurred to me,
Frank. I am deeply in your debt.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Army’s leaving town, so Cole can stop hiding
up in the woods and come back to his farm. Everybody’s getting together
at the Younger place for a to-do.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Here’s Liberty’s favorite son! I’ll never
forget what you did, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Zee, I’m pleased you came.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Why thank you, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m especially pleased you came with Jesse.
Seeing as right now there’s a gaggle of girls hoping to dance with Jesse
who are just going to have to settle for the many charms of Bob
Younger.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You have no shame.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not yet. But I’m hoping.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I used to come to this tree when I was a kid
and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You didn’t want to farm?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I was thinking more along the lines of being
a river pirate.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: A river pirate.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow
out of that, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a
bachelor.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You planning on being a bachelor your whole
life, Jesse James?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Not if I find the right girl.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: And what’s this right girl like?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think
she’s two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Where will you find such a girl?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Honestly, you’d do if only you had the buck
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ahem. “From this doctrine…” No, ah… “From
women’s eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like … shiny…
sparkling rocks…”</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Sparkling rocks?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Little ones.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Is this one of Frank’s Shakespeare poems you’re
trying to quote?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Were you planning on kissing me when you
finished quoting?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ve been planning on kissin’ you for a very
long time.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get buckets!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pinkertons. It’s the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ma.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ma! Ma!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ma! Please!</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Boys?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus mercy –</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Riders –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc
Mimms.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Take care of each other, boys. You say your
prayers.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Doc Mimms will –</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Shush.</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong>: Well look at that. The Good Lord’s a bit shorter
than I reckoned.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: … We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent
life someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Didn’t think you would. I’m going to go make
the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Make a thousand of ’em. Still won’t be enough
by the time I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Our place, Clell Miller’s, Sammy Johnston, the
Creeders. Will Hite.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas
boys.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I say we ride into town and kill us some
Pinkertons and railroad men.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: This isn’t a feud, this is war. They’ve got
more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace ’em in a
day.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: So what do we do, General Lee?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just like in the war. Harass their supply
lines. We kill the railroad’s men, they won’t care.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But if we take their money and supplies…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s a great plan, Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll get us a few more men, and Comanche Tom’ll
ride with us.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where do we hit first, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ll pick the first job! I mean… I know a girl
down at the bank. See if she can’t get a list of towns where the
railroad keeps its money.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Perfect, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Let’s ride.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I am so sorry, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Frank and me have to go away for a while.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You and I, we’ve started… something, you know?
I don’t know what’ll happen if you do this.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Let the law –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Laws don’t touch men like Thaddeus Rains.
Only justice does.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Whose justice? Yours or God’s? When will you
stop?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: When my name makes them cry in their sleep.
When I’ve brought them to ashes.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but I have
bad news. The railroad payroll has been stolen.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What are you talking about? The railroad’s
money is right over there in that safe.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That safe?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hold on there, sir. Bank’s closed today.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Wha?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bank holiday! Bank’s closed!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ow! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This is outrageous. Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: The James Gang.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The James-Younger Gang.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t let it happen again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sir, it’s a bank holiday –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ow ow!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ma’am, kindly cover that child’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t want her to see me shoot this man.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I know it ain’t no durned bank holiday!</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You’re right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Then why can’t I go in there?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: On account of we’re robbing it.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh. Why didn’t you just say so?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Fine. I’ll just wait here.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I’d appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: What the –</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet
outside the bank.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: When have you ever known Old Man Tucker
not to be yelling at everybody?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’d it go in there?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fine. How’d it go out here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re gonna have to talk…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sir, you can do this the smart way, or the
stupid way. Only one way ends with you still breathin’.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just ’cause we’re robbing a bank, no reason
not to be civil about it.</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: Where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: I had you covered. From back there.</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I got seven thousand.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I got three.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ten thousand dollars! That’s almost a thousand
apiece!</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: My luck is changing at last!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: These are deeds and mortgages of farms the
bank was holding for the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Better pass them over here before something
happens to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: All right, settle down. All this money ain’t
ours.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank’s. That’s why
we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to
him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: We oughta take some of this, give it to our
neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: None of them risked their necks for this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now, let’s think about this. We create some
good will with the folks hereabouts, make it easier to dodge the
law.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: See, Frank’s being smart about this.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Just because he reads all those books and
knows all those big words doesn’t make him smart.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uhh, yeah it does.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You stay out of this, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think Jesse’s got a good idea –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You stay out of this too, Jim. Who put you in
charge of this gang, anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine leading us during
the War.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And I planned getting you off the hangman’s
deck –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And that’s why you both lead the gang. Two of
you went into that bank together, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two heads are better than one. All Jesse was
doing was making a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So we’re waiting to hear what you think of
the suggestion. As the other leader of the gang.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I reckon it’s the smart thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hey! We decide something, that’s it! We’re in
this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse’s will help give
us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a
shotgun sneakin’ up on us in our sleep. We’ve got to think –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Strategically.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: – Exactly. Because this is a war.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: This ain’t no war.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: Nobody paid me no thousand dollars to fight
in the War!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s not a bank.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s better. It’s a construction depot.
They’ll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take.
That way we can take on a bigger job.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And it’s guarded by Pinkerton detectives.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton
detectives.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’re famous!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll be damned!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on
Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men.”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Twenty?!</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: What are the odds, another gang robbing the
same place right after we did.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, Loni, that’s exactly what happened.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “The outlaws calling themselves the
James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and
three other townsfolk.”</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty
thousand dollars.”</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: We only got ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: This happens all the time when you let
the white man count the money.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “The U.S. District Marshal at St. Louis
called this the first daylight bank robbery in American history.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We made history. That’s something to be proud
of.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The rest of this is all lies.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That just means the next time, we’ll have to
set the record straight ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton
Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and
blew the tracks for half a mile.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: How much did they get from the safe?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and
currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track –</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I’ll kill them for blowing up my railway!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: To be precise, they didn’t blow up the
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: THEN WHO DID?!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: … I mean, our men. Our own workers planted
the dynamite. They were under duress.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Where the hell is Pinkerton?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the
payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at
least.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Not to mention my men who lost their
lives.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Your men knew the risks.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: What is going on here, man?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: My professional opinion is that you have
managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: They had to be dealt with!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: By burning down their homes?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: You wouldn’t have done that?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Oh no, I would have done that. But I
would have made sure I killed them, too.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I want them arrested and hanged!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Would a jury around here convict their
own? I think not. We’re beginning an interesting game here,
Mr. Rains.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: This is no game.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: I’m afraid our adversaries don’t
agree.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: “A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was
robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and
daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton
detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the
West.”</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: It is a nice piece of writing.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: “The gang made off with thirty-five thousand
dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that
for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing
the railroad is coming to steal their land!” Who wrote this!? I’ll see
him hanged every Tuesday for a month!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Oh, that’s the best part.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: “The foregoing article was sent to the
newspaper. It was reputedly written by the outlaw – Jesse James
himself!”</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: “…written by the outlaw Jesse James
himself.”</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: He thinks this is some kind of game!</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: I’m upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole
know what they’re doing. I’m sure they won’t press their luck.</p>
<p><strong>doc mimms</strong>: I know. But the Lord protects madmen and
prophets, and Jesse’s…one of them. I’m just not sure which.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: “Better… slow… down… dynamite… ahead… too
late… you’re dead!”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That was a fine piece of driving, yes
sir.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Could you change this please?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Sir, this bill is counterfeit!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I don’t think it’s counterfeit. Do you mind
if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s the scientific method. It’s all the
rage.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Senator, can’t you do anything?</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: The people see the James-Younger Gang as
heroes against the Eastern businessmen. This is not an area where men in
suits are much loved.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Pinkerton, why can’t you get these
outlaws?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: It’s early in the game yet, Mr. Rains.
Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out
each other’s patterns.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I’m losing millions of dollars and months of
time while you play chess with these farmers!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Hardly farmers. I’ve done some checking.
All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have
four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are
disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to
design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: So you can’t tell me anything?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: It’s going to be a long winter.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I never thought that posse was gonna give
up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They were admirably persistent.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Jesse, we got to have a word.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sure, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: All the posters and newspapers are calling
this bunch the “James-Younger Gang.”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Why aren’t we the “Younger-James Gang”? I
mean, there’s three Younger brothers and only two James brothers
here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I kinda like the sound of the James-Younger
Gang.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Whose side you on?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang
could be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Say we bust into a bank. We yell “We’re the
Younger-James Gang!” People are gonna be thinking, “The younger James
Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older
James gang?” So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising
their arms.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Can’t argue with that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I think you boys are missing the point
here…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How about “James-Younger” for the bank jobs and
“Younger-James” for the train robberies?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: See, that’s even more confusing, people’ll
think there’s two gangs…</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You ’um big lawman?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yeah, Injun. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Great Chief of St. Louis send me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The District Marshall</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Of St. Louis?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in
Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great
River, near Eagle Rock.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: East? East above the river heading for the
Eagle Pass?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Ho-yah!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I want every man in town! We can cut off
Jesse James before he crosses out of my territory! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Go ahead to the saloon. But don’t get too
drunk!</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Me get heap firewater –</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: – you cretins.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nice performance, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: I feel dirty.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Pinkerton. It’s been eight months. I see
robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of
nooses.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: All of the James Gang’s encounters have
been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for
this group’s cunning.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What about your detectives? They haven’t
–</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: First of all: you, shut up. Now, you’ve
given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James
Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there’s
just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in.
This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles
between jobs.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: And there are some towns in Missouri
where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How can that be?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: They donate money to farmers, to
churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much
money they were able to build a school.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: With my money!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We should go burn that school to the ground,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Yes, that’s the way to win the locals
back to our side.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I demand action.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: No, you demand results. They are not the
same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see
fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another
run at it?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Can’t you tell me anything?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: It’s going to be a long spring.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: See, that’s a shame. If people would just
hand over the money and not shoot at us –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: Lucky Rabbit’s foot. Took it off that dead
fella over there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t think that one’s working, Loni.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay, folks, I think we know how this is
going to go…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: One false move and I’ll blow your heads
off!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Beg pardon?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I
get!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: ’Scuse us.</p>
<p><strong>head teller</strong>: Think nothing of it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We got a problem here, brother?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Frankly, yes. I’m feeling a little left
out.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: This is about the “Wanted!” Posters, isn’t
it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes. I am obviously not standing out in
people’s minds at the robberies.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This is your fault for hogging all the
publicity.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an
important part of the gang.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Gents, we are in the middle of something
here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Bob’s upset.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The posters?</p>
<p><strong>jesse/cole</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Don’t say “yeah” in that voice. This is
important.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get
Mad Bob Younger under control!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Bob here’ll kill a man for sneezing, and he’s
the best shot in the gang.</p>
<p><strong>head teller</strong>: Better than you, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Bob Younger taught me how to shoot!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now, we would like to get back to the
robbery.</p>
<p><strong>head teller</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: Damn, Loni, you’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>loni</strong>: Luckiest man in the West, now that I’m riding
with Jesse James!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: This has been a good year.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesse, we’re outlaws.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And we’re good at it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It got to you, didn’t it. All the killing in
the war. You need it now.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’ve killed your fair share of men.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If I could go back to farming –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s a lie. You could’ve bought a dozen
farms with the money we’ve stolen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t quit and leave you alone. I can’t
quit until you quit. Ma would’ve wanted it that way.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: We’re doing this for Ma.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe it started out that way. But now…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What do you want me to say, Frank? I was
killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding
out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than
farming.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A better life than the one you could have had
with Zee?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll bet you every dollar we’ve stolen that
she hasn’t read a single one of the letters you’ve sent her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You going to throw down on me, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Don’t do this, Frank. You know I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just do me a favor. Think about what this is
costing everybody. Not just the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You okay, Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You’re
too young to be drinking whisky.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to
drink.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off
and fight with you and Cole. Now it’s my turn.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Jim, you been with a girl yet?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Tonight? Why, I’m just getting ready to turn on
the Younger charm.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You been with a girl ever?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hell yeah! I been with… Uh, not exactly. It’s
just, I don’t want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all
these girls because you’re good looking and famous. You don’t have to
pay. They just look at me like I’m the baby brother. Don’t tell anyone,
okay Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I swear.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Tell you something else. I can’t drink that
good neither. I’m going to go outside and throw up.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I hope you don’t mind, Jesse James told me
your name.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, you were talking to Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Yes, but just so I could find out who you
were.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I hope I’m not being too forward.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I just though you were awful cute.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thank you, Miss – ?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Lyla Devereux.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Gosh, that’s a pretty name. Buy you a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Could we go upstairs and talk? It’s so loud
down here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why don’t we get a bottle of sherry to sip
while we talk?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: That is so gentlemanly of you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl
once.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t talk about it much, though.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: The final route for the railroad is
complete.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: I look forward to seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Parker.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What, sir?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, that. I’ll let Jenkins explain.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Jenkins.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: We’ve done a financial study of the
construction costs projected into –</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Jenkins.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: It’s cheaper to go around Jesse James, sir.
Even with the detour and the extra track. It’s just cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: So he’s won.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Every three months, the James Gang
circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a
job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give
family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: In English, Pinkerton.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: There are only four banks within that
travel radius which they have not robbed.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Can you put men at all four?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: No need. I have another tool at my
disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Why, their intense hatred of you, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: The things a fella has to do to get a little
respect around here…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You are a fine figure of a man.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen, Jesse, we’ve got a problem. It’s
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: He’s been full of vinegar lately.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s planning a job.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Listen, he’s my brother and I don’t want to
start trouble…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’ll be the biggest score yet.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What will be?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hyperion Bank, two day’s ride from Liberty.
They’ve got a hundred thousand dollars in railroad money just sitting
there.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Smells funny, it being mentioned in the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: If you’d read about it first, you’d have no
problems.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ve robbed just as many banks as you have! I
know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it’s an easy job.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re forgetting who’s in charge –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Oh, you’re in charge? We ain’t partners any
more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cole, he didn’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You taking sides against me, now, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: So being with me is being against you? Well,
we don’t want to do that! None of us poor idiots want to go up against
the famous Jesse James, greatest outlaw who ever lived!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That’s what the newspapers say. Weren’t for
Jesse James, this gang wouldn’t be able to find a goat’s ass with a
stick.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: You have got mighty full of yourself lately,
Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You think so. You all do? You?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Now the one time one of us comes up with an
idea –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I got us through the War all right.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And almost got hanged in peacetime.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Let them fight it out. The poison
needs to leave the wound, to heal.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is healing?</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Sometimes a wound will kill.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now you tell us.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Boys, we don’t want this.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m the better soldier, Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And I’m the better outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And you both hate the railroad. That’s what’s
important. We do this job, and Thaddeus Rains won’t dare come West
again.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What about that Rock Island bastard?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s his money. He’s putting up the payroll out
of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don’t you
Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Still smells fishy.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Then let me run the show, General Lee.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fine. We hit this bank.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’ll be smiling once you’ve got all that
money to spend, cousin. Cole Younger’s going to make everybody rich!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Nobody move! This is a robbery!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What the –</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Head for the end of the street!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A trap.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Another dozen out back.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They gonna rush us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’re just insurance in case we run.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Get inside, you –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: They’re all pinned down. Can’t even get to
the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Got any ideas, little brother?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh Lord.</p>
<p><strong>frank/cole</strong>: Oh Lord.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No time to gawk, boys, we got somewhere else
to be!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay, you’re gonna rest here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: That’s a long ride, Cole. We won’t be back
’til morning.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Then you better get going!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Bob, rip up some bandages.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Pass me some whisky.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: … too young for whisky…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: This time we’ll make an exception.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know,
from that time…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re gonna tell her when you’re resting up
in bed with her, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Jim, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Best time of my life. I was famous, y’know…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun,
made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jim was old enough…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: He was a boy riding with the most famous
outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Railroad burned him out too. You couldn’t
have stopped him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re a piss-poor liar for the smartest man
I know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A war against the railroad. What the hell
were we thinking?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sure it seemed like a good idea at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We’ll make them pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that
our blood’s been spilled, you’re gonna quit?!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Who’s next? You? Me? Bob?</p>
<p><strong>clell</strong>: We can’t exactly go back to our lives,
Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not telling you what to do. You want to
keep on following Cole, fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Go ahead. Ride on. But don’t come back when
you figure out you can’t farm with a six-gun.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Zee.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty
hunters and lawmen all over this county!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I had to see you. I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: She’s the most wonderful woman in the world.
Can’t get her out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: That’s… wonderful. It’s just… I thought…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: She’s beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest…
buck teeth in all of Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ve quit my outlaw ways. Come live in my
home and in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I would never have imagined us in a place like
this.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s why I picked it. We can start a whole
new life down here.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James?
Without all that excitement?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ve got you. You keep me busy. I figure
we’ll get over to the hotel… get checked in, cleaned up… then I’d like
to do something I’ve been thinking about for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Now wait a minute. There are certain things
that have to wait until after the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Driver, change of plans. Take us to the
nearest church.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What religion?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Whichever one has God in it, that’ll do
fine.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: This is unusual. Most of our marriages are
members of the congregation.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You don’t think God’ll mind, do you?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the
charitable. “Jesse Woodson James.” Jesse James? The Jesse James?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I could have lied I suppose, but I want this
marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I’m trying to start a new
life here. I’m depending on your…</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the
cloth.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Now let’s have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Right here in church?</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Communion.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Nobody move! This is a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The safe. Now.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Of course! Uh, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Where is Jesse James?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This here is the Younger Gang!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But the Youngers ride with Jesse James.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Did ride. No more.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: All right, all right. Jesse James never
yelled at folk…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is the best score yet.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s still taking too long. The people used to
snap to.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That was because of… the reputation the gang
had.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: As long as people think Jesse’s still riding,
we will never get the respect we deserve.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Cole, we’re outlaws. Not exactly the most
respectable job, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Leave me alone, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: “Hmm” what?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: “But the life of the James Gang wasn’t all
robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a
taste for the ladies… especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse
James.”</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: “Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of
Jesse James.” Only a dime in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Oh, I’m not finished. “When he sauntered into a
saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies
flocked around him like flies to a candied apple.” As I said. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Now, sweetie, y’all wouldn’t go believing one
of them silly dime novels, would you?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you’re
trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm
boy?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Aw, shucks, ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Stop it. This is just sad.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Swimming. Swimming is good.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Don’t turn around.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: If you don’t see it, it’s not real…</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Jesse James, you are under arrest!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They arrested Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How’d they –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I ain’t done –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Bob. I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Swear.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I swear –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Swear on Jimmy’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: Bob. You know Cole would never do such
a thing. He and Jesse are best friends. They are cousins, blood
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sorry, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re just upset about Jesse. We all are.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: My people know that when a brother
kills a brother, a great curse comes down on that man, and when he dies
he walks the desert as a dark spirit. I like Bob too much to let that
happen. If I find out you turned in Jesse, I’ll kill you myself.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: We’re moving you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: But I like the presidential suite.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Oh, it’s a similar room. But the hotel is
in Washington D.C. You’re not going to get a fair trial down here, in
front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So I’ll get a fair trial in front of a jury
bought off by Thaddeus Rains?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: That’s the idea.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Did you order our houses burned down?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Not that day. I am guilty of many things,
but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Was this you, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You almost ended my career before it
began.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Pity.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: How did you spot the ambush in
Torrell?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Last February?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You had all those cattle there, so I’d think
the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: The cows had a brand from a farm just five
miles out of town.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there,
shooting at me.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: I went myself to oversee the operation.
Didn’t help much.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit
after that one.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Oh. That’s nice to know. We’re going to
hang you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I figured.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Was it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and
been done with it.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: That’s what I would have done.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m not hanged yet.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: You cocky little bastard.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ahh, you’ll miss me.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: No, I’ll hang you. But I may miss you
just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: This is him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I remember you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re Parker. I remember you, too. You
killed my Ma.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: If you feel that way, I could always take
off the irons.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: You stole thousands. You cost me tens of
millions of dollars, months of lost construction. I wish I could hang
you every single morning for a century.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: You like that? Solid gold, my father had it
made when he started this railroad. He gave it to me when I took over,
I’ll give it to my son when he runs this company, and he’ll give it to
his son – The right type of men will always run this country, Jesse
James, and little men like you will always suffer. You have stopped
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Made you think twice about burning folks’
homes down now, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: We’ll speak again in Washington, you
insect.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You’re coming on the same train?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, tell you what. I’m going to have to pay
you a visit.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: Big words.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s a promise.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Hook him up.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Now the guns.</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: I don’t like it. We can handle
him.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: In the ten seconds we have been in this
car, I have seen you get close enough for Jesse James to grab your guns
at least three times. And I assure you, if he gets his hands on one of
your guns, you are all, and I mean all dead men.</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: He’s chained up.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: I’ll put that on your tombstone. The
guns.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hey, fatty.</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy
piggy!</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: What you sayin’ boy?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think I recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think I saw you leavin’ by the front door
just as I was coming in the back.</p>
<p><strong>burly detective</strong>: You shut up now, boy.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No, really. You’re wife said she needed some
help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn’t find your –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, she said you did that to her too.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Y’know, I could do this without the gun, but
it just makes things easier.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>rains</strong>: What the hell is that sound?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nice shot.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Thank you. Now go get my husband.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: There’s only four of them…</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Move you fools!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: He’s too important, James. They’ll set
the army on you. You and your wife.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That is a nice watch you got there.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I tell you what, I’ll buy that watch from
you, for the fair market price approved by the Department of the
Interior: one dollar.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: If I were you, I’d sell. After this, the
price goes…down.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Now every time you go to look at this watch
and it’s not there, you’ll remember: You can be stopped. Pass that down
to your son, instead.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Tennessee.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: The railroad has no business in
Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: I’d just as soon kill you, Jesse James.
But chasing you takes up too much of my time.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: You get arrested again, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: I can’t believe I had to blow up a train for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You are a hell of a woman.</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Don’t swear.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Missed you, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Missed you too, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You know, you gettin’ caught, right after
leaving us, some people thought –</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Pff. All we been through, the thought never
crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Things changed when you quit the gang. For
example, I’m now the one who says “Let’s ride.”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: He’s not bad at it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s tougher than it looks.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Where’d you get all these riders?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We didn’t. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife
makes a hell of an outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I think my wife and I might go down Tennessee
way, buy a farm. Goodbye, boys.</p>
<p><strong>comanche tom</strong>: You stay out of trouble, Jesse. Nobody
has as much luck as you used up today.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll meet you down there in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the
distraction back there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hell, they hardly even noticed us.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let’s ride!</p>
<p><strong>zee</strong>: Tennessee?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ll explain on the way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Y’know, Uncle Frank…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: …every time you tell that story, you stop
there. That’s not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know. But that’s how it should have ended.
Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together,
happy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Allow a man his version of the past. When you
get to be my age, you’ve got enough painful memories, you’re allowed to
soften a few of the edges up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sounds like he was a hell of a man.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That he was.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’re making him a hero now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But he killed a lot of men, too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can’t argue that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So what was he?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think… he was just a real interestin’ fella
to have around.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, your Ma’s probably holding dinner
for us. Once saw the woman blow up a train, don’t want to tick her
off…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Uncle Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How much of that story is true?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Everything but the boring parts.</p>
