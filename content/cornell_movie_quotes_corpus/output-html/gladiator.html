<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Do you think he’s really dying?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He’s been dying for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I think he’s really dying this time.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: He has to be bled every night now.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I’ve been so informed.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: If he weren’t really dying he wouldn’t
have sent for us.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Maybe he just misses us.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And the Senators. He wouldn’t have
summoned them if –</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the
road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: The first thing I shall do is honor him
with games worthy of his majesty.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: The first thing I shall do is have a hot
bath.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Why have we stopped?</p>
<p><strong>praetorian guard member</strong>: We’re here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Where is my father?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: He’s at the front, sir.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Is the battle won?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Don’t know, sir. They’ve been gone for
eight days.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: My sister wants a bath, take her to the
camp. Take me to my father.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Civilization at last. Gods preserve us.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: You would do as well to read the mind of a
rhinoceros.</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: These barbarians would rather drown in
blood than yield an inch. If I didn’t hate them so much I would admire
them.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: They simply will not surrender.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: A people should know when they are
conquered.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: At the first signal release the catapults.
We’ll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat.</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: General, I don’t recommend that. Our
cavalry might be caught in the flames.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I hope not, because I’m going to be leading
them.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Why don’t they know they’re already
dead?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Hold steady… steady…</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Steady…</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Brothers – I salute you! For Rome!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Maximus, you prove your valor again. Let us
hope for the final time here.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I don’t think there’s anyone left to
fight.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There are always people left to fight…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: But this night, at least, Germania is at
last defeated… What will you do now, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Should Caesar permit, I’ll go home. I’ve
been away too long. I’ve forgotten my wife’s face and I barely know my
son.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Stop… … You speak our language?</p>
<p><strong>german prisoner</strong>: You have been in my homeland for
twelve years. Of course I speak your language. So did my son, who you
murdered. So did my daughter, who you raped.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Come, Caesar…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No. Let him speak… … I am Rome, what would
you say to me?</p>
<p><strong>german prisoner</strong>: You are that sun, Rome, and your
time is over… You can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a
thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Now it is Rome.</p>
<p><strong>german prisoner</strong>: It will never be Rome. Not as long
as one German breathes.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No… Release him. Give him safe passage. Let
him go to his family.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: For the glory of the empire, sire.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yes. I remember.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: They honor you, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I don’t think they’re standing for me,
Maximus. They honor you.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Have I missed it?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Have I missed the battle?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’ve missed the war. We’re done here.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Father. Congratulations. I shall sacrifice
a thousand doves to honor your triumph.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Spare the doves and honor Maximus, he won
the battle.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: General, Rome salutes you and I embrace
you as a brother.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Highness.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Your Spaniards seem invincible. May the
Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always… Here, Father, take my
arm.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where’s your sister?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: She’s at the camp. She had no desire to
see the gore of the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it
brought her one step closer to the throne.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Caesar, you do the lady injustice.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s a foolish old cobra who doesn’t
recognize his own off-spring… I think… I should ride now.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So much for the glory of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: He’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Poor old man.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: If you’ll excuse me, Highness.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What, Gallus, losing your other hand?</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: Aye, General, they’re going to make a bronze
one for it. Long fingers this time.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: And the women of your village will crave
your touch even more.</p>
<p><strong>gallus</strong>: Ah, then you know the women of my
village.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>valerius</strong>: Valerius, General.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: The name suits you.</p>
<p><strong>valerius</strong>: Why am I dying?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You’re dying because you love Rome, as I
do.</p>
<p><strong>valerius</strong>: I’ve never been to Rome.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Neither have I. Rome for us lives here… …
it’s a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to
our children.</p>
<p><strong>valerius</strong>: It must be glorious, Rome. I’ve only seen
pictures. Is it a glorious place?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes, it’s a glorious place.</p>
<p><strong>valerius</strong>: It must be.</p>
<p><strong>falco</strong>: Hail, Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Stand up, Senators. That unfamiliar posture
doesn’t suit you.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: We live in supplication to your glory.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: All the while conspiring with that fat man
in Rome. How is the old monster?</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Still damning me to the four winds?</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: Still eager for your triumphant return to
Rome, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I would have silenced him decades ago – but
I just like him too much.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: If you want to stay on, I support you. So
do the men. I’ll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: It won’t be the Felix Regiment without
you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I’ll return after a season at home. Maybe
two.</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: That means after three or four more
babies.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: And you’ll be too fat from Vibia’s cooking to
get on your horse by then.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Should the Gods so bless me. I would be
thankful.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Hail, warriors. My congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>titus and quintus</strong>: Highness.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: My old friend, my father tells me you’re
returning to Spain?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: A pity. I’ll need men like you in my
army…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: There are larger division that might
appeal to you. Even the Praetorian Guard. You’ve never been to Rome.
Imagine arriving as head of the Praetorians! They have really splendid
uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: … And why not apply for entry to the
Senate?</p>
<p><strong>falco</strong>: A war hero with a handsome face and a strong
heart could go far.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: General Maximus, may I present Senators
Gaius and Falco. Beware of this Gaius, he’ll pour a honeyed potion in
your ear and you’ll wake up one day and all you’ll say is “Republic,
Republic, Republic…”</p>
<p><strong>falco</strong>: Have you never considered Rome?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: You’ve had my ear since we were children.
You could be a valuable ally in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: Are you a believer in Republicanism?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: There – I warned you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I’m a soldier, not a politician.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: If your heart lies with the people, I would
back you for the Senate. I’m sure Gracchus would as well.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Not a word about that sodomite
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: The august Senator Gracchus has been rather a
gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.</p>
<p><strong>falco</strong>: He’s a damned provocateur.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: He lives under the antiquated assumption that
the Senate should represent the people with vigor.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I won’t tolerate it. His incessant
criticism exhausts me. The man can speak for five hours without taking a
breath.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: He serves Rome best when he serves it with
honesty.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Enough… Maximus, I would like to inspect
the Felix Regiment at dawn. Please arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: My men have been fighting for five solid
days. They’re too busy dying to go on dress parade.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Of course, how foolish of me. Some other
time…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Caesar retires early tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: If only you had been born a man…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What a Caesar you would have made.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I think you would have been strong. I wonder
if you would have been just?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I would have been what you taught me to
be.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well, pretend to be my loving daughter
tonight and walk with me to my chamber.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This is a pleasant fiction, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Read this.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I never acquired the art, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Of course. No matter. In this letter I
denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after
my death.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: My son is not a moral man. You have known
this since you were young. He cannot rule.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Caesar, I am honored but –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: For twenty years I have been spilling blood.
For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered.
Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war. Four years
of peace in twenty. So perhaps I can be… forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: While I have been fighting, Rome has grown
mad and corpulent and diseased. I did this. And now I shall make it
right.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to
barbarian darkness. You brought civilization and justice to the farthest
–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I have brought the sword – nothing more!
Rome is far away and we shouldn’t be here. What matter is it to the Gods
if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls? What matter is it to
Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Winter, Maximus. It’s winter now…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There was a dream that was Rome. I can only
whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes.
It’s so… fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea.
Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen. Where every free
man has a voice. That was the dream… And I fear it will not survive the
winter.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Let’s just whisper here, you and I.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: If the dream is ever to live again the
people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them. That all the
Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest. And now that I
am dying I am going to give them that voice again.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You’re not dying.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I am, Maximus. It’s strange… I find as I
near the end I think little of the waning moments around me… instead I
think much of the past… and of the future. How will the world speak my
name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher? The warrior?
The tyrant? Or will there be a more golden sounding to my name? Will I
be the Emperor who gave Rome back her freedom?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Before I die I will give the people this
final gift. I will give them the Senate reborn. The voice of the people
empowered again, as it was always meant to be. It is my design that they
will elect the next Emperor. And I would put forward your name with my
backing.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Caesar, you do me honor – but your son has
pride of place for succession.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You are the son I should have had… Although
I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood
would have polluted you as it did Commodus. We’re a cursed bloodline. We
have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a
life without it. We can no longer even imagine a life without it.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Look at me, son.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Son… I know that one grove of your vineyard
is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome. I know one loving
word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire. But…
a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least
think about what he has said tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I shall, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’ll keep this letter to myself. I hope that
with the sunrise you will agree. And embrace me as a father.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You have always been my father.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla’s voice</strong>: He always favored you…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Even over his son.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Maximus, stop… Let me see your face.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: You’ve been crying.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I lost too many men.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: What does my father intend?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: You’re lying. I could tell when you were
lying even when we were children. You hate it.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I never acquired your comfort with it.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: True. But then you never had to. Maximus,
stop… … Is it really so terrible seeing me again?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No. I’m sorry. I’m tired from the
battle.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: And you are hurt to see my father
dying.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He will announce Commodus’ succession.
That’s why he summoned us. Will you serve my brother as you served his
father?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I will always serve the ideals of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Do you know I still remember you in my
prayers…? Oh yes, I pray… Ever since that day you saved me from drowning
off Capri. Do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant –
a Spaniard no less – touched the royal person, do you remember his
anger?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Mark this, Maximus: that is the man who
will be Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: May I be permitted to go, Highness?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: There was a time when you didn’t call me
“Highness.”</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: And there was a time when you were just a
little girl drowning in the sea. All that was a different life.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Very different… I wonder if it was
better?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: It was more honest.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I thank you for your prayers.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for
your guidance. Bring me your solace and your wisdom. Blessed Mother,
come to me in my dreams with the Gods’ desire for my future. Blessed
Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword. Keep them safe
until my return. Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold
them again and all else is dust and air. Ancestors, true bloodline, I
honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I search the faces of the Gods for ways to
please you… to make you proud… and I can never do it. One kind word –
one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight –
would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years… What is
it in me you hate so much? My eyes are your eyes. My hands are your
hands. All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar. Father.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Why does Maximus deserve what I could
never have? – Why do you love his eyes over mine? – I would butcher the
whole world – if you would only love me…</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: General – Maximus –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Quintus – ?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: The Emperor needs you. It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What is it? Is he ill?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Lament with me, brother, our great father
is dead. I want –</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: General, the Gods’ have taken the great
man and left me alone. My first desire as Emperor is that you take my
hand in friendship. I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above
all others. Stand with me.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: How did he die?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: How did he die?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: The surgeons say it was his breath that
gave out.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Take my hand, Maximus. I only offer it
once.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: How will the world speak your name now, old
man?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Hail, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What – ?!</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: Please don’t fight, Maximus –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Quintus –</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: I’m sorry, General, Caesar has spoken.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Quintus, what – ?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: I have no choice –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: My family?!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What about my family, Quintus?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: They will greet you in the afterlife.</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: Take him as far as the sunrise and then
kill him.</p>
<p><strong>assassin #1</strong>: All right, this is far enough.</p>
<p><strong>assassin #1</strong>: You two take him down there where no
one will find him.</p>
<p><strong>assassin #3</strong>: Come on, General…</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Have you ever done this before?</p>
<p><strong>assassin #3</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Killed a man with a sword?</p>
<p><strong>assassin #3</strong>: Not like this, exactly… this is good,
you can stop.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: It can be very messy – you could get blood
all over your armor. You don’t want to hack me up now. You want one
clean stroke.</p>
<p><strong>assassin #3</strong>: Would you kneel, General?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: One good stroke – you do know where, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>assassin #4</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: If you miss the spot there’ll be blood
everywhere. Quite a spray.</p>
<p><strong>assassins #3</strong>: All right, where?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Here – you don’t want to hit the vein on
the neck –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Put the point of your sword here… you want
one, good blow right at this spot –</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Even as the Gods curse this dark day with
clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow.
Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the
coming of a bright, new age for Rome. At my side, brothers, you shall
pull fresh glories from the heavens. At my side, brothers, you shall
know the adoration of the Gods. Doubly-dark is this day because my
friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to
deal with urgent matters of state…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Until his promised return I appointed
Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead. I salute you, Legionnaires!</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: Hail, Caesar!</p>
<p><strong>felix regiment</strong>: Hail, Caesar!</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Quintus, what is – ?</p>
<p><strong>quintus</strong>: Don’t speak of it. Never speak of it.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Am I in Hades?</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: For your wound…</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: For your wound.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: If you die in the wagons they feed you to the
lions… The lions are worth more than we are. I think we are worth more
than the zebras though. So they don’t feed us to them.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I’m not sure about the giraffe.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: Proximo, my old friend, see what I
have for you today – !</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Those giraffes you sold me won’t mate! All
they do is run around not mating! YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: I will make it up to you, Master. It’s
bargain day for you! Look, look, look – I have two lions and a panther –
hear how they roar for you! “Bring me home, Proximo!”</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: How much for the lot?</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: For you – 8,000 sesterces.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: For me – 6,000 sesterces and I want to see
their balls first. And you throw in those two slaves.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: What about this one? Look at the
arms!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Good teeth –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Where did you get those scars?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Are you a soldier?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Do you speak? –</p>
<p><strong>keep those damn flies off me!</strong>: He’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: 1,000 sesterces.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: My ass… You throw in this one and we’ll
make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: I have to eat, Master! He’s my finest,
I couldn’t let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total… I
tell you this one is prime. He’s a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my
men before he could be subdued!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: All right, let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I’ll give you 500 sesterces.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: No – no – 1,000!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Come, don’t quibble with your old friend.
I’ll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000.
And I’ll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights. She’s an
enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: How could I say no to my old friend
Proximo?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Slaves. I am Proximo, trainer of
gladiators. You live and die at my pleasure. Fight well and you will
live. Fight poorly and you will die. It is better to live.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Here you will be trained in the art of
combat. Here you will be given the tools to survive. Please my patrons
in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you.
Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches! Imagine fame beyond
your rude understanding of the word! All this can belong to the select
few who prove their worth in the arena.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: If… on the other hand… you disappoint me…
you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: And my jackals are always hungry.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Have you killed a man before?</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: You should eat. You’ll need your strength
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I’ve never killed a man. But I think you
have.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I almost killed once. The Romans destroyed my
village. I was with a hunting party and when we returned… I would have
killed every Roman in the world.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: If you don’t eat you will die.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: In the village I come from there was a man
once. He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles.
One of them ate his leg. He pulled himself to the shore and a lion
attacked him. It ate one of his arms. He dragged himself through the
desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye. So he only had one
eye. When he reached the village I sat with him. I said, “You have lost
a leg, an arm and one eye. You must have a mighty will to live.” He
said, “No, Lord, it’s just better than the alternative.”</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Life is a gift from our fathers to us. Who are
you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon?</p>
<p><strong>scribe</strong>: I know nothing of armaments and warfare! I’m
a scribe – I write down words! I can write down seven languages –</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Be still.</p>
<p><strong>scribe</strong>: I don’t – how do you hold the sword?! I’ve
never held a sword!</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: You point the sharp end at your opponent and
you shove it in his guts.</p>
<p><strong>scribe</strong>: I can’t – I –</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Proximo! You insult me with this carrion!
Chain him to someone else!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Don’t worry, noble Vibius, he won’t be
bothering you for long.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Dead guts! Dead guts! Dead guts!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Some of you say you can’t fight, you won’t
fight… They all say that… But one day you will pick up a sword and
thrust it into another man. And the crowd will cheer you and love you.
And you will love them for it. On that day… you will be a gladiator.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: In this life, we all die. All we can choose
is how we die. And how we are remembered. Be remembered proudly.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: No… … give the Spaniard to him. Give the
Scribe to Vibius.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Are we going to fight each other?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Make it 600 sesterces for each
decapitation.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #1</strong>: How many strokes?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #1</strong>: For the great Vibius, one stroke.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Done. 400 sesterces for two strokes.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #1</strong>: Who’s he with?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: A Greek Scribe.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #1</strong>: I’ll raise the wager.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Give me odds, friend.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter and
it is spreading… we have looting at the granaries… we have so much filth
in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable… we have Praetorian Guard
units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the
exchange –</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: My City Guard units have tried to curtail
these excesses but no constabulary can police the entire city. And the
Praetorians outnumber us two to one.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Rome dies as the Emperor plays at
beneficence. At least Nero gave us music!</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: Do you think he’ll listen to us?</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: It is his duty to hear the will of the
Senate.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Not to mention the damn traffic!</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: We honor Caesar with the laurel to show our
love and appreciation for his benevolence.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Caesar is honored to accept your tribute,
Citizen Scholar.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor
to oversee the education of the young. If I could leave no other legacy
than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed. Tutors,
you hold the future of Rome in your hands. Teach them well so that they
will bring honor to the Empire. I salute you.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Look at them, Senators… my truest gift to
Rome.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Darling children, to be sure, now if I may
proceed?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Very well…</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Caesar, your presence in Rome is an
invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have
beset the city since your father went to the wars. We would like to
–</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Peace, good Gracchus, peace…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: My beloved father was a careless shepherd
to his flock. I shall be a good father to my children. I shall remain in
Rome and show them how they are loved.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: With respect, sire, the people don’t need
love – they need law. The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to
begin addressing the corruption in the city – – starting with basic
sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter. If Caesar could study this and –</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: You see that’s the very problem, isn’t it,
my old, old friend? My father spent all his time at study. At books and
learning and philosophy…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: He spent his twilight hours reading
scrolls from the Senate. All the while, the people were forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: The Senate is the people.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I doubt many of the people eat so well as
you do, Senator Gracchus…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I doubt many of the people have such
splendid armor, Captain Marcellus. Or such fine mistresses, Senator
Gaius. No… only their true father knows what the people need. I shall
show them they are loved. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them
tightly –</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Have you ever embraced someone dying of
plague, sire?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: No. But if you interrupt me one more time
I assure you that you shall. I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the
past. I will give the people what they truly want. Starting this day I
will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum. I will give them bread. And they
will want nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: You want to hold games?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Not just any games, Senator! A series of
games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy! I
will subsidize the arena from this day forth – and I will culminate this
celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never
seen! A great spectacle to honor my father! Magnificent, unending weeks
of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius!</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: If I may, Caesar… how are you going to pay
for this?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: That is not your concern.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Respectfully, sire, taxation and import
duties are the exclusive province of the Senate –</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my
brother with these matters. Come to me.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: Games? He wants to hold games?</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: It’s madness.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: No… it’s not…</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: He knows who Rome is. Rome is the mob. He
will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted. And he will
takes their lives. And he will take their freedom. And still they will
roar. The beating heart of Rome isn’t the marble of the Senate. It’s the
sand of the Colosseum. He will give them death. And they will love him
for it.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I’ve wagered on you against the Celts –
ignore the others and go for them – there are two axe-and- net and two
long spear. Now the Celts aren’t used to the sun so you have the
advantage there…</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: And keep them moving, their lungs aren’t
strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax-men.
If you get all four there’s an extra bonus so don’t be distracted by the
Spartans…</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Butterfly?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Perhaps you’d like a woman?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Boy?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Gold?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Well, I have nothing left to offer you! A
man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me.
Personally, I’d grab them all and then grab some more because the Gods
are fanciful and take us at their whim. Does the Spaniard have any
needs?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: You fight like a soldier. You have wounds
like a soldier who has been on long campaigns. You eye the world around
you like an enemy. What is your name, Roman soldier?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Gladiator.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: And nothing more?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: In two days we leave for Rome.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Ah… so it’s Rome you want. Well you shall
have her, Gladiator. The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to
culminate in a grand spectacle. If you do well I shall become very, very
rich. If you do well enough I shall set you free. Is it freedom you
want?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Not even that.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: The Emperor – will he be there?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Oh yes. He’s apparently quite mad about the
games. Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again.
But what is good for you, Gladiator?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Have you – how does one meet the
Emperor?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: As a gladiator?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: One doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Except… If one has proven oneself in
battle. If at the end of the games you are the final man standing – the
Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword. The sword is your
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: He give it personally?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: He did to me… Our great father Marcus
Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You knew Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I didn’t know him. He touched me on the
shoulder. Just once. But that was enough.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: All right, Gladiator. We shall go to Rome
together and have bloody adventures. The Great Whore will suckle us
until we are fat and happy and can’t suck another drop. That is
Rome.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: All my desires are splitting my head to
pieces – there’s so much I want to do – but all my efforts to show my
children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate
–</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Quiet, brother…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Leave the Senate to me. Don’t trouble
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: All I want is to be a good father to my
people. Why don’t they understand that?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Shhh. The tonic will help…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Yes, just drink this down.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I must take a firmer hand with them. They
must know their father can be firm. As our father was firm with us.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Our father lost his way. His mistake was
believing the old songs of the “Republic.” We know better. So let the
Senate talk. They have no real power.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Yes… yes… you always know the way. You
were always so wise in these matters… You know if I didn’t have my duty
to Rome I think I should be an artist. I should go away and paint
pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Will you stay with me?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Still afraid of the dark, brother?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Still. Always.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: My dreams would terrify the world.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I’ll stay with you until you are
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And after… just sit with me. Keep me
safe…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He’s asleep. Be quick.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: We’ve taking a sounding, the Senate is
with us.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: But we are only words. We are air. We need
steel.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: The City Guard is faithful to the
Republic. But we don’t stand a chance against the Praetorians.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Can they be bought?</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: They are zealots – totally committed to
your brother.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Well, can they at least be rented for a
day?</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: I doubt it. He pays them exorbitant
salaries and lets them loot and extort as they see fit. The city belongs
to them.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: And they’ve started arresting scholars now.
Anyone who dares speak out – even satirists and chroniclers.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: And mathematicians and Christians. All to
fill the arena.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: And what pays for it? These games are costing
a fortune and yet we have no new taxes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: The future. The future pays for it…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He’s started selling the grain
reserves.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: That can’t be true…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He’s selling Rome’s reserves of grain. The
people will be starving in two years. I hope they are enjoying the
spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: Rome must know this.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: And who will tell them?! You, Marcellus?
You, Senator Gaius? Will you make a speech on the Senate floor
denouncing my brother? And then see your family in the Colosseum? What
town-crier would dare?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He must die.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: The Praetorians would only seize control
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: No – cut off the head and the snake cannot
strike.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Lucilla, Gaius is right. Until the City
Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing.</p>
<p><strong>marcellus</strong>: And I haven’t enough men.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: What about the army?</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: No Roman army has entered the capital in a
hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: So we do nothing?!</p>
<p><strong>lucius’ voice</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I heard voices…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: It’s all right, darling, you –</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Senator! What did you bring me?!</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: For you prince Lucius… a sea monster!</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty
times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians
they come across… now, where is Achaea?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Below Macedonia!</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Show me on the map.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Lucius, you go in now, I’ll be in
shortly.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Thank you, Senator Mountain!</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: You’re welcome, Prince Anthill!</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Peace child… One dark night the Gods will
light our path. They will give us the voice we need. Have faith in that.
Have faith.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Not what you expected?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Rome is nothing but a slaughter house. And
we are the meat.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Tradition. He watches over us.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Oh go on, it won’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Stop that! You’ll get some monstrous
disease and then you’ll be worth nothing to me!</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Do you think it will be much different? Here
in Rome?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Bigger arena. Same killing.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Are you scared for tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I never though it would be so easy to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: So you’re finally home.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: This isn’t my home.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: For all Romans… this is home.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Among my people we honor the soil of our home.
Our ancestors are in that soil. All their dreams live there. I will
never see my home again. The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the
dreams die.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Perhaps one day you’ll return.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: How can I go back? I am not what I was. When a
man kills for no reason, he has lost himself.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: … and the Emperor will have no more animal
battles today –</p>
<p><strong>trainer #1</strong>: You promised me a bear match,
Cassius!</p>
<p><strong>trainer #2</strong>: I have ten damned gorillas! You said
gorillas yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Talk to the man in the imperial box. Who
has the next slot…? – Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and Proximo – – Nice
to have you back, you piratical bastard – now listen, the Emperor wants
the Carthage spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: No – have pity, Cassius – !</p>
<p><strong>trainer #3</strong>: My men are too good for – !</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You give us the Carthage match or lose your
spot on the rotation – but don’t worry – gold is flowing from the
Emperor’s fingers.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #3</strong>: It’ll cost you –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I won’t do it for less than 100,000
sesterces – !</p>
<p><strong>trainer #4</strong>: 120,000! All I have is my best
Thracians!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: And I want to see this famous Spaniard of
yours – his reputation soars from the provinces. The people are eager
for him –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I won’t throw my Spaniard into a spectacle!
Damn you and damn the rotation!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You will and the price will be 90,000
sesterces each – – which you all know is exorbitant</p>
<p><strong>trainer #4</strong>: My Thracians are worth – !</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Give me your best, brothers. They die
before Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at
least one of your Thracians.</p>
<p><strong>trainer #4</strong>: 30,000?! On a Spaniard?! That provincial
sun has curdled your brain!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Then make the wager, you smug bastard!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: All right – there are three other teams,
four men each – You know what a Thracian looks like?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Ignore the others – go for the Thracians.
The sun is to the east – over the gate – keep your back to the gate and
you won’t have the sun.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What – ?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Hurry – !</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Die well and we’ll sing songs about you for
a generation.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: This day we reach back to hallowed
antiquity to bring you… THE FALL</p>
<p><strong>of mighty carthage…!</strong>: … On the barren armies of the
barbarian Hannibal! Ferocious mercenaries and warriors of all brute
nations bent on merciless conquest! Your Emperor is pleased to give you…
THE BARBARIAN HORDE!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: But on that illustrious day the Gods sent
against them Rome’s greatest warriors…! The very life-image of nobility
and glorious valor… who would on this day, and on these same arid
Numidian deserts, decide THE FATE OF THE EMPIRE… Your Emperor is pleased
to give you… THE</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Slave! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Why is he still alive?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: He shouldn’t be alive. That vexes me. I am
terribly vexed…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: There, that’s better. Do you like the
platform here?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I do too. Simple, elegant…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Father would have wanted something more
ornate but he’s dead now.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Maximus Meridas haunts me. I see Father
turning away from me and gazing at him. How many times did I suffer that
indignity, I wonder?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I’m going to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Oh, you’re too clever, Sister. Don’t tell
me part of you won’t weep for him.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: When he defies my brother the Emperor, he
defies me. But you shouldn’t send assassins.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: The people embraced him today. They will be
expecting his next match… … let him die in the arena like the slave he
is. Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: He wounded you deeply, didn’t he? Long
ago.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as
always, unerring.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I will fight with you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: This isn’t your battle.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Better to die for a friend than to die for
gold.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Enjoy yourself, Madame… General, perform
well and there will be riches for you.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by
the bravest champions.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I knew your brother would send assassins. I
didn’t think he would send his best.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Maximus, listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: My family were crucified and burnt while
they were still alive.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I knew nothing of that.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I wept for them.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Do you know what it is to be the daughter
of the Emperor? I learned on the night my father had my husband killed.
I loved my husband very much. Very… simply. He was a man who believed in
the Republic. He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome
and not conquering the world. One night my father had him strangled for
conspiring with the Senate. My father never spoke of it. I never spoke
of it. That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: My son will live. He will survive this
cursed bloodline. Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean –
but my son will survive. Empires come and go. Cities crumble to dust.
Only family matters.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: My son was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: So is mine.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I want your brother dead.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: My son will never be safe while he
lives.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: How do you plan it?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: The Senate is with us, and the City Guard.
We have growing power in the streets. But we need a leader. Someone the
people can –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: So the crown passes to your son.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: No. So that my son will be safe. So that we
may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. Look into my
eyes, Maximus, and believe what I say to you…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: By all the Gods, and in the name of my
father who loved you, and in the name of the husband I loved… I swear to
stand by your side in this now and always.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What is your son’s name?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Lucius Verus. Like his father.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I weep for him.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Commodus plans to kill you in your next
match in the arena. He’s planning something. I will pray for you. As I
have always done.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: … in his majestic charity the Emperor has
deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final
match. Returning to the Colosseum today… after five years in retirement…
Caesar is pleased to bring you… THE ONLY</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Gods! That old Homicide! The Emperor must
truly hate you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What can you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: He cheats.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: And from the rocky promontories and martial
bloodlines of Spain… representing the training lyceum of Proximo
Antoninus… I give you…</p>
<p><strong>maximus and tiger</strong>: We who are about to die salute
you.</p>
<p><strong>lucius’ voice</strong>: Is it true you’re a General…?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I was a General.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I saw you fight. The Carthage battle too.
I’ve never seen so much courage.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: It doesn’t take courage to kill.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: My father was killed.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He still comes to me in my dreams. Do you
have a father?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I had a father. He wasn’t really my father
but I cared for him very much.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I hope he comes to you in your dreams. My
father and I ride horses in mine.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Lucius, run along now. I need to talk to
the General.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Where is my army?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: … Maximus will summon his army from Ostia
and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside.
But he insists that the Senate be present.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: We’ve been ordered to attend.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: How many are with us?</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: About half. But once the tyrant is dead.
All.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: I want to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I’ll arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: And what of the Emperor?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He has withdrawn. He’s not eating. He
doesn’t go out. He won’t even see me… I don’t know what tempests rage
within him but…</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: We should fear for the blackest storm.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gaius</strong>: One question… who is to be the actual
Regicide?</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: You didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I will not kill another warrior. There is
no honor to it.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Maximus the Merciful! Maximus the
Merciful!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Tell him we will enter Rome on the first
day of Commodus’ festival.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: And they will march on Rome for you?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes. But this letter must go to the
lieutenant named Titus, no one else.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Captain Marcellus will take it. And his
City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome. Is that enough to face
the Praetorian Guard?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: The Felix Regiment will never be
defeated.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: I only have one question for you, General…
Why?</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: You will lead an army of your brothers on
Rome. Many will die. Why?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I want Commodus dead.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: That’s not the reason. Tell me the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Because one night an old man whispered to
me about a dream. I will die for that dream.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: I knew the old man well. And I loved him
very much. In our youth we would spend hours building that dream
together. After he went to the wars and lost his way… I was very cruel.
I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: You can have no idea how much that means
to me.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: Any man who will die for a whispered dream
deserves my respect. I honor you, General.</p>
<p><strong>centurion</strong>: Madame, the Emperor would like to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Caesar…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I am sorry to have kept you away… I needed
this time to think…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Of course…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I limited my world to these four walls so
as to let my mind free… again and again my mind settles on but one
question… What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome
prefer a slave in the arena to their father?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: It is my responsibility to make the world
as it should be. How is it I have made this world?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Brother, do not be influenced by the mob.
They are a great, faceless beast –</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: They are not “the mob,” Lucilla, they are
the people. They are my children and all I want to do is love them.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Our father loved Maximus… and I love him
still… yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they
love him for it. Just as Marcus loved him for it. Tell me why,
Lucilla.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: They see themselves in him. They throw in
their own sad dreams alongside his. They think he fights for them.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And what do I do but fight for them?! I
give them games to please them. I strangle dissent to give them peace. I
empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?!</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Say I should fight him, in the arena. Let
my children see who the Gods truly favor.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: And what if he should win?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: A God is more powerful than a man…</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Caesar, you let this unduly worry you. At
best he is a passing fancy – he is a name, an image on a banner,
ephemeral – he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears –</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: But I need to know – why do they love
him?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He will not kill in the arena. He is
merciful. As they all wish they were in their own hearts.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And for that moment in the arena they are
merciful too. For a moment… they are Gods. Offering life.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: But who can be more merciful than the
Emperor of Rome?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Brother… we’ve taken a sad path since we
were children at Capri, have we not?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: For my own part… I am sorry it came to
this. And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my
regret. I shall live with my sin for all my days.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: As will I, Commodus. As will I.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: As the first act of my contrition I offer
you the wooden sword of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Take it, brother. Stand at my side as a
free man worthy of your ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I only have ancestors because of you,
brother. You killed everything that ever lived alongside me.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Take it, Maximus. Let us heal that fatal
wound together.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: This is the new home you cursed me to. And
I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Will you always mistrust me?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Why don’t you ask your father that?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I have more power as a slave in the arena
than I could ever have as a free man. As the Colosseum goes, the people
go. As the people go, the Empire goes.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: You think this is power? I could show you
power, slave –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No, Caesar… I will show you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: The Felix Regiment will come from here.
We’ll face the body of the Praetorians outside – here. Once inside, my
archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the
Colosseum. I’ll enter and join you – we’ll attack here –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: – a covert assault from within.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: We’ll be killed.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: But if we aren’t… think of the glory. Do
you remember glory, Gladiator?</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: And if we die that day – we die free men
worthy of our ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: You didn’t know my ancestors. A rotten
bunch.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Then be worthy of him. The old Titan who
would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and
fat.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: And impotent.</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: If I die, I want a hundred whores at my
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Where is my sister?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden</strong>: She’s out, sir…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden</strong>: I… don’t know, Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Where is my sister?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Was it Centurion…? General…?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: A soldier knows a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: All that was a long time ago. Too much wine
and too many women. And too much money.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: This is who I am… You see? There was a time
I would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the
jaws of Hades all the while. There was a time my heart swelled to strap
on the armor of Rome. But now…</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Now I am just an entertainer.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You said something to me once. You said in
this life, we all die. All we can choose is how we die. And how we are
remembered. Do you recall those words?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Then be remembered proudly. This is your
time, Proximo. Stand at my side and be what you were. What you truly
are. One last time.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: You might have spared yourself the speech,
General. The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You pox-ridden bastard – !</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: I am the richest trainer in the Empire! And
I will let my gladiators do anything you like! Conspire away,
General!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: But I tell you – if you survive this
madness I want you to go into business with me. I’ll give you a quarter
of my holdings.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: A quarter?!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: A third. And not a hair more. And you’ll
have to start in the provinces! Cleaning up the lion shit!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You know, if you were half so awful as you
pretend, you’d be a terrifying man.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Lucilla –</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Don’t even say it. I know it’s dangerous –
but I had to see you. Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your
message as you instructed.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: He says the City Guard will be ready at the
south road at noon. They can only wait for an hour so –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You’ve told me this already.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Did I? All right then. So everything is
prepared. The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators
– the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Lucilla… why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Tell me honestly… please… do you think it
will work?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Do you think we’ll all die?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Will you swear something to me?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Will you swear it on the memory of your
son?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: By all that you have ever loved… swear that
if you survive you will take my son out of Rome. Swear that you will go
far away and never return.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: And if I should not survive… swear to me
that you will honor my family in your prayers always.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Had I not been the daughter of Rome…</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Shhh… my heart breaks enough.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Sister… join us. I’ve been reading to dear
Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I’ve been reading too.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Yes, he’s a very smart little boy. He’ll
make a grand Emperor one day.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Join us, sister.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: We’ve been reading about the great Julius
and his adventures in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: She killed herself with a snake!</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And just wait until you hear what happened
to some of our other ancestors! If you’re very good, tomorrow night I’ll
tell you the story of Emperor Claudius. He was betrayed! By those
closest to him… … by his own blood… they whispered in dark corners and
went out late at night and conspired and conspired…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: But the Emperor Claudius knew that they
were up to something dire. He knew they were busy little bees. And one
night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said:
“Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike
down those dearest to you. You shall watch as I bathe in their blood.”
And the bee knew he spoke the truth, for the Emperor always speaks the
truth. And what do you think happened then, Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I don’t know, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: The bee told him everything.</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Release them! Release them all!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Come –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: If you want to live – follow me –</p>
<p><strong>vibius</strong>: Go, Spaniard! We’ll show these Roman dogs
how gladiators fight!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: All the old gladiator schools have tunnels
to the Colosseum – most have long since collapsed –</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: How did they know?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: We were betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: I’ll stay here. In case they follow.</p>
<p><strong>juba</strong>: Go! Bring us the army!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Quickly –</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Down that corridor is the butchery – the
blood sloughs lead to the Tiber. Gods watch over you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You’re not coming?</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: They are killing my men!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: Gods… they’re killing them all.</p>
<p><strong>gaius’ bedroom</strong>: Gaius and his wife are yanked awake
and hauled out.</p>
<p><strong>christian home</strong>: A congregation of Christians is
chained together, their secret altar smashed.</p>
<p><strong>cafe</strong>: Greek Scholars are hauled away from their
scrolls.</p>
<p><strong>street theater</strong>: Actors are dragged off in the midst
of a performance.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus’ steam room</strong>: Gracchus is enjoying grapes
with his handsome catamite. A unit of Praetorian bursts in. Gracchus
looks at them. Sighs.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What is that fire?</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Why that’s a bonfire, Lucius. I arranged
it just for you.</p>
<p><strong>praetorian</strong>: Caesar…</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Oh… that’s for my sister.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: By all the Gods…</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Old friend…</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: You’re returned from Hades! By all the
Gods!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: Rome… This is the day that was foretold.
This is the day when your father takes away all fear… With these hands I
shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in
peace. From this day forth let it be known that I, Lucius Aelius
Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality. That I, Lucius Aelius
Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place… at the side of the
Gods.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: And as a righteous God, I shall ever
protect you. I shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp
it to my heart. So I have spoken! And let the heavens tremble at my
might!</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: This day I reclaim Rome for her people. I
shall give you the rebirth of your Empire! Reborn and cleansed of her
enemies!</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: I will make a new Rome! Founded as it was
at the beginning! Archers –</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Throw down your weapons or we will kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: As it was at the beginning so is it now.
The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us, again ravage our
enemies – AND BRING US A WORLD</p>
<p><strong>commodus</strong>: So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of
Mars, so shall it be for us! The great She-Wolf will –</p>
<p><strong>lucilla</strong>: Remember your mother.</p>
<p><strong>centurion body guard</strong>: Caesar – we must go – !</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Where are they going?!</p>
<p><strong>proximo</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: For my wife!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: For my son!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: For my father!</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: We who are about to die salute you.</p>
<p><strong>gracchus</strong>: General, the purple is yours if you so
desire. The Senate will support you.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Rome… you are better than this. Look inside
yourselves. I challenge you to find your true voice. Help the Senate
speak for you. Make them your champion… And dare to think what could
be.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I give you back the dream.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: When everything has calmed down, lead an
orderly withdrawal. Take them home.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: It doesn’t look it now… but soon we’ll have
it growing again… Next year there will be vines, and then there will be
grapes… It will be alive.</p>
