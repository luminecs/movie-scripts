<p><strong>cholly</strong>: After I hit the number that woman wasn’t no

<p><strong>cholly’s voice</strong>: She says I’m cheap cuz I won’t cop
her a diamond ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap black
sunovabitch to boot.</p>
<p><strong>toomer</strong>: And when a black woman call you a cheap
black sunovabitch you’ve been called a cheap black sunovabitch.</p>
<p><strong>cholly</strong>: Will you let me tell it?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Where’s Homeboy?</p>

<p><strong>toomer</strong>: Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh,
Homeboy?</p>
<p><strong>cholly</strong>: Man, don’t scare him more than he’s scared
already. Ain’t too bad…</p>
<p><strong>cholly</strong>: …Like anything else. First time a chick gets
her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you
can’t give her enough. Right, Homeboy?</p>
<p><strong>cholly</strong>: Git his forehead and eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>cholly</strong>: Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes
shut.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I thought you said it was gonna sting… this

<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Don’t fight me, man. Let me git it out.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn
around.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Well, all right, then.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, all reet, then.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: When my mother was pregnant with
me, she told me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback surrounded our
house in Omaha.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come on, baby, let’s show ’em how.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Hey, man, gimme some skin.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Shorty, this is Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: ’Lo. I’ve got to freshen up.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Now you come back.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: That’s a fine chick.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Fine as May wine.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Except she live on the hill and got a
grandma.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Make it too easy and it ain’t no fun.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Why don’t you take your little girl home,
Red, and come on back?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I better not come in.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I ain’t stupid.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I mean it’s late, baby.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I know where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow,
need my rest.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What for? I ain’t white and I don’t put
out.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: ’Night, Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen
white breasts like these?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sheeet, you ain’t. I had aplenty.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: …That isn’t a whore?</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: That’s alright. Baby, take your time.
Sophia’s not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don’t run.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Shhhh! I don’t like women that talk.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Who wants to talk?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t you know, you can’t hump the
Bogart.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Eat lead, coppers.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Bang, bang. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for
size.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I forgot to tell you I’m wearing a
bulletproof vest.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The hell you are.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I’m tired of always playing the cops. I
wanna be Bogart sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re too small to be Bogart.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I’m not too short to be Cagney.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ahhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy,
rotten, stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat bastard would shoot
a man in the back.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: He use to be a big shot.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What you mean took his own life?!</p>
<p><strong>holway</strong>: I’m sorry, ma’am. You heard the verdict. A
man bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay down on the tracks
and kill himself! We merely act on the verdict. We don’t make them.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Do you pay or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>holway</strong>: Read the policy, ma’am. It clearly
states.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: You like ’em scrambled soft or hard,
sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Sweetie, they’re almost ready.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You hear me, girl?</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: You the man.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You better believe it.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: You evil this morning.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What’s your story, baby?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Feed me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah, girl; that’s your story. When you

<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You will, baby – if the time come.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sure wish your mama and papa could see you
now. And that ofay you gonna marry.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You
got class and you’re smart.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: All them books you read and you still don’t
know nuthin.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I do know I love you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there’s no
one around. Now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks
say you’re running around town with her.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right,
’cause your grandma’s smarter than ya think.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: She raised me, my mother died when I was six.
Is your mother alive?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah, she’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You know how dumb I was? I used to think
that “Not For Sale” was a brand name.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne’s voice</strong>: I did knock.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Did you hear me say come in?</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: There’s no point in fighting about it.
I’m sorry. May I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: As you nice enough to ask, we’ll git you
one.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: It’s the same questions, Mrs. Little.
Since the death of your husband–</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: – there is a serious question as to
whether –</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: These are my children. Mine. And they ain’t
no question. None.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor
is the only kindness.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: Your control over your children,
therefore–</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Did you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>miss dunne</strong>: You’ll regret this, Mrs. Little.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: If you don’t move out through that door,
you’re going to be past all regretting.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: We were parceled out, all five of
us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman’s house. She
was in charge.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swerlin</strong>: This is your room, Malcolm. I know
you’ll keep it clean.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swerlin</strong>: This is Malcolm, our new guest. We’ll
treat him like a brother.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: I was special. The only colored kid
in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: I didn’t know then that I was a
nigger.</p>
<p><strong>mrs swerlin</strong>: He’s bright.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: They talked about me like</p>
<p><strong>ostrowski</strong>: The important thing is to be realistic.
We all like you. You know that. But you’re a nigger and a lawyer is no
realistic goal for a nigger…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But why, Mr. Ostrowski? I get the best
grades. I’m the class president. I want to be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>ostrowski</strong>: …Think about something you can be. You’re
good with your hands. People would give you work. I would myself. Why
don’t you become a carpenter? That’s a good profession for a nigra.
Wasn’t your pa a carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s not the end of the world, Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I said it just as plain, I said, don’t let
them feed that boy no pig, because he got enough of the devil in him
already. I told her she ain’t got no reason talk to me that way cuz’ my
hair blow in the wind. You want my skin. All right, I’ll give it to you.
I’ll scrape it off. See how you like it.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Nigger, shut up so we can hear.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: C’mon, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>waiter #1</strong>: Turn it up, Tully.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: It is up. Fool be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>waiter #2</strong>: Tully, move the antenna. . . .</p>
<p><strong>waiter #3</strong>: This Mick is tough.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Joe is just playing possum. He’s waiting for
an opening.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: A left jab to the jaw and a right
cross, scored by Louis and Conn is hurt, as Louis rips a right to the
jaw. Conn is staggering, but he won’t go down. Conn bops a left hook,
he’s reeling around the ring. Louis hooks a left and a right to the jaw
and Conn is down.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: He’s taking the count, four, five,
six, seven, he’s on his back, eight, nine, he’s getting up, no! The
referee says it’s over. The bout has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What in hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Nothing, Mr. Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Got a lot of hungry customers out there.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Yes sir, Mr. Cooper, soup done finished.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: On my way, Mr. Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: The name is Mr. Cooper and don’t you forget
it. Mr. Cooper.</p>

Louis, but what a fight Billy Conn gave.</p>

<p><strong>hustler</strong>: Hey, man, hundred-dollar ring – diamond;

<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The word is excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Look, country boy, you shouldn’t have been in
my way.</p>

<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Daddy, where’s my money?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What you talking?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You owe me six big ones.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: 1, 2, 8 hit, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You din’t have no 1, 2, 8.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Was you that high? Old man, I threw the
slats at you. I said to combinate me.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You never had it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The bitch was there.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Shit, what else she gonna say?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby.
You done slipped.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I’m
buying.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I ain’t drinking hot piss with you. Come on,
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Be right there.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Got to be a first time, daddy-o.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: He gonna, check the collector he turn into.
His rep is on the line, boy, and so’s yours. If you lying, one of you is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ain’t gonna be this mother.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You’re a damn liar.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s me or you, ain’t it, Pops?</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ll give you back the 600.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I don’t want your money.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m wearing, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: There’s two guns on you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And every cat’s watching, ain’t they? It’s
a toe-down.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That’s what it is. Walk on out.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let Billie finish.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: You had the number.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep
the faith, and tell Billie I’ll see her later.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: The dirty yellow rat bastard.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Don’t push it. You way ahead. You back on
top. That boy loves you, man.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: What you say?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: He gave it to you, Archie. He did.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Somebody out there. Wake the children.</p>
<p><strong>black legion leader</strong>: Boy, good thing we’re good
Christians. Nigger, it’s time for you to leave this town.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: This here is ’pose to be a free country.</p>
<p><strong>black legion leader</strong>: Rev, we warned you ’bout that
Garvey preaching, stirring up the good nigras here. Boy, next time
you’re a dead nigger.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I ain’t a boy. I’m a man, and a real man don’t
hide behind no bedsheets.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Earl, I know you a better shot than that.
You shoulda killed ’em all, shot ’em dead.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Just wanted to scare ’em, they won’t be
bothering us no more.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They won’t be here no time soon. I’m a
MAN!</p>
<p><strong>passenger’s voice</strong>: Somebody get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>motorman’s voice</strong>: No doctor, get him a priest.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: My father’s skull, on one side
was crushed in, and then laid across some tracks, for a streetcar to run
him over. His body was cut almost in half. My father, Earl Little lived
two and a half hours in that condition. Negroes were stronger than they
are now.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Man, I’m glad we got you out of there. With
West Indian Archie on your ass, your name on the wire – Boston the best
goddam place in the world for you – things are too hot and it’s not even
summer.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: We’ll take it easy. I got a place fixed up
on Harvard Square. How’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah. Cool it and lay dead for a while,
Homeboy. And don’t worry none.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: Like every hustler I was
trapped. Cats that hung together trying to find a little security, to
find an answer – found nothing. Cats that might have probed space or
cured cancer – – all victims of whitey’s social order.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: You got to eat somethin’, Red.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: You want eggs, baby?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I ain’t doing bad.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, the name musicians ain’t got shit. How
you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman
can’t afford it; my homey ain’t got it. How about you baby? What you
got?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Jesus, Red, she’s just a kid.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Jesus ain’t got nothin’ to do with
this.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Surprise you, baby? Well, that’s the way it
is. What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. Let me have it. All
of you–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want
out say so.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: How about Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who’s Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’m half wop, half nigger and ain’t afraid of
no one.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What can you do?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: You name it, feller.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon
Hill.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That ain’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Tell him about Baldy.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah. This rich ofay, like he’s 60. I give him
a bath on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So what about him?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: So? The man got silver, china, rugs–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Might be all right.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got
my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You want to be the head man?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Head nigger in charge?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’m the man.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, baby. Let’s flip for it. Flip
this.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your flip, baby.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: Red, for God’s sake–</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Christ, Red, no–</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: I can’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for
you?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you
got it! You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t never try to cross someone who ain’t
afraid to die.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: You the man!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: All right. We’ll start with Old Talcum
Powder. You draw the house, where everything is. You and Peg go out and
buy them tools like I told you. We hit tonight on account of in the
daytime some of us got that high visibility. Ya dig?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: What did you do, Homey, palm it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Beacon Hill survey.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: We’re doing a survey for the Athenaeum
Society – We wondered if you’d permit us to include your collection in
the catalog of Great New England Antiques–?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crawford</strong>: Now these are my prizes. My Paul
Revere silver coffee service.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Lovely, just lovely.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.crawford</strong>: And my husband’s collection of
scrimshaw should be included.</p>
<p><strong>sophia</strong>: May we see it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crawford</strong>: Won’t you step this way?</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: The average first offender gets
two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That’s what Sophia
and Peg drew–</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Two years in the Women’s Reformatory at
Framingham.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: But our crime wasn’t burglary.
It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Burglary, count one – 8 to 10 years; count
two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years…</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: Fourteen counts of 8 to 10
years.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The sentences to run concurrently.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: Shorty thought he hit us with
114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum
sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The
date was February 1946. I wasn’t quite 21. I had not yet begun to
shave.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Crichlow.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Looka Satan.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I see him.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He bout to bust.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: No, he’s not gonna bust. But he’s not gonna
fix his face to please them, neither.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Harrington.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: Yeah. Lucky Seven.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Little.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: State your number.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Little.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: He’s a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a
break.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: 0kay, I’ll give him a break. Now state
your number, Little.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I forgot it.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Can you read, boy? Thass your
number.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: Now say it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m Malcolm Little, not no goddam
number.</p>
<p><strong>guard wilkins</strong>: Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you
is.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: Two days in the hole. Take him.</p>
<p><strong>fourth prisoner</strong>: A 551613, sir.</p>
<p><strong>guard cone</strong>: Time’s up. Get on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>trustee’s voice</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Do you know what a friend you have in
Jesus, son?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the
Virgin Mary, both, and shove ’em.</p>
<p><strong>guard cone</strong>: All right, Little. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I know how you feel. Like you want to lay
down and die.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Put it in a cup of water. It’s nutmeg.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: You need something. It’s not a reefer, but
it’ll help some.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, get outa my face. I ain’t nobody’s
punk.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Sit down or it might knock you down.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If you ain’t trying to punk me, what’s your
hype?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I can show you how to get out of prison. And
it’s no hype.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Talk, daddy, I’m listening. Hey that ain’t
bad. You got some more?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: That’s the last stuff you’ll ever get from
me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What did you give it to me for then?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: ’Cause you needed it. ’Cause you couldn’t
hear me without it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What in the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I think you got more sense than any cat in
this prison. How come you are such a fool?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You ain’t lying.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: When you go busting your fists against a
stone wall, you’re not using your brains. Cause that’s what the white
man wants you to do. Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, you been locked up too long, everybody
conks. All the cats.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Why? Why does everybody conk?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cause I don’t want to walk around with my
head all nappy, looking like–</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?!
Why don’t you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of
being black?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I ain’t said I’m ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Leggo. I got to wash it out.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Let it burn. Maybe you’ll hear me then.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, you better get off me.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all
that poison into your hair, into your body – trying to be white.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, I don’t want to hear all that.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I thought you was smart. But you just
another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit
with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and
he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain’t white.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: The question is, who are you? You are in the
darkness, but it’s not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into
the light.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Elijah who?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison.
Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I
thought you were smart.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: You taking the yard?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: What you sniffing around for? I told you I
gave you your last fix.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I ain’t never seen a cat like you. Ain’t
you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: What’s he gonna do to me he ain’t already
done?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You the only cat don’t come on with that
“Whatcha know, daddy” jive; and you don’t cuss none.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I respect myself. A man cuss because he
hasn’t got the words to say what’s on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Tell you this: you ain’t no fool.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Don’t con me. Don’t try…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Don’t con me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you do with your time?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I read. I study. Because the first thing a
black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind.
Quit taking the white man’s poison into your body: his cigarettes, his
dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s what Mama used to say.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Your mama had sense because the pig is a
filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens
if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin’? I pulled a hustle
once and got out of the draft.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I’m telling you God’s words, not no hustle.
I’m talking the words of Elijah, the black man’s God. I’m telling you,
boy, that God is black.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What? Everybody knows God is White.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Did you ever study anything wasn’t part of
some con?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What the hell for, man?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting
for you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, okay. Show me, man.</p>
<p><strong>dictionary</strong>: Black, , adj. Destitute of light, devoid
of color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly dismal or gloomy, as
“the future looked black.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: You understand them words?</p>
<p><strong>bembry’s voice</strong>: Read it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t make out that shit.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile,
forbidding – as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black
cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.</p>
<p><strong>dictionary</strong>: See also blackmail, blackball,
blackguard.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hey, they’s some shit, all right.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Now look up “white.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: White , adj. Of the color of pure
snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The opposite of black,
hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent,
harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s bullshit. That’s a white man’s book.
Ain’t all these white man’s books?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: They sure ain’t no black man’s books in
here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then what you telling me to study in them
for?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: You got to learn everything the white man
says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and
read behind their words. It’s buried there. You got to dig it out.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, how’m I gonna know the ones worth
looking at?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I’ll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of
these can’t nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph.D. with their
suspenders dragging the ground with degrees.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Man, I’m studying in the man’s book. I
don’t dig half the words.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Look ’em up and and out what they mean.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where am I gonna start?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Start at the beginning. Page one, the first
one. Here–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant-eating
African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Read it and keep on reading.</p>
<p><strong>dictionary</strong>: Abacus, noun. An ancient and primitive
Chinese counting device.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: If you take one step toward Allah, He will
take two steps toward you.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes’s voice</strong>: Closing. Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: You studying to be the first colored
President of the States?</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: You taking the yard or not?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>guard barnes</strong>: Then give me a butt.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Take ’em. I don’t smoke no more.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ole Pete ain’t much in the head, but he can
lay in there with the wood.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Lemme tell you about history: black history.
You listening?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You pitch, baby; I’ll ketch.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: The first men on earth were black. They
ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that
we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like
that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: This a helluva game. Somethin’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: 10 to 1; we murdering them, Din’t you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie
Robinson and we pounding the hell out of them, celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How bout that?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Sure, white man throw us a bone and that’s
supposed to make us forget 400 years.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: A black man playing big league ball is
something.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I told you to go behind the words and dig
out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile – and now they let
one black man in the majors. That don’t cancel out the greatest crime in
history. When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains – 100,000,000 of
us – broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Little.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: No. That’s the name of the slave-master who
owned your family. You don’t even know who you are. You’re nothing. Less
than nothing. A zero. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not Malcolm Little and I’m not
Satan.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe
of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man
named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then the devil is white.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I knew you’d hear me. The white man is the
devil. All white men are devils.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I sure met some.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: No. Elijah Muhammad does not say “that white
man is a devil.” He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All
white men.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Have you ever known a good white man in all
your life? Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn’t evil?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: The body is a holy repository.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I will not touch the white man’s poison:
his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: A Muslim must be strikingly upright.
Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the
light.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I will do it.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: But the key to Islam is submission. That is
why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We
bend our knees in submission.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt,
implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I want to, Bembry, but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: –the hardest and the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt,
implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I want to, Bembry, but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: –the hardest and the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know what to say to Allah.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob
somebody’s house.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Tell Him that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to
save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I want to. God knows I want to.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: I received a letter that day
from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The Messenger of Allah wrote me, a
nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.</p>
<p><strong>voice of elijah</strong>: I have come to give you something
which can never be taken from you: I bring you a sense of your own
worth, the worth of one human being. The knowledge of self.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: It was like a blinding light and
I became aware that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark suit and
on his face I saw a pain so old and deep and black I could scarcely look
at him. I knew I was not dreaming. He was there.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I tell you that the most dangerous creation
of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose. You do not
need ten such men to change the world. One will do. The Earth belongs to
us, the Black man and whatever is around it, and on it and in it.
Praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again, our self and
our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN,</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: And suddenly as he came, he was
gone.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is
all-seeing, all-understanding.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: We are told that Saul, on the
road to Damascus, heard the words of truth, he fell from his horse. I do
not liken myself to Paul, but I understand. It happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the
merciful to whom all praise is due.</p>
<p><strong>bembry’s voice</strong>: Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back in
the bosom of Islam, praise Allah…</p>
<p><strong>bembry’s voice</strong>: You write thanking me. Don’t thank
me. Praise Allah. He did it all.</p>
<p><strong>simmons</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Dear Bembry. Please thank the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money and tell him I have not written
him because I have not yet proven myself.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: But I have written everyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Look like Homey got himself a brand new
hype.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: “I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the
President, but for some reason I haven’t heard from them”…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Tell the Messenger of Allah that I
have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face.
I greet you with the ancient words: “As Salaam Alikum.”</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Wa-Alaikum Salaam.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: P.S. I finally worked my way
through the “Z’s”…</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Are there any questions?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on
religion.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: I see this has become a struggle
between good and evil. Satan has a question.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn’t
want to say which one of us is what.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Why don’t you just ask your
question?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’ve been talking about the disciples.
What color were they?</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: I don’t think we know for
certain.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They were Hebrew, weren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Just what is your question?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What color were the original Hebrews?</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: I told you we don’t know for
certain.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Then we don’t know that God was white.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Now just a moment, just a moment–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But we do know that the people of that
region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the
Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I’ve studied drawings and
photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area
who was not black.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain gill</strong>: Just what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not saying anything, preacher. I’m
proving to you that God is black.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: God is black.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: My son, you’ve been a thief, drug dealer and
a pimp and the world is still full of temptation. When God bragged how
faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God’s protective hedge
around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will
curse his maker. Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I believe you
will remain faithful.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How many you turning out?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: 500.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother
Earl. He just joined the Nation.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We can always use another good brother.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m a willing servant for Allah.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You think you are Christians, and yet you
see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on
trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil
act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to
be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in
Beulah’s land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your
knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus.
Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man’s
true religion.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And that the white man is the devil. Yes,
God is black and you are made in His image and don’t know it. That’s how
brainwashed you are.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Have you ever seen a black man who
wasn’t down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the
white devil enjoys right here on earth?</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: The Harlem Council fights for rat control,
for rent control and for community control of our schools.</p>
<p><strong>second speaker</strong>: If the man behind the counter ain’t
black, don’t go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think black. Buy
black.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come to our Temple and hear the truth.
Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead,
spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black
man back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: My beautiful sister, for you are
beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful.
You work in the white folks’ kitchen so I don’t have to tell you that
they’re devils.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We’re not American, we’re Africans who
happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our
will from Africa. We didn’t land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Put an end to your begging. No more
“Please, Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your
table, kindly, sir.” We are a nation, a great nation and don’t need a
thing from them.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I got to hand it to you, Homey. That’s the
best preacher hype I ever did hear.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It isn’t a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I
said: join us.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Come on, baby. I don’t pay that shit no
mind.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you
should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How
about a snort?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ve been clean for twelve years,
Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is – I
ain’t had enough stuff yet, I ain’t et all the ribs I want and I sure
ain’t had enough white tail yet.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How’s the rest of the gang? You seen
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Well, Sammy’s dead. Yeah, fell over in the
bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in
his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: How about Old Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>shorty’s voice</strong>: Hooked on horse. Been in and out of
Lexington Ave times.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: You seen Sophia?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I ain’t seen Archie, but the vine tells it
he’s living somewhere’s in the Bronx. If you can call it living.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Git the hell away, you bitch, I’ll pay you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hello, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: My man, Red. Come on in, man. Hey, I can’t
make it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Take it easy, baby.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: That really you, Red?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You saved my life, Archie. Running me out
of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I
have to thank Allah.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: I wasn’t gonna shoot you, baby. It was just
my rep, that’s all. And don’t shit me now, but did you have that number?
Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. The thing
is we got to get you back on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain’t been
figured yet. All I need’s a stake and a chance–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Can you use a few bucks? I ain’t got much,
but–</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: No, man, I’m doing okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Take it easy. Lay down and don’t think
about it.</p>
<p><strong>archie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You could of been something, Archie, but
the devil got to you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Women who could be mothers,
teachers, scientists…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –and what has the white devil made of them:
dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and
say, “My kind commits history’s greatest crime against your kind every
day of your life.” But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with
his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you’ve had it, then stand up and
come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He ought to try to make it a little easier,
Brother Bembry.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Why don’t you try telling him that, Sister
Betty?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our
loudspeaker is heard on the street?</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: I’m sure we can. This is a new sister,
Sister Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what
Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She ate.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sure I’ll speak to your class. But I’m a
hard man on women. You want to know why?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you want to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If you want to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy
flesh. I’ve seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by
women.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to
talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to
cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by
the woman who slept in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose
marriage?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not
practice celibacy. If a woman is the right height for a man, the right
complexion, if her age is half the man’s plus seven, if she understands
that man’s essential nature is strong and woman’s weak, if she loves
children, can cook, sew and stay out of trouble–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I think you’ve made your points, Brother
Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What points?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That you haven’t time for either marriage or
eating–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you’ll start eating, there is a question I
have. Go ahead. Start.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let me explain. No. I’ll do better than
that. I’ll show it to you. Scientifically. But it’s demonstration purely
in the interest of science, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>betty’s voice:</strong>: Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm.
Purely scientific.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Notice especially the claw, the jaw and the
skull formation. This is the rat. This the mole. Here you have the
aardvark and the boar…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: …All members of the pig-rodent
family.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I see your point.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So it is not a matter of the breeding
conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Could we sit down someplace?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m sorry. I’ve had you on your feet for
hours.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’ve been on your feet for days. And didn’t
even finish your salad.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You’re the strawberry soda and you’re the
hot fudge sundae.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s something I haven’t done in fifteen
years.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice
cream soda.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Delicious.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: 0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you.
Brother Bembry briefed me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh? Purely scientific interest I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re from Detroit, near where I come
from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You’re studying nursing and
having trouble with your family.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They want you to quit the Muslims or they
won’t pay your tuition, isn’t that it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You have enough worries of your own.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, good Sisters are rare. We need every
one. Tell me something: how tall are you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Just an idle question.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If it’s just idle, I won’t answer it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How old are you, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s a few things you don’t know about
women, Brother Malcolm. They’re possessive and vain.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And dogged when I set my mind to
something.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What have you set your mind to?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good
wife.</p>
<p><strong>sidney’s voice</strong>: Brother Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Brother Johnson was attacked by the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: There was a scuffle. The Brother was
watching.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: The cop says, “Move on.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The Brother didn’t scatter fast enough for the
ofay.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: Crack. He bled like a stuck hog.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Watcha gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>voice from the crowd</strong>: He’ll rap a little. He’s a
Muslim. And make a speech.</p>
<p><strong>another voice from crowd</strong>: Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing, unless somebody bothers Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: I demand to see Brother
Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m from Muslim Temple 7.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Never heard of you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Nobody here by that name.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: What’s your name, feller?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw
him brought in. He was not brought out.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: You heard the Sergeant. Outside.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Take a look out that window. I intend to
see Brother Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: Who the hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brothers of Brother Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: Eddie, let’s see that blotter.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Yeah. We got a Muslim. The relief must of
put it down.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: But you can’t see him. You ain’t his
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No lawyer, no see.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Until I’m satisfied Brother Johnson is
receiving proper medical attention, no one will move.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Only a pig could do a thing like that.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes</strong>: Watch your tongue, boy.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t you call me boy, you pig. Letting a
man bleed like that.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: All right, break it up. You got what you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>captain green</strong>: All right, that’s enough. I want
these people moved out of here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They’re all disciplined men. They’re doing
nothing except waiting.</p>
<p><strong>captain green</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s your headache, Captain. And if he
dies, I pity you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’ll live. He’s getting the best care we
can give.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I had to put a plate in his head.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You bastards.</p>
<p><strong>captain green</strong>: All right, okay. Now disperse this
mob.</p>
<p><strong>captain green</strong>: That’s too much power for one man to
have.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Brother Minister, we need to strike
back.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Put fear into those devils.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I want to also, but until we are instructed
by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: I’m tired of praying.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s enough, Brother Earl.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sit down, son.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what
you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain’t never seen a Negro stand up to
the police like that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you know what it means to be a true
Muslim?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: Not exactly, but I want to be one, like
you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I admire your enthusiasm but you should
never join any organization without first checking it out
thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: Mr. X, I won’t make you out a liar.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to
see you now.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial
work teaches us humility.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let me do it then.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: No, each of us must relearn that work is the
only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely,
never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Allah Akbar.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Tonight I shall introduce you as my National
Representative. It will be a difficult task. Your assignment is to build
temples all over this nation. More work than you have ever done in your
life and you will be in the public eye. My son, beware of those cameras,
they are just as bad as a narcotic.</p>
<p><strong>voice of malcolm x</strong>: This sweet, gentle man gave me
the truth from his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense of the
Latin root of the word. Adorare, to worship and to fear. He was the
first man I ever feared – not fear such as the one has of a gun but the
fear one has of the power of the sun, I pledged myself to him, even if
it cost me my life.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Sister Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: At a gas station. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I think so. Can you catch a plane?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes. Did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It won’t be easy.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just hold me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It will be rough.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hush your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ll be away a lot.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re with me even when you’re away.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The simplest thing in the world: I want to
have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>bembry’s voice</strong>: We’re waiting on you folks. You
trying to starve us?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I must emphasize at the outstart, that the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I’m not here this
afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk,
not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as
a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an
American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So
I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What kind of black people does the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless… the
black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are
dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to
live… the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of
white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist
in our community… the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of
bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that
patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy
army… the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom
leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people
and to KEEP US</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If the black man cannot go back to his own
people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the
United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live
separately.</p>
<p><strong>betty’s voice</strong>: Attallah is fine. Our firstborn is an
angel and a beauty. And misses you as I do. But the news that you’ve
dedicated four new temples is almost as good as having you with us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm/his voice</strong>: The white people who are guilty
of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to
uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people
in this country. And the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the
black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by
accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic simply
because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and
trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community. The
black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the
hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant Negro
preachers, we have thought that it was God-like to turn the other cheek
to the brute that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they use to put on a
white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they’ve taken
off sheets and put on police uniforms, they’ve traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs. And just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep
the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the Ku Klux Klan
by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as
spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black people
that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has God
given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights
that you can think of when it comes to defending himself.</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Mr. X, before we start our discussion
tonight – The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers – would you mind explaining
for us the meaning of your name, which is the letter X.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time,
the slavemasters named most of the so-called Negroes in America after
themselves. Mr. Elijah Muhammad teaches us once you come into the
knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name with an X. Since we’ve
been disconnected, cut off from our Eastern culture for so long that we
don’t know the names we originally had, we will use X until we get back
to the East.</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Thank you. Now Dr. Payson.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payson</strong>: Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to
go, so he exaggerates. He’s a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro
in the country. Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payson</strong>: Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black
supremacy? Why do you teach hate?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: For the white man to ask the black man if
he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf
asking the sheep, “Do you hate me!” The white man is in no moral
position to accuse anyone of hate.</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there
has been progress.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ll talk about “progress” in a minute, but
let me finish with my brother.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payson</strong>: You put it very well.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You left one phrase out. Another educated
Kneegrew said to me and I quote: “Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the
dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture.” Would you agree?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payson</strong>: Entirely.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Well, I have this to say. Do you know what
a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called – by the white man?
I’ll tell you. He’s called a nigger.</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has
something to–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t you want to hear about the Field
Nigger?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payson</strong>: Let him finish.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you. Now the Negro in the field
caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a
shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught
fire, he’d pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he’d pray that he’d
die. And if you said to him, “Let’s go, let’s separate”, he’d yell,
“Yeah, man, any place is better than this.” You’ve got a lot of Field
Negroes in America today. I’m one.</p>
<p><strong>brother benjamin</strong>: Tell it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –there’s another one. The majority of black
Americans today are Field Negroes. They don’t talk about OUR progress,
about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won’t even
let you near the plant.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your
true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting
too much press. The brothers think he thinks <em>he</em> is the Nation
of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who
made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Go and tell the brothers what Brother
Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the
Nation.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: Great benefit for himself.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brother Man, put that bottle down, take
that poison away from your lips. That’s what the devil wants you to do,
stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s time you received your X. But first
you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the
dotted “i’s,” crossed “t’s,” everything. And you must go on a fast, just
water and juices, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin</strong>: I’ll have it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be
exact.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: When you live in a poor neighborhood,
you’re living in an area where you have poor schools.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You are now Benjamin 2X.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: All praises are due to Allah. Thank
you, Brother Minister.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Come, sit with us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin
2X.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Allah Akbar.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You will be good.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: Brother Minister, can I have something
to eat?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let’s get this man some food.</p>
<p><strong>coed</strong>: Mr. X, I’ve read some of your speeches and I
honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it. I have a good
heart. I’m a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white
people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to
help the cause?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …My high school was the black ghetto of
Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, and I took my masters in
prison. If you look out the window–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: –you can see my burglary hangout. I
lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God’s
side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles. When
Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop
fornicating and committing adultery. When we get off the welfare, then
we’ll be MEN. Earn what you need for your family, then your family
respects you. They’ll be proud to say “That’s my father.” She’s proud to
say “That’s my husband…” Father means you’re taking care of those
children. Just ’cause you made them that don’t mean you’re a father.
Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can’t take care of them. Anyone can
go and get a woman but anybody can’t take care of a woman. This is the
type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can
build the moral fiber of our people.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can see the gentlemen of the press, also
the FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight ’cuz if I said, “Mary had
a little lamb,” they’d write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We have built temples in Boston, in
Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington – 100 temples in fifty
states. From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm/his voice</strong>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that God is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth
based on brotherhood and</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are
you?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Please make way, please–</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sure, man.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Are you Elijah’s pimp?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: “His greatest greatness.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Say what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: If you don’t know, man, then I feel
sorriest for you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Okay, last hug.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Because you’re in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dear heart, because I know you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t want to bring my troubles home. You
know that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m not made of glass.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I just want to sit here and be still.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’ve never had a fight. Not a real one. But
we’re going to have one right now if you don’t talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Talk about what?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The talk is everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There’s always talk, always been talk, and
always will be talk. Don’t they say how I’m trying to take over the
Nation, how I’m getting rich off the Nation?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’ll get to that, too, but this isn’t just
talk any more.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There are always slanders, always lies.
You’re reading the devil’s lies. Can’t you see they’re trying to bring
us down, bring down the Messenger.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Both women, in their 20’s, charged they had
had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957…”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I was going to talk to Bembry about it
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Woman, have you lost your mind? What’s the
matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, what’s the matter with you? Wake up! Are
you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed
you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you
established. Ask him why your name hasn’t been in “Muhammad Speaks” in
over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the
country, but not a single sentence in your own.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not interested in personal publicity.
Our people know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you know what Bembry is doing? You’re so
blind, everyone can see this but you!!!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: A long time ago. You’ve repaid them many
times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new
furniture.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is that what this is about? Material
wealth?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down
jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don’t even own our own home.
What about our children? What about me? You don’t even own life
insurance.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The Nation will provide for you and the
children if anything happens to me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are
you blind?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you want me to do? Our people need
me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We need you too!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a
day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you
won’t do that for yourself do it for us.</p>
<p><strong>sister evelyn</strong>: Her name is Eva Marie, she’s 2 years
old. Brother Minister, I did nothing wrong. I did nothing to be put in
isolation. I believed in him. I believed in the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sister Evelyn, believe in Allah.</p>
<p><strong>sister lucille</strong>: This is Saudi, she’s 3 and you have
Lisha, she’s 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the
father of my 3 children.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: He told you that?</p>
<p><strong>sister lucille</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>sister lucille</strong>: Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I
want is support for my children. He should provide for his children.
That’s all I want.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Allah will provide.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: What are you talking about – “blackout”?
Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a
little – overpublicized. That’s all. Forget it. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: “I’m telling you God’s words, not to
hustle.”</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: You want a new car? You want a new house? Is
that it? It’s the money, right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We tell the world we’re moral leaders
because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
It’s hard to make a rooster stop crowing once the sun has risen. The sun
is up.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And what do I say of this so-called
national mourning! I say… the white man’s acts are condemned, not only
by our beliefs but by his own.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Both his Bible and the Holy Koran say: “As
you sow, so shall you reap.” Both say: “Sow the wind, reap the whirl
wind.”</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Alaikum Wa-Salaam.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Minister X! Don’t you have even a little
bit of remorse… saddened by President Kennedy’s assassination?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Assassination might be too good a word, and
might I add an Arabic word at that. This was a prime example of the
devil’s chickens coming home to roost. Being an old farm boy myself,
chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad. It always made me
glad.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Did you see the papers today?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes, sir, I did.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: That was a very bad statement. The country
loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I agree with you, sir. I submit 100
percent.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: C’mon girls, it’s bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Another one?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How long has this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: All day since you and Betty left. Brother
Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I
couldn’t do it. I love y’all.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What mission?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: To wire your car so it would explode when
you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths
about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas,
Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and
delivered to the Messenger’s doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What does Sidney say?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I’m with you, Brother Minister.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No. You’ll be marked for death.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Let me die then.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I won’t let myself come between you and
your father. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You’re my father.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And don’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Because 1964 threatens to be a very
explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be
very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN
RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to
clarify my own position in the struggle – especially in regards to
politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the
words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I
speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences
within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my
own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most
of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a
more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to
this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in
divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine
prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field,
but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I’m not out to
fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common
solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new
mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us
a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of
the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political
philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy
will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open
for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but
they can’t join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is
first some black unity.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I
am welcomed as the representative of our people.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: I wonder who he’s working for? If I
was a betting man, I’d say CIA. What’s your guess?</p>
<p><strong>betty’s voice</strong>: I arrived in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. I
have never witnessed such sincere…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: Today, with thousands of others, I
proclaimed God’s greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram
garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of
Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was
the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt
like a complete human being.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: You may be shocked by these words,
but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and
prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose
hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are
brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and
one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It
has happened again…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: In the past, I have permitted
myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and
these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did
not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed
to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no
longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be
careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I’m not a
racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all
honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom,
justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for
all people.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: My first concern, of course, is
with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than
any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm’s voice</strong>: I believe the true practice of
Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white
Americans.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad
you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: As I recall, I pointed out that while I was
in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that
existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the
religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those
people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do
America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive
some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as
human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all
other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my
friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #8</strong>: Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the
United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the
United States for its treatment of the American Negroes?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Are you prepared to work with some of
the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Certainly, we will work with any groups,
organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it’s genuinely designed
to get results.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Does the new beard have any religious
significance?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, not particularly. But I do think that
you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the
shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to
throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they’ll begin
to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: One of your more controversial remarks
was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime
back. Do you still favor that for self-defense?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t see why that should be
controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of
the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and
they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect
them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them
get some rifles and protect themselves.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: What about the guns, Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Has the white man changed since I went
away? Have you put up your guns? The day you stop being violent against
my people will be the day I tell folks to put away their guns.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Then you’re still an extremist?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin thomas</strong>: Git your hand out of my pocket!</p>
<p>****: He doesn’t see anyone and closes the curtain. The phone
rings.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re one dead nigger.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re days on this earth are numbered,
brother.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You have to sleep for three.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m sorry. I haven’t been the best husband
or father.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Families shouldn’t be separated. I’ll never
make another long trip without you and the kids. We’ll all be
together.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dear heart, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We had the best organization that black
people ever had and niggers ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Walk out the back, dear. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of. It might
be a little cold. Hang on. We’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Everybody out. OUT! OUT! Get the kids.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Call the Fire Department.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And the fire hit the window and it woke up
my second oldest baby, but the fire burned on the outside of the house.
It could have fallen on six-, four-, or two-year-old girls. And I’m
going to tell you, if it had done it, I’d’ve taken my rifle and gone
after anybody in sight.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Are the Muslims behind this?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It was bombed by the Black Muslim movement
upon the orders of Elijah Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>second reporter</strong>: Do you know what Muslim
headquarters is saying?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can imagine. I did it myself. For the
publicity.</p>
<p><strong>bembry</strong>: We feel this is a publicity stunt on the
part of Malcolm X. We hope this isn’t a case of “if he can’t keep the
house, we won’t get it either.”</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: We called your house, operator said
you had requested that your phone be turned off.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: Give us the command, Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t care about myself, my wife and four
children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with
this.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Let’s get out of this cold.</p>
<p><strong>assassins</strong>: Allah Akbar.</p>
<p><strong>coed</strong>: Mr. X. I have a good heart. I’m a good person
despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself who are
not prejudiced do to help the cause of the Negro?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let sincere white individuals find other
white people who feel as they do and teach non-violence to those whites
who think and act so racist.</p>
<p><strong>coed</strong>: I will, Mr. X, I will.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Let’s all pray without ceasing. May Allah
bless you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brother Earl.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Malcolm, where are you? We’ve been
calling all over the city.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m gonna try and get some work done
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Let some of us come down there.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, that won’t be necessary. I’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: I wish you’d listen to us. What about
the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t want folks to be searched, it makes
people uncomfortable. If I can’t be safe among my own kind, where can I
be? Allah will protect me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That red nigger of yours is dead and so are
your bastard children.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us
alone. I’ll kill you. I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Betty it’s me. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us.
I’m going crazy, when is this going to stop?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t answer the phone. It’s all right.
It’s all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dear heart, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: At the Hilton. The girls asleep?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just put them to bed. Can we come to the
meeting tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t think that’s such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>kinley</strong>: Brothers, the time is fast approaching, it’s
the hour of the knife.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Say thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gamilah</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>brother benjamin 2x</strong>: No sign of the minister
yet.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: He’ll be here like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Son, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Ma’am, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Good. We need you. I recognize you, don’t
pay them folks no never mind, you keep on doing what you doing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: May Allah bless you.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I’ll pray for you too, son. Jesus will
protect you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is the program ready?</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: No, Brother Minister.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Why not? You’ve had ample time, you and the
sister.</p>
<p><strong>sister robin</strong>: I apologize Brother Minister, we’ll
have it next week.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Folks are sitting out there <em>today</em>,
not next week, expecting to hear our program.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: Next week, Brother Minister.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Has the Reverend called? Is he going to
show?</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Reverend Chickenwing called last night
and said he wouldn’t be able to attend.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: So now we have no opening speaker? Why
wasn’t I informed last night?</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: I called Sister Betty, she didn’t tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Since when do you start telling Sister
Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell
me, not her, not anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: I assumed…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What did I tell you about assuming?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Benjamin, you better go out there and
explain why the program isn’t ready today.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sister, please go with the brother.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Brother Minister, what is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: The way I feel, I ought not to go out there
today. In fact, I’m going to ease some of this tension by telling the
black man not to fight himself – that’s all a part of the white man’s
big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other.
I’m not fighting anyone, that’s not what we’re here for.</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Let’s cancel.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is my family here yet?</p>
<p><strong>brother earl</strong>: Down front as always.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’ll have to forgive me for raising my
voice to you.</p>
<p><strong>sister robin</strong>: Brother Minister, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I wonder if anybody understands.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Make it plain.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin 2x</strong>: And now, without further remarks, I
present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for
you–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Brothers and Sisters, Wa-Salaam
Alaikum.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Alaikum Wa-Salaam.</p>
<p><strong>benjamin thomas</strong>: Git your hand out of my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hold it, brothers. Don’t get excited. Let’s
cool it–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Somebody call an ambulance. Somebody call an
ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>betty’s voice</strong>: They killed him. They killed him.</p>
<p><strong>hospital spokesperson</strong>: The person you know as
Malcolm is no more.</p>
<p><strong>ossie davis’s voice</strong>: Here at this final hour, in
this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its
brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from us forever.</p>
<p><strong>ossie davis’s voice</strong>: For Harlem is where he worked,
and where he struggled and fought. His home of homes, where his heart
was and where his people are. And it is therefore most fitting that we
meet once again in Harlem to share these last moments with him. For
Harlem has ever been gracious to those who loved her, have fought for
her and defended her honor even to death. It is not in the memory of man
that this beleaguered, unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has
found a braver, more gallant young champion than this Afro-American who
lies before us unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem finds to
honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain and we will
smile and we will answer and say unto them:</p>
<p><strong>1st student</strong>: I’m Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>2nd student</strong>: I’m Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>3rd student</strong>: I’m Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>4th female student</strong>: I’m Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>1st student</strong>: I’m Malcolm X.</p>

<p><strong>mandela</strong>: As Brother Malcolm said, “We declare our
right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as
a human being, in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we
intend to bring into existence by any means necessary.”</p>
