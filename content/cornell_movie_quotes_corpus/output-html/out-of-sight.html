<p><strong>teller/loretta</strong>: How can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Loretta, you see that guy talking to your
manager, has his case open?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That’s Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
managers. Our manager is Mr. Schoen, but he’s not in today.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: But you see the guy with the attache
case?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s my partner. He has a gun in there. And
if you don’t do exactly what I tell you, or you give me any kind of a
problem, I’ll look over at my partner and he’ll shoot your Mr. Guindon
between the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Now take one of those big envelopes and put
as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it. Nothing
with bank straps or rubber bands. I don’t want any dye packs. I don’t
want any bait money. Start with the second drawer and then the one over
there, under the computer. Come on, Loretta, the key’s right there next
to you. No bills off the bottom of the drawer. First time being robbed?
You’re doing great. Just smile, Loretta, so you won’t look like you’re
being held up. That’s the way, you’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Here, give me the twenties. I’ll put ’em in
my pocket. Okay, I haven’t had to give my partner a sign; that’s good.
Now, he’s gonna wait thirty seconds till after I’m out the door, make
sure you haven’t set off the alarm. If you have, he’s gonna shoot
Mr. Guindon between the eyes. Okay? I think that’ll do it. Thank you,
Loretta, and have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She’s cute, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Uh, yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I think you flooded it.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Get out’ve the car, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Wanna hear a funny story?</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Shut up and get out’ve the car.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: You want something, Foley?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Some people are going out of here. What if I
told you where and when?</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me
run off work details.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: Okay. How many going out?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I hear six.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Looks like tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: You know who they are?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I do, but I won’t tell you just yet. Meet me
in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Today’s the day, huh?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You excited?</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, but I see you moved it up.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Why you think is today?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You were out running this morning, sticking
to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple
of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event.
Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for
endurance.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: You want, I tole you you can come. You all
right, Foley. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You told me I can come ‘cause I caught you
digging the fuckin’ tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
thought maybe you two were making out.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: So what, you finish ahead of schedule?</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: You see what they doing, those posts out
there? Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the
one that’s there. We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the
second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days. So we
going soon as it’s dark. You want – I mean it – you can still come.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I appreciate the offer. And it’s
tempting.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: But, man, it’s a long run to civilization. A
hundred miles to Miami? I’m too old to start acting crazy, try a stunt
like that. You make it out, send me a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hello? Yeah, I accept.</p>
<p><strong>foley’s voice</strong>: Hey, Adele, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice? Next
time, leave the engine running.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s funny, Adele. How many more times you
gonna gimme that one?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Till it’s not funny any more. What do you
want, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You know that Super Bowl party? They changed
the date. It’s on tonight, eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Didn’t you tell me one-time calls aren’t
monitored?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I said not as a rule.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: So why don’t you come right out and tell me
what you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the
free world.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What’s free about it? I’m looking for
work.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What happened to Mandrake the Magician?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired me and
hired another girl, a redhead. I’m working on a new business card, pass
out to the cafes. How’s this sound–</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that
party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few
hours from now. So you’ll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might
be doing…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: And the one driving the other car?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Well, seeing as you have so much luck with
cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he
says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Glenn Michaels.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yeah, that’s him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you
guys are real cool.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn
wearing his sunglasses I’ll step on ’em. I might not even take ’em off
first.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You fit another Chanel suit in here?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Something better. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s a –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: –Sig-Sauer .38. I love it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Happy birthday, kid. You want another
Coke?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Can’t. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I’m
meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Which one is that? The ATF guy?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He was. Ray’s with the F.B.I. now, he
switched over.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He’s still married though, huh?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Technically. They’re separated.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh, he’s moved out?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s about to.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Then they’re not separated, are they?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Can we change the subject?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What’re you doing at Glades?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.
Some con doing mandatory life doesn’t like macaroni and cheese. He files
suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil
rights.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You know you can always step in, work with
me full-time as one of my investigators.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You used to like it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’d meet doctors, lawyers – nothing
wrong with them necessarily if they’re divorced. Why settle for some
cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That’s the way
those hotshots are, all of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I really gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We don’t get to talk much any more.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How ’bout I come next Sunday and watch the
Super Bowl with you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thanks for the gun, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Ref don’t call it pretty soon, Snoopy’s gonna
send this guy out in a body bag.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Anyone ever tell you why they call him
Snoopy?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: He was Maurice “Mad Dog” Miller back when he
was pro. Now you pet him, he goes down.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Guy’s braggin’ he won a thrown fight. Fuckin’
pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It’s Richard Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn’t
recognize him without his rug.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Dick the Ripper they called him, on account
of all the people he ripped off.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s he doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: He got three years and fined fifty million
dollars and wrote ’em a fucking check. Like that, fifty mil, signed his
name. Whoa– little help here!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Who you talkin’ to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I
can’t tell, you got those shades on.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You guys– come on– this is too heavy!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I guess the bright glare out here made it
hard to see the numbers on the weights.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I’ll take the shades off. Just get this
fuckin’ thing off me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How do you know he wrote a check?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: He told me. He works the laundry with me. The
guy loves to talk.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney. I hear he rolled
over on all the snitches he was doing business with and got ’em all
brought up.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Hey, anybody that can write a check for fifty
mil, he says anything I’m all fucking ears. Like the other day, he tells
me how he’s got all this money in foreign banks, plus around five mil in
uncut diamonds at his house. He said, quote, “Where I can put my hands
on it anytime.”</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cool. Where’s the guy live?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Detroit. Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look
like plain old rocks.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: So. What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: My point is, that’s probably what you’re
gonna end up with.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You think he’s lying?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Use your head. The guys got five million
lying around his house, you really think he’s gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I guess the Snoop doesn’t like to lose, even
if it’s on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You don’t wanna be standing there, the hacks
start asking questions you don’t wanna answer.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Oh, uh, right, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Here, lemme help you with those, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I didn’t ask for your help, so don’t expect a
tip.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s okay, ma’am. I’ll just take your
car.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They’re right underneath you, Pup. They dug a
tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: I don’t hear ’em. Where’s the tunnel come
out?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Second fence post from the tower out there.
Go on, take a look.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: I don’t see nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You will directly. Keep watching.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hi. Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet. He’s
not? Could you tell him that… never mind. I’ll call back.</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: There some car headlights out there… Jesus
Christ…</p>
<p><strong>pup</strong>: Man outside the fence! By tower six! This is
Officer Pupko… I’m looking at him, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Get your hands in the air!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’s okay, honey, we’re good guys.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I bet that’s all the hacks they send out.
Otherwise nobody’s left to mind the store.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Why don’t we talk about it later?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why you’re just a girl. What do you do for a
living you pack a shotgun?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m a federal marshal and you’re under
arrest, both of you guys.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I bet I smell, don’t I? Listen, you hop in
the trunk and we’ll get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You comfy?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If I could have a little more room.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: There isn’t any. All this shit you got in
here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains… what’s this
can?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: For your breath. You could use it. Squirt
some in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You devil, it’s mace, huh? What’ve you got
here, a billy? Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Where’s your gun, your pistol?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: In my bag, in the car.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know you don’t have a chance of making
it. Guards are out here already, they’ll stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They’re off in the cane by now chasing
Cubans. I timed it to slip between the cracks, you might say.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Boy, it stunk in there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I believe it. You’ve ruined a nine-
hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge,
too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a
federal marshall?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The idea of going after guys like you
appealed to me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even though
I’ve been celibate lately, I’m not gonna force myself on you. I’ve never
done that in my life.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You wouldn’t have time anyway. We come to a
roadblock, they’ll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs
to.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: If they get set up in time, which I doubt.
And even if they do they’ll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas,
not a big black guy driving a Ford.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like
this.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Who, Buddy? Yeah. He’s a good guy. Back when
we jailed together, he’d call his sister every week without fail. She’s
a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy
calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he
happened to rob.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Buddy. That’s his given name?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: One I gave him, yeah. Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So, what’s your name? It’ll be in the paper
tomorrow anyway.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Jack Foley. You’ve probably heard of me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why, are you famous?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Time I was convicted in California? FBI told
me I’d robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How many was that?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Tell you the truth, I don’t know. I started
when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.
They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to
get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in
Angola.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I thought so, too.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It was me, I woulda left ol’ Gus on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I believe you would have. Another fall, I did
seven years at Lompoc. And I don’t mean the place next door where some
of Nixon’s people went.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know the difference. You were in Lompoc
USP, the federal penitentiary. I’ve delivered people there. So basically
you’ve spent half your life in prison.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a
full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t have to. I don’t rob banks.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You don’t seem all that scared.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Of course I am.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You don’t act like it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What do you want me to do? Scream? I don’t
think it would help much. I’m just gonna sit back, take it easy, and
wait for you to screw up.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You were married? All those falls, I’m
surprised you had time.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It was just a year, give or take a few days.
I mean, it’s not like we didn’t get along or anything. We had fun, we
just didn’t have that… that thing, you know? That spark, you know what I
mean? You gotta have that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We still talk, though.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know, this isn’t gonna end well, these
things never do.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a
dog, it’ll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde
Barrow.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde? Hm. You
ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat? You could tell he had
that don’t-give-a-shit air about him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t recall his hat, but I’ve seen
pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers. Did you know he
didn’t have his shoes on?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet
holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was
eating a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re full of interesting facts, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,
Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That part in the movie where they get shot?
Warren Beatty and… I can’t think of her name.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Faye Dunaway.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, I liked her in that movie about</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Network. Yeah, she was good.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And the guy saying he wasn’t gonna take any
more shit from anybody…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Peter Finch.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where Warren
Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot? I remember thinking at the time it
wouldn’t be a bad way to go, if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Bleeding on a country road.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It wasn’t pretty after, no, but if you were
in that car – eating a sandwich – you wouldn’t have known what hit
you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re sure easy to talk to. I wonder – say
we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in
a bar and I came up to you – I wonder what would happen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I mean if you didn’t know who I was.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’d probably tell me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m just saying I think if we met under
different circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You have to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked,
Three Days of the Condor.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: With Robert Redford, when he was young.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I never thought it made sense, though, the
way they got together so quick.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I mean, romantically.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Uh-huh. Well, but if –</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You still alive in there?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Where in the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s the turnpike up there. Glenn’s waiting
with the other car.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Okay, honey, come on out of there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Get your hands up and turn around. Now.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We may as well leave her, we’re leaving the
car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what’s the difference
where?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She’s coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
there?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Get the shotgun. And her purse. I’d like to
know who she is.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I already looked. Her name is Karen Sisco.
Like the Cisco Kid only spelled different, S-i-s-c-o.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Karen? Be a good girl now, you hear? Now, I’m
gonna open the–</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re putting holes in your car!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We’re not leaving you. I’m gonna open the
trunk enough for you to throw the gun out. Okay? You shoot – Buddy’s got
your shotgun, says he’ll shoot back if you do and I can’t stop him. So
it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s me, Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Hey, Jack, good to see you, man. The fuck’re
you guys shooting at?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Do we need him?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: The green-and-whites saw us. One of ’em
starts thinking, what’s that car doing there? Ties it to the break and
turns around…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody
else.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Studs. Man, I haven’t heard that since
Lompoc. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oh, nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You coming out?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You win, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Have your clothes cleaned and send me the
bill.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll send it to you at Glades.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Jesus, what’d you crawl through, a sewer?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Take your sunglasses off.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I see better with them on.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You don’t take ’em off, I’m gonna throw ’em
off the overpass while they’re still on your head.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Wait in the car.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You’re in civilization now, man, ease up.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’d like you to go wait in the car. How’s
that? Take her with you and put her in back.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: In the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: The backseat.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Come on. I have to do what I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Wait a minute. Let me have your raincoat.
Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I brought ’em, they’re back at Glades in the
Cadillac. You wanted to take her car.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You can blame me if you want. I don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Here you are, sir.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why you brought Glenn into this, I’ll never
know.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How ’bout the score was his idea to begin
with?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin’ guy’s got a
vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’re pulling at it. Here…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know why, but every time he opens his
mouth I want to punch him out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He ain’t the problem, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You wanna pull your head outta your ass and
tell me why we’re bringing her with us?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: …if he thinks he can talk to me like this.
Shit, I don’t even know what I need them for.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I got a big score lined up up north. They
wouldn’t even know about it, it wasn’t for me. I could do it right now
myself, except it’s so fucking cold up there in January–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Glenn?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t remember me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: It couldn’t have been out at Glades, if
that’s what you’re thinking. I was never out there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, that’s not what I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: But you’re sure we’ve met, huh?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach
county jail to the federal courthouse, twice. You’re Glenn Michaels. I
never forget anyone I’ve cuffed and shackled.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Let’s think for a minute, Glenn, see if we
can work this out…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Do we have a gun in the car?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I remember you now. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Foley’s not going to make it. And if he goes
down, Glenn, you go with him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look, I can understand if you and Foley are
close.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: We’re not. I’m helping him, yeah–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Wait. Have you helped him, Glenn? At this
point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
So you still have a choice. You can help him and risk going down again,
get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not
some hard-on. Or, if you want to play it another way…</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Like how?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You want to take her to my place and get
cleaned up? You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and
she goes, “Oh, I had you all wrong”?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I want to talk to her again, that’s all. See
what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’re too late, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He wants to get out of here and I don’t blame
him.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Dick. My man.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I got your fishies for you.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there’s
gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Year ago, I come in here on credit card
fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
day, my Dunn &amp; Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I think it’s Dunn &amp; Bradstreet. But
then, I could be wrong…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Whoever. The point is, prices are goin’ up,
too. Better get your little black book out, Richard. We got some
business to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let’s start with the fish. They was two
grand, but now they’s three.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That Bausch &amp; Lomb Saline shit you
asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Well, I need that…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: …and that extra pillow’s gonna be an even
three c’s.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Sign says “Shut the fuck up.” Or can’t you
guys read?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: There a problem, Foley?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest
fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks
for a pillow?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Sounds high, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Must be a real soft pillow.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Faux goose down.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Still…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How much for your company at chow?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Company, shit. I watch the man’s back.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I bet. How much?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Another C.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re smart, Ripley, you’ll tell this guy to
fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Really? Well, I uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: First of all, if he kills you, he’s not gonna
get any more money out of you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Man doesn’t have to get killed. He could
accidentally fall on something sharp, like a shiv. Or my dick.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You stick anything in this guy, Snoop, they
transfer his ass outta here faster’n you can throw a fight, and you
still end up with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This doesn’t concern you, Foley. Why don’t
you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>himey</strong>: You heard the man. Go on outta here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Himey here’s a pro-toh-jay of mine. He’s
ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Thirty-two outta what, twenty?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh, you know, reading’s funnamental an’
shit, we just excited.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Clear outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish
thing?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yeah. Sure. It’s all settled.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: That’s how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Stick and jab, fool. Stick and jab.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Hey! Watch that shit!</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Tuffy. C’mere, boy…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You gonna answer the phone?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: What for? It’s not for me.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Bad dog.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
little Tuffy?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: I’m trainin’ Tuffy, so he can be on a Kal
Kan commercial, make us some extra money.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That’s the dumbest thing I heard in my
life. Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn’t pay for shit. You gonna get a gig,
it’s gotta be for one of the big three: Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle
shit for the fat dogs. Now answer the fuckin phone.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Hello? For you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This is me.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Snoopy. Glenn Michaels.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Studs. Hey, son, you must be one a them
psychic friends. I was just thinkin’ about you.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Listen, Snoopy, I’m on my way up to Detroit
and need a place to crash.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You crazy, come up here? It’s fuckin one
degree outside.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I wanna talk to you about a job.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I can’t really go into it right now. I’ll
just tell you it’s someone big.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Someone? Gimme a hint.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: It’s a guy you know.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Gimme another hint.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: It’s Richard Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You there?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Oh, I’m here, all right. I’m very here.
Question is, why aren’t you here?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m just saying she wasn’t scared.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole
time, waiting to make her move.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re just jealous it was me in the trunk
with her and not you.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: First thing I’m gonna do is get all this mud
off me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’ve been dreaming about a hot bath for the
last six months. Soak the prison off me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There’s some lilac oil, you want some, a
vanilla candle under the sink.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There’s something about a nice hot bath,
transforms a person. It’s not just about opening up your pores, know
what I mean? There’s just something about the heat and the wet that’s
calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can’t
articulate.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I know exactly what you mean. It’s just a
feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There’s a store around the corner, I’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>marshall sisco</strong>: Karen…?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You were talking in your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: “Hey, yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Daniel Burdon, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Marshall Sisco. Karen’s dad.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You mind please waiting outside. We have
some business to do here.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I need to go to the john anyway.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: That’s nice of you to offer, Karen, but I
got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let’s talk about how you
got the bump on your head.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Isn’t that my report you’re holding onto?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel – where was this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Coming to the Okeechobee exit…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Take the next exit.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: What am I supposed to do now?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Glenn, take the exit.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: No way, man, no fuckin’ way am I gonna turn
myself in.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: The fuck are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The next thing I knew, the paramedics were
taking me out the car.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: There’s a couple of points I keep wondering
about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is it? And
this fella Jack Foley. I swear the man must’ve robbed two hundred banks
in his time.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Really? Huh. He told me he didn’t remember
how many he robbed.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You talked to him?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: In the trunk, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: What’d you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh… different things, prison, movies.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: This fella holds you hostage, you talk about
movies?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It was an unusual experience.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Foley made me think of that fella Carl
Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was
doing banks. You recall that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn’t know
he robbed banks.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he
did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And what happened to Carl?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: The time came, you shot him. But you didn’t
shoot Foley or the guy with him. They’re unarmed, you had a shotgun and
you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your
hand. You say in the report you couldn’t turn around, he had you pinned
down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn’t cap the two guys
then?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is that what you would’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You say in the report Glenn didn’t have a
gun, but you let him get away, too.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Daniel, what do you work on most of the time,
fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Karen, I’ve been with the Bureau fifteen
years, on all kinds of investigations.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Have you ever shot a man? How many times have
you been primary through the door?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: I have to qualify, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You have to know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: We’ll talk another time, Karen. All right?
I’d like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn’t
need you any more.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’ll have to ask him.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Sounds to me like he liked having you
around. I’ll see you, Karen. Mr. Sisco.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Agent Burdon.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The white man’s Burdon. That’s what
everybody calls him in Miami. The Metro-Dade guys. He’s got a knack for
pissing people off.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Tell you what, you’re a good girl, you
might get another one for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll get it back when I get Foley.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh– Are you delivering the oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Uh, no, ma’am. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You win, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You made the front page.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They pass this picture around you can go
anywhere you want, nobody’ll know you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I wasn’t feeling my best that day. I’d just
drawn thirty to life.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Maybe this’ll make you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Paper says there’s ten grand each on you,
Chino and Lulu.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Just that she got away.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, but what happened after she drove off
with Glenn?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’ll have to ask Glenn. And most likely,
he’s on his way to Detroit, where we should be.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You realize what you’re doing? Worrying about
a person that works in law enforcement. You want to sit down and have
cocktails with a girl that tried to shoot you. You hear what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It’s the
only picture she carries.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Am I going to Detroit by myself?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better
chance there is either Glenn’s gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
gonna get busted, or both.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We’ll leave first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Is this Foley?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He doesn’t even look like that.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, he looks a lot…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hi, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You look great. Your dad taking good care of
you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He took the week off so we’d have time
together. So far he’s worked on his boat every day. Dad? Ray
Nicolet.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ve heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ray’s with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on
the prison break.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I see that.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: In case no one knows what he does. Tell
me, Ray, you ever wear one says, “Undercover”?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. Course not.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Great. We got one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Was it Foley?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Off a tip?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, someone spotted two of ’em in this hobo
camp out by the airport, called the number–</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I knew it, soon as I saw they were
offering a reward.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Was it Foley?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Foley? Oh. No, it was one of the Cubans.
Linares.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the
whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway. We put him down, but
somehow Chirino got away.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Did you pay the guy the reward?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, as soon as we got back.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Foley hadn’t been there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This place was strictly Cuban. If Foley had a
ride he must have his own agenda. He seems to be the only one knows what
he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For
you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You know who this is?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I just wanted to see if you’re okay, make
sure Glenn didn’t hurt you or, you know, anything.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Something I’ve been wondering, Ray…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It says in the headline, “I slept with a
murderer, says shaken Miami woman.” She lives in Little Havana, her
husband’s out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her
door…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How’d you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Who was it answered the phone?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m just worried maybe I’m not old enough for
you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s my dad.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Really. He has a cop’s face.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How do you know? Wait– you have my
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And your gun.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Think I could have them back?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Let’s see. You could come on by my dad’s
place, drop ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Sure. I’ll just leave ’em with the S.W.A.T.
guy answers the door.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s a guy here on the task force right
now. Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You won’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Because you’re having too much fun.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: …She fixes him pork chops and rice, the
next thing you know they’re making love on the sofa. She says he was
very gentle.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I spoke to her. The guy told her he missed his
little girl and she felt sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s how you score now?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My dad’s retired. He was a Private
Investigator. Forty years. I used to work for him.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I can just picture that, a cute girl like you
following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Something I’ve been wondering, what ever
happened to your Uncle Cully?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why? You think he might tell you where I
am?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Unless you wanna tell me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: He’s dead. He did twenty-seven years before
he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think
trying to make up for all the good times he’d missed. That’s not gonna
be me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: One last score, that the idea? Move to some
island.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m partial to mountains myself. But if you
like islands, we’ll make it an island.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Whatta you mean we’ll make it an island?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I just thought maybe you and me could–</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Who you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is that Buddy?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You better come see this.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The woman also said he stole her husband’s gun,
a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: So the woman’s married. She goes to bed
with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then
tells the world about it. But you don’t reveal her name, you protect
her. It sounds like you’re saying it’s okay as long as her husband
doesn’t find out about it. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying
what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Chino’s gonna wanna talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He’s running for his life, he doesn’t give a
shit about you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: He’s gotta know by now that I gave him up
back at Glades. He does, he’s gonna try to find me. Maybe go see Adele,
see what she knows.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He knows where she lives?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We were talking one time, drinking rum. I
may’ve mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got
interested. He’s like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He
wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So call her up. Tell her don’t talk to any
Cubans.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Her phone’s probably tapped.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And you know they’re gonna have some people
watching the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Remember, pay attention to how she talks
about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she’ll tell you things she wouldn’t
tell Burdon. Tell her you think he’s a nice guy. No, first tell her
about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see
how she takes it. If she’s in on it, what does she get for all the
aggravation; cops breathing on her? I bet nothing. So she still likes
him enough to stick her neck out. You think that’s possible? What kind
of guy is he?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s pretty laid back, confident.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He remind you of that guy, Tillman?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: But you know he’s dirty and you still
wanna see him again.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I want to bust his ass, put him in
shackles.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Maybe. But you’re also curious about the
man. Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about
him. You were concerned, but you didn’t want to show it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My married boyfriend - setting him up with
that news story so you could talk about infidelity. I couldn’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You like the wild ones, don’t you?
Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I’ve always said there’s a
thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys
that love to pack.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Foley kidnapped me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI
to the turnpike. It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Go talk to the ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hi, this is Adele speaking.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Oh, is this Adele?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Uh– sorry. Wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Nice disguise.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m a tourist.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You at least bring the gun?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: In here with my suntan lotion and beach
towel. That’s her place.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There. You see the guy sitting on the porch?
The old ladies and one guy? You know they’ll have a couple more in a car
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Okay, you saw her. That’s all you get.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I guess Adele’s in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Sure looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Let’s go to Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Now you’re talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You were both in the trunk? Together?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with
Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The FBI didn’t tell you I was with them?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: They didn’t tell me anything, they asked
questions.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But you know what I’m talking about, don’t
you? About Glenn, don’t you, and the second car?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I know a Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’m getting ready to go out. You can come in
if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Those are cute shoes. The kind of jobs I get,
I have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: When you were in the trunk with Jack…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He didn’t hurt you or anything, did he?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he
was kind of talkative.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He gets that way when he’s nervous
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You didn’t visit him in prison.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He didn’t want me to.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I don’t know. He was different after he was
sentenced, looking at thirty years. Said it depressed him every time the
younger cons called him an old timer.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But you spoke to him on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He’d call every once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He called the day he escaped.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He did? I don’t remember. Did he say about
me? In the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He said he wished the two of you could start
over, live a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Huh. Problem is, Jack’s idea of a normal life
is robbing banks. It’s all he’s ever done.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Did you know that when you married him?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He said he was a card player. I could live
with that. I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car
that caught fire – if you can imagine something like that happening,
comes out of the bank and the car’s on fire. I did go see him in jail to
tell him I was filing for divorce. He said, “Okay.” Jack’s so easy
going. He was fun, but never what you’d call a real husband.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’ll say one thing for Jack, he was never
ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or
off, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Really. Hm.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Adele, sooner or later, he’s gonna get
caught. I’d like to get him before he does something else, makes it
worse on himself.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Buddy’ll take care of him. Keep him out’ve
trouble. He’s Jack’s conscience. Always has been. He tell you how they
met?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in
Pasadena, couldn’t get his stolen car to start. Battery was dead. He
looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy says, I’ll take the thousand, but
we’re leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in. They musta
robbed fifty banks together.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Till they got busted.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: That wasn’t Jack’s fault. No, that was on
account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and
confess to a job before they’d done it instead of after. She called the
FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt
kinda bad about that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Any idea where I could find Buddy? Or
Glenn?</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Adele? You in there?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: I want to speak with you, please.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
He tole me your number and where you live. See, I’m looking for an
assistant and would like to speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Oh. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: You did work for Emil, right?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yeah, I was Emil’s box-jumper for almost four
years.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: You were his what, his box?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: His assistant.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You say you perform in the Miami area?</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Yes, around here. I was a mayishan in
Cuba before I come here. Manuel the Mayishan was my name.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Can you open the door?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’m not dressed.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Listen to me. I’m a good friend of
Jack Foley.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ask him his name.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Jose Chirino.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
Chino. I’m the same person.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Tell him to wait in the hall, you have to get
dressed. Say it loud.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Wait in the hall! I have to get dressed!</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don’t
bother you no more.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Listen, I’m the one help Jack escape
from prison. He tole me, I can’t find him to see you. So why don’t you
open this fucking door. Okay? So we can speak.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Go away, or I’ll call the police.</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Why you want to do that, to a
frien’?</p>
<p><strong>chino’s voice</strong>: Okay, you don’t want to help me, I’m
leaving. I’m going now. I see you maybe some time, okay? Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Go in the bedroom and –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Leave it where it is.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Wait. You not Adele?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m a federal marshal and you’re under
arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Oh. Then this must be Adele…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Put it down or I’ll shoot.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: You wouldn’t shoot me, would you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What do you want to bet?</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: I could walk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If you move, if you look at her again, you’re
dead.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You can live or die, it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Oh, is that right? You going to shoot me?
Nice girl like you? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t, huh?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: On your knees.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Lie face down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Excuse me, Adele?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: You do the sawing of the box in half trick
with you inside?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chino</strong>: Tell me, how do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a
hold of you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Daniel. Listen –</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Where are you? I been trying to reach
you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m at Adele Delisi’s.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: What– we already talked to her. That’s a
dead end.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were
you trying to reach me?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the
same time Foley was there. We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel
in Hallandale. I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to
i.d. him as the other guy. If he does, you call me right away…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: All right, but…</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: But don’t you do anything. You just have a
seat, wait for me to get there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sure, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Now. What is it you wanted to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring
in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: What? Is that what you’re calling me
about?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will you let
me go after Foley?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you
can be on the task force.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s all I wanted to know.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Good. Now forget about the ex-wife and get
over to the Adams Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find
Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I been thinkin’, if I was Glenn, I was up
there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you
wouldn’t be thinking.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from
Lompoc?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Snoopy. Christ, I thought he’d be brain dead
by now.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He isn’t fighting no more. Glenn told me the
Snoop’s been managing some guys up there now, works out at the
Kronk.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You get the key?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They’re in 7D.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: I want two men outside, front and back.
Conway and Jessup go on up to seven, cover both ends of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You’re primary, you’re secondary, you’re
point man.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re gonna use a ram?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Yeah, why?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The manager’s door is metal.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know what I mean? They might all be. And
a ram on a metal door makes an awful lot of noise for what good it
does.</p>
<p><strong>fourth man</strong>: I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
oughta do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Fine. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Fuck it. Let’s take the stairs. Karen…</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby,
watch the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You can go wait out in the car, you want
to.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in
behind us, whatta you do?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Call and tell you.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: And you let them come up. You don’t try to
make the bust yourself. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Are you delivering the oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Is this your floor, mother?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Oh. Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>old gent</strong>: Like to play some gin?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Karen. They’re not up here. Keep your eyes
open.</p>
<p><strong>old gent</strong>: Going up?</p>
<p><strong>old gent</strong>: Shit, I wanted to go up.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let’s just hope there’s no one in the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She looked right at me. She didn’t yell or
get excited. She didn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They know where I live, I guess they know
what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She just sat there, looking right at me.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Karen. Report. You see anything? Karen? You
there? Karen…?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He waved to you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I couldn’t swear to it, but I’m pretty sure
he did.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You wave back?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I didn’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I imagine you would’ve though.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Buddy’s sister Regina Mary Bragg got two
calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon. She’s also
the one gave Burdon Buddy’s address.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So what I want to know is why Buddy still
calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He doesn’t seem to hold a grudge. What I
want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang
around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: None I’d like to share.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll call soon as I get in.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I don’t just manage fighters, or deal
product any more…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’ve diversified since the last time you
saw me. I’ve vertically integrated and now I’m into home invasions and
the occasional grand larceny.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: White Boy Bob’s my all-around man, my
bodyguard when I feel I need one, and my driver.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Watch the road, boy. I like this Town Car.
We can cruise the man’s neighbourhood without getting the police or
private security people on our ass.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around
a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
won’t think anything of it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It’s lilac, man, the color, and the style’s
made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros. I could be
one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball
players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley’s house up on the left. Yeah. The
brick wall. There’s his drive, right there.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You sure Foley and his pal aren’t coming up
here, do this themself?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: If they’re not busted now, they’re gonna be.
It’s wide open.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: So you still haven’t said, how you wanna do
it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I’ll show you, soon as I get one more guy
I’m gonna need, Moselle’s brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy
there.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You get everything?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Cool. Kenneth, this is the man I told you
about, Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: The one gonna help us rip off the rich
guy?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Help you…</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Wait a minute. I’m letting you in on this,
not all your friends.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You just ask me how we gonna do it. That’s
what I’m here for, tell you how. We the experts.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Thing I’m worried about is you.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yeah. If you can step up and actually do
it. Understand? ’Stead of just talking the talk.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Can I do what?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
dressin’ nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin’ on his
own.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: What– when?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Right now, son.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I don’t have to prove shit to you. The Ripley
job is my job. You’re either in or you’re not. You wanna pop some crack
dealer pissed you off, that’s your problem, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don’t
have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don’t like what I’m saying,
you can get out anywhere along here you want.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I think you’re forgetting, this is my car. I
drove it up here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this car,
man, it’s mine. You go get yourself another one. I say I’m in on Ripley?
I’m in, with or without your ass. I say I want you to come along on
another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let’s go see Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Must take balls, do what you do.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Tell me something. What’s it like, walk in a
bank with a gun, stick it up?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know. I never used a gun.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’d be surprised what all you can get, you
ask for it the right way.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’re the reason, Jack, I don’t keep all my
money in banks.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No? Where do you keep it, Dick? I’m talking
about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re the one with balls, Dick, say
something like that to someone like Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot
where you were for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yeah, but who’s gonna believe Glenn? I mean,
do you believe Glenn?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Plus, even it was true, he’d still have to
figure out where I keep ’em.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Doesn’t have to figure out shit. You told him
you keep ’em at your house.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s a big house.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you
in here?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I was just thinking that I could use a guy
like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. I’m talkin’
about when you’re outta here. I mean, you can’t rob banks for ever.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It’s a little late for me.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn’t make my first
million until I was forty- two. Forty-two. You really want to change,
it’s never too late.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know. I’m not exactly the
nine-to-five type.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Who is? But then you gotta look at a job as
more than just work. You gotta look at it as peace of mind. As security,
you know what I mean? I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your
pick.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: My ex-wife’s in Miami. It’s nice down
there.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let
whatever happens happen.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: The fish?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yeah, fish live in the present. They don’t
dwell on yesterday and they don’t worry about tomorrow. Even when a big
fish attacks a little fish, there’s no neurosis involved. No guilt
afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink’s couch. They just do it. They
accept.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I can’t say that I’ve paid that much
attention to ’em before.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The fish saved my life. Two years ago, I
found out I had high blood pressure. So my doctor, he tells me to go get
an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing
out.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And the guy sent you a bill for this?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It works. You should try it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: The next time I walk into a bank.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Think about my offer, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, Jack…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You see this one…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: “Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred
slaying.” Seems this woman’s live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face
with a twelve-gauge. Police found noodles in the woman’s hair and think
the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him. They’d
been together ten years.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Love is funny.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey–</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Was a time you see a gold Mercedes over in
the parking lot has a license plate on it say HITMAN? You know Tommy
Hearns is inside. Seeing the car would get our juices flowing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You already got your juices flowing, huh?
Pissed your pants back there at Eddie’s house, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: That was some shit, huh?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Why’d he have to do that to that girl?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to
that poor girl.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Just wait till we get inside Ripley’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: It’s all right with you, I’ll just hang in
the car.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: No. You gonna stay close to me from now on.
So you don’t disappear on me.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Was worse than you imagined, wasn’t it?
Baby, you with the bad boys now.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Whatta you think?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we
got us another partner.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Or two.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Stick and jab!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Studs, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Jesus Christ, what’re you guys doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Weren’t you expecting us?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: That broad you picked up – did you know she
was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: She knew me from some bullshit dope bust. She
drove me to court. Twice. You know what she said, we’re in the car on
the turnpike? “I never forget anybody I’ve cuffed and shackled.”</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah? She said that to you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What happened to your shades? Someone finally
step on ’em?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Whose blood you got all over you?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: These guys, man, they’re crazy. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s he do now, tell fortunes?</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: We have a problem here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Jack Foley, famous bank robber.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: It seems to me I been reading about you in
the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Low class of people there, Snoop.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: You call him that again I’ll put your
head through the wall.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What? You mean Snoop?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy, is
what White Boy’s trying to say. He’s a little crude, you understand. No,
I left that Snoopy shit behind me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But you call this bozo White Boy?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: White Boy Bob. White Boy used to be a
fighter.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s he do now outside of shoot his mouth
off?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Like being back in the yard, huh?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back
down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the
cold?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Glenn didn’t tell you?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I thought you guys were busted.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why? Just because you left us standing on the
side of the road?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Look, Snoop, I don’t know what Glenn promised
you or what you think you’re gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get
half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn cut
up the rest is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let’s go outside and talk.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What’s the matter with right here? It’s nice
and warm.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Warm? Man, it’s ninety-five degrees in
here, sometimes a hundred – the way Emanuel always kep’ it so his boys’d
sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns. No, I ain’t talking any
business in here. To me this is holy ground, man. You understand? I got
to be someplace anyway. Y’all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow
night, we’ll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We’ll see you tomorrow then.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: White Boy, how much is the reward on the
man again?</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Ten gees.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or
alive?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m looking for Ray Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He’s inside. With everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Called themselves the Youngboys.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Ironic, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How are you, Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Freezing. But I’m getting warmer.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Quite a mess.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to
buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with
crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was
saving up for an operation.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What is it with crack and transsexuals?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these
girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah. I saw one of ’em outside.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yonelle. Looks like someone raped her, shot
her, then threw her out the window. Fuckin’ animals.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Let’s get some air.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Other than we had so much fun the last time we
worked together. You gonna tell me why you’re comin’ to me instead of
the FBI?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I report to the FBI, first thing they’re
gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: You know, I’m not in homicide any more.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yeah, I’m crimes against persons and property
now, also sex crimes and child abuse.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Detroit, you must be pretty busy.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are
big, too.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy
Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn’t make it stick. In
his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and
look into job opportunities – if you can believe that.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Who was the friend?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as
Snoopy, a former prizefighter.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He’s a fuckin’
wackjob thinks he’s Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other
Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll need a last known address.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: That’s fine, but I don’t want you to talk to
Miller alone.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come on, Raymond, I’m a federal officer, I’m
armed.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Yes, you are. I’ll call you tomorrow with the
address.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You have the paper?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It’s a terrific shot of her.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Outside of that.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Doesn’t say what she’s doing up here, but I
don’t think it has anything to do with us.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: She came up here on her vacation, ’cause she
likes shitty weather.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I think she’s after Glenn. The girl still
with you?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They don’t stay the night, Jack, ’less you
pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You tell your sister about it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Just hung up.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How long you talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Two hours.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How long were you with the girl?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You didn’t tell your sister about Ripley, did
you? ’Cause I don’t wanna go through that again.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco’s
tailing Glenn, we’re fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get
picked up.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Let’s drive by where we’re meeting and have a
look. Maybe take a look at Ripley’s place while we’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I guess next time I see you, you’ll be
wearing a suit and tie…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I still haven’t made up my mind yet.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What’s to think about?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You goin’ right back to work?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: First, I’m goin’ to Israel for a year, study
the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz… then come back, maybe take some tennis
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Here… Something to remember me by.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s not the real thing, but it’s still nice
to look at.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: See you on the outside, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hi! I just broke outta jail!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Atheneum Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Karen Sisco, please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sorry, but there’s no one by that name
registered.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Best Western…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Moselle Miller?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m looking for Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: You find him, tell him the dog got run over
and I’m out of grocery money.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Moselle. Who you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Lady looking for Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: What’s she want?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Hasn’t said.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s not Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: That’s Kenneth, my brother. He’s talking on
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Ask what she want with him?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: You ask her. Maurice’s business is none of
my business.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: How do I know?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: The State, huh. Who’s fighting?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: You like to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m looking for a friend of mine I think
Maurice knows.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: You not with probation, one of those?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: You a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, I’m not. Maybe you know him. Glenn
Michaels?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Glenn? No, I don’t know any Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He said he stayed here last November.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Here? In this house?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He said he stayed with Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Well, he ain’t even here that much. I like
to know where he goes, but at the same time I don’t want to know, you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Your dog was killed?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Got run over by a car.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What did you call it?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: Was a she, name Tuffy.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Where do you think I might find Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: I don’t know – the gym, the fights. I know
he don’t miss the fights. Having some tomorrow night at the State
Theater. He use to take me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The State Theater?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What you want with Maurice?</p>
<p><strong>moselle</strong>: She looking for a man name of Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Did I ask you? Go on out of here. Do
something with yourself.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re a fighter?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: How you know that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I was…</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Till I got my retina detached two time.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’d you fight, middleweight?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Light to super-middleweight, as my body
developed. You go about what, bantam?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Flyweight.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You know your divisions. You like the
fights? Like the rough stuff? Yeah, I bet you do. Like to get down and
tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use
to get down on the floor and tussle. I say to her, “You a good dog,
Tuffy, here’s a treat for you.” And I give Tuffy what every dog love
best. You know what that is? A bone. I can give you a bone, too,
girl.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re not my type.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Don’t matter. I let the monster out, you
gonna do what it wants.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Bring your own rubbers with you?</p>
<p><strong>kennethn</strong>: What else you have in there, mace? Have a
whistle, different kinds of female-protection shit?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I have to go, Kenneth.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Maybe we’ll see each other again, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: We gonna tussle first.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: God damn…</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You wanted to tussle, we tussled.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I wrote my hotel number on there – in case
you run into Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Now that’s a really big house.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks
like a prison.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No doubt the man’s got some big-ass security
system.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he
wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah? You think he’ll let us in, we got
Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Who says anybody’s gonna be with us? I say we
go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop’s big plan is, then
go in ahead of those guys – alone.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we’re
off livin’ the good life.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone
who’s actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?
Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don’t
know anyone who’s actually gone and done it. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What about that D.B. Cooper guy?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I mean, they don’t know for sure he’s dead.
Look, there’s always a chance we’ll walk out’ve there with nothing. I
say let fate decide.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Let fate decide? What’re you, the fuckin’
Dali Lama now?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: My sister believes in fate, but not hell.
That’s why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don’t hear
that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to
pray I don’t fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there’s a hell,
Jack?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, it’s called Glades Correctional
Institution and I’m sure as shit not going back there or any place like
it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You might not have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They put a gun on you, you’ll go back.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They put a gun on you, you still have a
choice, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hearn</strong>: I think you’re gonna fit right in…</p>
<p><strong>mr. hearn</strong>: Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that
you would be happiest working down here in Miami. How’s that sound to
you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hearn</strong>: You’re about a 42 long, right?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hearn</strong>: Okay. Let’s see how she fits.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hearn</strong>: Your uniform.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Sir, you can’t go in there…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Jack? Whoa– what’s the problem? Take it
easy, let’s talk…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: A security guard? Are you fucking kidding
me?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You know, I wasn’t sure you’d show up. But I
was pretty sure that, if you did, you’d throw the job in my face.
Understand something, Jack. Up to this point, everything you’ve done
with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world. Less than
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’re a bank robber. This is not a
marketable skill. There are no old bank robbers out in the world living
on pensions. You know this. That’s why you’re here right now.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Today, I’m offering you a lousy job at a
lousy wage. You think you’re better than that? Fine. Show me. Show me
that you’re really willing to change and we’ll talk about something
better. A lot better. But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How, Dick? The way you earned it? By marrying
some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then
divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the
bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you
were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a
dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. Till you were
nothing. I saved your ass. So you’ll pardon me if I don’t wanna sit on a
fuckin stool all day saying “sign in here please” or “hey, pal, you
can’t park there.” Okay, Dick? I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Jack, I’m disappointed. I guess I misjudged
you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hey, what job he promise you guys?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: There’s two ways we can do this.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah? What are they?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Gentlemen. I think we’ve calmed down now.
Haven’t we, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oh, yeah, I’m calm. In fact, I’m totally
“relaxed…”</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few
other things before tomorrow. Why don’t you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
we’ll hook up later?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, and I better call my sister.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jack Daniel’s, please, water on the side.</p>
<p><strong>executive guy’s voice</strong>: Celeste, do us again, please,
and put the lady’s drink on our bill.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: They want to buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I get that. Tell them I’d rather pay for my
own.</p>
<p><strong>executive guy</strong>: Excuse me. My associates and I made a
bet on what you do for a living.</p>
<p><strong>executive guy</strong>: And I won. Hi, I’m Philip.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If it’s okay with you, Philip, I’d like to
just have a quiet drink and leave. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Don’t you want to know what I guessed? How I
know what you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Tell you the truth, I’m not even mildly
curious. Really, I don’t want to be rude, Philip, I’d just like to be
left alone.</p>
<p><strong>executive guy #2</strong>: I think I know why you’re
depressed – if I may offer an observation.</p>
<p><strong>executive guy #2</strong>: I have a hunch you’re the new
sales rep and your customer isn’t exactly knocked out by the idea of a
young lady, even one as stunning as you, handling the account. Am I
close? Hi, I’m Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’re ad guys. We flew in from New York this
morning to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery, present this test-market
campaign for their new margarita mix. What we do, we show this guy who
looks like a Mexican bandido, you know, with the big Chihuahua hat, the
bullet belts–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Andy? Really. Who gives a shit?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Want to tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Beat it, will you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Can I buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah, I’d love one. Would you like to sit
down?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m Gary.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m Celeste.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It takes hours to get a drink around here.
There’s only one waitress.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I can go to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Those guys bother you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, they’re all right. I meant, you just got
here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You like bourbon?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Love it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me,
Celeste. What do you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m a sales rep. I came here to call on a
customer and they gave me a hard time because I’m a girl.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Is that how you think of yourself?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What, as a sales rep?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: A girl.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t have a problem with it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I like your hair. And that suit.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I had one just like it – well, it was the
same idea, but I had to get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It smelled.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Having it cleaned didn’t help, huh?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No. What do you do for a living, Gary?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How far do we go with this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Not yet. Don’t say anything yet. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t think it works if we’re somebody
else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know
about anything?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s your game. I’ve never played this
before.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It’s not a game. Something you play.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, does it make sense to you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It doesn’t have to, it’s something that
happens. It’s like seeing a person you never saw before – you could be
passing on the street – you look at each other and for a few seconds,
there’s a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then
the next moment the person’s gone, and it’s too late to do anything
about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it
go, and you think, “What if I had stopped and said something?” It might
happen only a few times in your life.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Or once.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why don’t we get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I called your room from downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If I had answered, what were you gonna
say?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Well, I’d say who I was and do you remember
me and ask if you’d like to meet for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If I remembered you. I came looking for you.
I would’ve said sure, let’s do it. But for all you knew I could show up
with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It would be worth the risk.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You like taking risks.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’s the hurry, Jack? You have to be
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sooner or later…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You really wear that suit.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s not what you were about to say.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Remember how talkative you were? In the
trunk? Adele said you do that when you’re nervous.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She did, huh.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, but in a nice way.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I might’ve smelled like a sewer, but you
could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice
guy.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He killed a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I hear he didn’t mean to. The cop fell as
Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know that Sig .380 you took was my
favourite. My father gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What were you gonna do with me?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know. I hadn’t worked that part out
yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn’t want to leave you
there, never see you again.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You waved to me in the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I wasn’t sure you caught that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I couldn’t believe it. I was thinking of you
by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if
we could take a time-out…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we
could call time and get together for a while.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You know I saw you on the street.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Outside Adele’s.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You were going to see her?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: To warn her about Chino.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So she did help you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t think we should get into that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, you’re right. Or Buddy. I won’t ask if
he’s with you or what you’re doing here in Detroit. Or if you’ve run
into Glenn Michaels yet.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Don’t talk like that, okay? You scare me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you gonna leave your tie on?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: My God, look at you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You having fun?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You coming back?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m just going to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I want you to know something. I wasn’t
looking for just a fuck, if that’s what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.
Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked
a US Marshal. You think I will?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a
bottle he says is nitroglycerin. He scores some cash off a teller, he’s
on his way out when he drops the bottle. It shatters on the tile floor,
he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they’ve got him. The nitro
was canola oil. I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know
what they’re doing. I doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees
one. Most bank robbers are fucking morons. To go to bed with a bank
robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you’d have to be as dumb as they
are. I know you’re not dumb, so why would I think that? Why would you
think I might think that?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re not dumb.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know about that. You can’t do three
falls and think you have much of a brain.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You getting serious on me now?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m trying not to. I just wanna know what’s
gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair
of shoes?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I saw Karen Sisco.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And she saw you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yes, she did.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So how’s that work, a wanted felon
socializing with a U.S. Marshal?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You know how I felt about her.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Did you give her a jump? If you did I might
begin to understand where your head’s at.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It wasn’t about getting laid. I just wanted
to know what might’ve happened if things were different.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You find out?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So what’s that mean? That you’re disappointed
by what you found or you’re sorry you robbed all those banks?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Stick and jab, stick and jab!</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: You drink like a girl.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I got to go take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: What’re you telling us for? You want
somebody to hold your little pecker?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Jesus, I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems
to go right?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I don’t have the keys.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I see that.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I mean I’m not stealing the fucking car.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I already stole it. Last week or whenever it
was, in West Palm. I can’t be stealing it again, can I?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The two guys you were with – that one, that
isn’t Maurice Miller, is it? I’ve seen Snoopy’s mug shot and that didn’t
look like him.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Jesus. How’d you know about Snoopy?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Glenn, I know your life history, who your
friends are, where you’ve been and now, it looks like, where you’re
going. Put your hands on the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: You’re gonna bust me for picking up a
car?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison
escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Listen, these guys, they’re gonna be out here
any minute looking for me. They’re fucking animals.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’s going on, Glenn?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But I thought the whole thing was your
idea?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Rippin’ off Ripley was my idea, but these
guys, man, they’re into shit I can’t handle.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his
office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I
don’t give a shit what they do.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: And is Foley a part of this?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: He’s supposed to be, but he hasn’t shown up
yet, which is a good thing for him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect
the reward.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But you say he hasn’t shown up, you think he
backed out?</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I don’t know– he doesn’t exactly confide in
me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Gee, I wonder why not.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I’m freezing my ass off.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You want to get out of here, run, it’ll warm
you up.</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But listen, Glenn. If you’re lying to me…</p>
<p><strong>glenn</strong>: I know, you’ll find me. Jesus, I believe it.
I keep thinking if you hadn’t driven me to federal court last summer,
you wouldn’t even know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If I didn’t know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
you’d be in jail or dead. Look at it that way. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where you been? You miss the big boys, come
in time for the walkout fights. Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
chair.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and this is
Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Who’s sitting here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to
the men’s about a while ago and never came back.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: I think he must’ve fell in.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I sent these two looking for him, they come
back shaking their heads.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Well, if he left his coat and he’s been gone
a while.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: The car’s still there. I looked.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push him
off.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: The fuck you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Snoop, if you don’t know where Glenn is…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Look, what you worried about Glenn for?
What’s he know?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I thought everything.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Glenn knows everything we suppose to do
tomorrow. Glenn could tell somebody that, yeah, but it don’t mean shit.
You understand? ’Cause Glenn don’t know I changed the plan. It’s
happening tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Soon as we leave here. Stop home and pick
up what we need and go do it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You got two minutes, that’s all. Make up
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I wasn’t asking permission.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in
any trouble, opens his big mouth.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Whatta you wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You know they gonna set us up.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I get that feeling, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But you still think you can get the diamonds
fore they do?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’ll make you a deal. Get out of here. Right
now. I’ll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give
you half.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Half for doing what?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Getting me out of Glades for starters.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And who watches your back?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Man has all that reward on his head and
still talks like a con in the yard. You know what I’m saying? Like he’s
a man you don’t mess with. Yeah, well, what I say to Jack Foley is
buuullshit.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That what they’re wearing these days to break
and enter?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how
it’s done. Don’t waste any time. That’s how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: So you’ve done this before, huh?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Shit, yeah. White Boy even got busted for
it. White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary
that time.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: I left my wallet in the house I
robbed.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and
leaves his wallet on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s a wonderful story, Snoop. I’m very
excited about tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Hey. You learn from doing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You know how to use one a these?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’ve seen ’em used on TV.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Get ready to grab the wheel when I shoot this
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Do like he says, man. Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Shit –</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: “An army .45 will stop all jive.” Huey P.
said that.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You think he was talking about walking into
people’s houses when he said it?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Get ready to go skiing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Go on in the house before you get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: There’s still time, take me up on my
offer.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m not leaving you alone with these
assholes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I work here. I’m the maid.</p>
<p><strong>woman/maid</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, shit, we’re gonna have a party.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Not yet. Where’s Mr. Ripley?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I told you, he isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Out for the evening?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: He’s in Florida. Palm Beach.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: When’s he due back?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Jesus Christ, what difference does it make?
You want to wait for him?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Mr. Ripley’s down for the season. Christmas to
Easter.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You here all by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: That’s right, just me.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where’s Ripley’s safe at, he keep his
valuables in.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I don’t have any idea.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Let’s go upstairs, have a look at the man’s
bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in
the closets. The man has a safe, it’s gonna be up there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How about his place in Florida? If you’d
called, we could’ve checked his walls down there before we left. That
is, if you’d checked to see where he was. You follow me?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You set off any kind of alarm and you’re a
dead Hazel. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What’s you name, mama?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: First money, then pussy.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You ever wear one of these?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t ski.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Stay with the maid. I’m gonna have a look
around.</p>
<p><strong>raymond cruz</strong>: I’ll send a unit over there, see if
there’s anything going on.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Tell me where Ripley’s house is. I’ll meet
them there.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Karen, you gonna promise me you’re not gonna
go in, do anything stupid till I get there…</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Hey–</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: I found a rubber.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: White Boy, the man’s not gonna hide no
diamonds under the fuckin’ mattress.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where’s Foley?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Checkin’ the other rooms, like you said.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Go keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I don’t recognize none of these bands.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Just pick one, put it on.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Uh, Foley?</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They cut the lines, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Foley? That you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How are you, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing
here? What’s going on? Who’s upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Have they got Midge up there?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What kinda man lets a woman answer the door,
this time a night?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We thought it might be her husband.
Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in
Florida.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: A minute or two, you’re gonna wish you
were.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why don’t you come on over here, sit down,
Richard, have a look at your fish.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: How do I look, mama?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Like a fag.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I think she like to tussle with me. Get
boned a way she gonna remember.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: I found the safe.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: White Boy! Get your ass up here!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What do you want from me, Jack? Name it. You
want money?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You gonna write me a check?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We’ll go to my bank. I’ll make a
withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They found the safe.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You remember Buddy, don’t you, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, hi. Nice house.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: We gonna open up this fucker…</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Jesus…!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Good God… they’re shooting Midge!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Siddown, Dick. They’re trying to open the
safe, not your maid.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: A’ight, this time we gotta get the
motherfuckin’ trajectory right… Okay, on three: One… Two…</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: The combination is three-ten-forty-four.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Richard’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: …the fuck is this…</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Are they dead?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Go find Foley. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I can’t believe you’re still angry with me,
Jack, after all this time.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m not angry, Richard. In fact, I’m
completely relaxed. Thing is, I can’t tell if it’s the fish that’re
cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank
there.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Damn–</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there’s about five
million worth in there, wouldn’t you say, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Five point two.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: They look like plain old rocks.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They sure do.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Go get a bag.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I were you, I’d get up and run.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’m not leaving Midge.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Don’t be an asshole, Richard. They’re gonna
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: If that’s my fate, so be it. I’m not
leaving. I love her, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Good luck, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Someone down here?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Well, if it isn’t the Ripper hisself.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Are those my suits?</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where you been hiding, Dick?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: They’re gonna rape the maid, aren’t they.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: From the looks of those boys, the Ripper
too.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And then they’ll kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: We made it, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: All you gotta do is get in.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m going back inside.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport.
I’ll take one of Ripley’s cars.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Jack –</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Listen, Buddy, the shit that’s about to go
down, you’ll be on the phone with your sister for a month. Let me do
this part alone.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m saying this isn’t your problem. Far as
I’m concerned, we’re square.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Now get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Midge.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Forget about her. Tell me where the money’s
at.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Foley’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Where the fuck is Foley?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Midge?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Midge!</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: You take the front stairs, I’ll take the
back.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Where’s Dick?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Downstairs. But wait here. There’s two
more.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Hold it, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Drop the gun.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Now stay right there. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Maurice! I got Foley!</p>
<p><strong>white boy bob</strong>: Maurice! Up here!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You learn from doing.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Jack, you don’t use a gun, do you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Not until recently.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>maurice</strong>: This kind of setup, you don’t have any idea
what the fuck you’re doing – do you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re right. So why take a chance–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: We’re a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay
outta the house till we get there, understand?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh-kay…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>midge</strong>: This what you want?</p>
<p><strong>midge</strong>: It’s empty.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Maurice–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know you’re up there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come on, Jack – don’t.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Pretend I’m somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You think I’d shoot you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: If you don’t, one of those guys will.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’re you now, a desperado? Put the guns
down.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I told you, I’m not going back.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t do this. Please.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No more time outs.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You win, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Karen, I told you not to–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Wait, I know him –okay?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m sorry, Jack, but I can’t shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You just did, for Christ sake.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I wish things were different. I’m sorry,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>midge</strong>: Richard!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Listen, Jack… What’d you do with my
diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: The airport.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They don’t know yet if they want to bring him
up on the homicides.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I doubt if they will. The Bureau’s put a
detainer on him, so when they’re through with him here he’ll go back to
Florida.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You gonna go get him?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s possible. Why?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I was just thinking… you could have a nice
time with him on the plane – like picking up where your interlude, or
whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him
to rob banks.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: My little girl, the tough babe.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Foley.</p>
<p><strong>federal marshal</strong>: Have a nice trip. I’ll get the
other one.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I got you a present, something for the
road.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I have to take it away, though, soon as the
ride’s over.</p>
<p><strong>federal marshal</strong>: Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hejira? What kinda name is that?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Islamic.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What’s it mean, “No Hair”?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from
Mecca in 622.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: The flight?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the
name.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You were at Leavenworth, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: For a time.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Meaning time came, I left.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You busted out?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: I prefer to call it an exodus from an
undesirable place.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And how long was it before they caught up
with you?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: That time?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: There were others.</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Yeah. That was the ninth.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: The ninth?</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I
walked away from.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You must be some kinda walker, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Hejira.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: And so now you’re off to Glades.</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave
last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to
wait.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She did, huh.</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one
van.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we’d
have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>hejira</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a long way down to
Florida.</p>
