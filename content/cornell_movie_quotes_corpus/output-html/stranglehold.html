<p><strong>concorde/new horizons</strong>: 11600 San Vicente Blvd. Los
Angeles, CA 90049</p>
<p><strong>chemco malaysia–1st anniversary</strong>: This is just the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Just twenty miles from Kuala Lumpur
something big’s happening. That something is providing jobs for
families. That something is revitalizing a once-depressed local economy.
That something is developing new technologies for today’s ever-demanding
world. That something – is Chemco.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: It’s been a year since Chemco opened
it’s Malaysian operations, and the venture is a great success, not only
for Chemco but for the employees that make up the Chemco family. For
Chemco provides regular wages, benefits, and technical training that
will allow them to compete well into the next century…</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Okay, we have about an hour. At 2 o’clock we
have to be in Malacca and at 8 o’clock we have a dinner in Singapore
with the International Conference of Bankers.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Looks like they’re already underway.
Ready?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Ready as I’ll ever be. God it’s humid…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I’ll lead.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Why? Are we going dancing?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I said I’ll lead.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What are you going to do, Cooper, throw
yourself on a Bunsen burner? It’s a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.
We’ll be out in no time.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I gotta keep you alive–it’s in my
contract.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: If you’re working for me you’re going to do
what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I’m not working for you, remember? And I’m
not too thrilled about this either–</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Helen–we’re already behind schedule.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Let’s just get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: The Chemco legacy began in Cleveland,
where 40 years ago Louis Spencer took a small pharmaceutical company and
made it one of the largest corporations in the world. Today, first-time
Ohio congresswoman Helen Filmore stops by to see how Louis Spencer’s
dream continues to grow.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Helen this is Peter Olo, director of public
relations Pacific region, Peter this is Congresswoman Helen Filmore of
Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: We’re deeply honored, Ms. Filmore. Malaysia is
most appreciative of all that your country has given us.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: The people here are lovely, Mr. Olo. I am
the one who is honored, and filled with appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Shall we get started?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: Certainly. After you.</p>
<p><strong>gen mgr</strong>: …here we control the heat of the chemical
wash that we use to refine the ore…making it suitable for safe shipping
through a complex system of pipes to the waterfront. It’s then shipped
to Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: And that’s creating new jobs there as well,
giving the Buckeye state a much needed boost to its economy.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Can we break for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I just need a drink of water. Is there a
fountain nearby?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: Uh, well there’s a soda machine through that
door, down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: That’ll be fine–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Go get me a coke.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: No can do, ma’am. You know that. Have to
keep you in my site at all times.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Just get me a coke and don’t argue with me,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I’m not arguing. I’m just telling you what
the deal is–Congresswoman.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Look Cooper I don’t care what my father
says, if you embarrass me here you’re going to regret it,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: A soda sounds good. Get me one too. Diet
Lemon-Lime.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Anything else? Maybe a sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down
the hall. Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the
General manager:</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What’s next?</p>
<p><strong>gen mgr</strong>: Central Operations, straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You work here?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Where’s this soda machine?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You know, soda?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Uh…around that corner.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Thanks. You have a real nice day, you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: We are in Central Operations…the nerve
center of Chemco, filled with state-of-the art computers, processors,
and monitors. At Chemco, the visions of tomorrow are becoming realities
today…</p>
<p><strong>gen mgr</strong>: All activities in and around the plant can
be monitored and controlled from this room. Security is important to a
plant of this nature–</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: –and Chemco has an impeccable safety
record.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Any thoughts about Chemco or the new
plant that you care to comment on, Ms. Filmore?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I’d like to say it’s a source of great
pride to all of us in the States… to see the technology of today
embraced by a place like Malaysia…to know we’ve helped prepare it…for
the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Thank you, congresswoman…</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: Will that cover it?</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: It’s been a pleasure to meet you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gen mgr</strong>: The pleasure’s been mine, Ms. Filmore.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Uh, Helen?</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: They’re assembling management for a group
shot. They wanted to get you in there with them.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: It won’t take long–would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Of course not. Wherever you want me. A
cluster of MIDDLE-AND-UPPER MANAGERS collect in the center of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Looks like Yoo-Hoo for you pal.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Why don’t you just stand right here
about an arm’s length between Mr. Ojeda here– perfect–thaaat’s it. OK,
great, now can I have everyone’s attention?</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Our promotional directors have
requested a group shot of everyone saying the Chemco slogan in unison,
because it captures the essence of all your hard work here in this first
anniversary of the opening of this plant.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Now on the count of three if we could
all give a thumbs up and say “This Is Just The Beginning” you would make
the people back in Cleveland very happy.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Your idea?</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: This is news to me.</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Bear with me here, now on the count of
three. OK?…</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: One…</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Two…</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: This will be a shot to remember–</p>
<p><strong>spokesperson</strong>: Three!</p>
<p><strong>executives</strong>: This is just the beginning!</p>
<p><strong>back–</strong>: Cooper spins around to see FIVE GUNMEN aiming
at him–</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Take him to Richter. He likes Americans…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Enjoying the tour so far?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Are you going to kill us?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I don’t know. If you gave me a reason
to…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: For example…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: …take the fat man…</p>
<p><strong>gen mgr</strong>: Noooo–Noooo–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Now see, I didn’t like his tie…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: How goes the roll call?</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: We’re secured. Takeover team is in position
and accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: OK…Let’s get them downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: The bird is up. It’s show-time!</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: They didn’t kill us. It’s a good sign.
They’re not going to–you’re too important.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Where were your powers of appraisal when
you cleared them, Goddammit?!</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: The credentials he presented were…
impeccable.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I’m sure they were.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Don’t worry–“we’ll be out in no time.”</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Where were you for all this anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Getting you a soda, wimp-shit. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: How thirsty are you now? CUT TO</p>
<p><strong>executives</strong>: This is just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There’s more…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: We’re here with a live exclusive as the
world waits with baited breath for a break in the hostage standoff at
Chemco. Early this morning gunmen stormed the plant, taking it over,
killing several workers in the process. With me now is Chemco executive
Henry Alonzo.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen
demanding?</p>
<p><strong>alonzo</strong>: Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars
cash–or Chemco will be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Twenty-five-million! And what will they do
if the money isn’t delivered?</p>
<p><strong>alonzo</strong>: Th-th-they’ll kill one hostage every hour
until it is–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Does that include Helen Filmore, United
States congresswoman?</p>
<p><strong>alonzo</strong>: Y-yes–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Uh-oh! Do you know if the demands are being
taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are
just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?</p>
<p><strong>alonzo</strong>: Well, I-I hope that–that–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Times up!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: This is Gerald Richter, reporting live from
Malaysia. Don’t touch that dial!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Came over the satellite. We’re keeping the
bird clear should they call back.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: She’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: The transmission is an hour old…</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: Who is this–Gerald Richter?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: FBI has a Gerald Richter on file…twice
applied to the academy, twice denied… Court martial commuted to
dishonorable discharge from the navy…a classified diary was
confiscated…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: This was taken when Richter was arrested in
Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking,
skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his
demands. I can have the money there in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: The United States government doesn’t strike
deals with terrorists, Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: That plant and the applied technologies
therein are valued at upwards of a billion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: And–of course there is the human cost, which
is incalculable.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I’m sure you’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: I knew something like this would
happen. They must have killed Ryan Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Ryan Cooper! What the hell is he doing
there?</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: I hand-picked him for the job!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Who’s Ryan Cooper?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I’ll let the senator tell you.</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: Ryan Cooper was a secret service agent
that took a bullet for me as I left a press conference four years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Of course, of course–I remember that…</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: Then, when all the god-damned
allegations started, I found out that so-called friends have a way of
disappearing. I found his loyalty refreshing and never lost track of
him, even after he left the service. I sent him to protect my daughter,
but now…</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: …God they’ve got my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What are we going to do!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Who’s got matches?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: I have a lighter!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Even better.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Light it…</p>
<p><strong>vice president</strong>: Nooo! Please–God don’t do this!
Noooo–noooo–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Think of something. Please…</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Get back. Smile for the camera guys.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Have you broken it yet? We’ve got six more
heads and that means six more hours.</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: I’m in to the directory but they’ve codified
the stockpile–numerically.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Of course it’s codified! Each number
probably corresponds to a compound. Have them pull every compound from
the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out–that’s what
you’re here for.</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: I know what I’m here for-you don’t need to
remind me.</p>
<p><strong>bates</strong>: A crowd is forming outside, we got
helicopters overhead–they’re all over us.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>bates</strong>: We’ve got Washington on the line, we’ve got
Chemco on the line–they really want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Of course they do…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I think it’s time for a new
installment.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Something tells me you don’t want to be on
TV, friend.</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Richter-we got a problem!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: The monitor’s off. Someone’s fucking around
down there.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Really! They’re getting feisty, I like
that.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Find out what happened–and make an example
of whoever’s starting up. But don’t kill them–we need to count heads for
now.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: It was like that when I got here.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You did good. Real good.</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: I can handle one of those.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You can cover the rear.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: We’re outta here–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: –you have a dinner at eight, remember?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Tell us about the day you decided to work
for Chemco, that must have been an exciting moment in your life…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Would you care to shed some light on that
incident? I’m sure we’d all like to know about– The vice-president SPITS
in Richter’s face, keeping his steely gaze–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: This man slays me, ladies and gentlemen!
But I think we’re out of time, so–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: What happened!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: They’re gone!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: All of them?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah–they jumped us!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Jee-sus Christ! You have to be the
stupidest–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Good. We have an hour to find the
others–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: –or we use one of you.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Right…yes sir…agreed. I’ll let them know.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We’ve prohibited the networks from
broadcasting the transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We have a special forces squadron out of
Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: And what exactly do they intend to do?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: The ball is in Richter’s court. But we’re
sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates
people–we’re gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: I don’t think you–grasp–the situation,
Mr. Myers.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: What don’t we grasp, Mr. White?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Meeting violence…with violence… could have
serious repercussion… that’s all. Sen. Filmore and Myers exchange
curious looks.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Lieutenant Jackson sir!</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Sir we’ve got confirmed dead and I’ve got
people demanding to know what happened their relatives, wives –how do
you suggest we proceed sir!</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: Just continue what you’re doing–
placate, then dissipate! Tell them when we know, they’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What about the confirmed casualties,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: Just placate…then dissipate. For
now.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: How well do you know this place?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: We’re on sublevel six. We’ll pass some labs and
then we’ll hit the stairwell–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Are the labs in operation?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: I don’t see why they wouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You know what the boy scouts say,
Filmore–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: –be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: We don’t have time!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Yeah and we don’t have much ammo either!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Don’t wait on me! Take the stairs! I’m right
behind you–</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Let’s move it we got company!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What happened!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Get back!!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: SAVE IT!!!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: So, what are we looking at White?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What do they have in there that’s so
valuable? A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: I assure you gentlemen if we had something of
that magnitude it wouldn’t be shelved in a lab somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Is there anything in there that can blow? We
have to be ready for any contingency–</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There
are a number of volatile compounds– but they are safely stored away…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: How safely?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Chemco has…an impeccable safety record.</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t know what hit us! We had them trapped
on the stairwell. They could be anywhere now.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I now understand the expression “you get
what you pay for!” A bunch of chumps!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: Listen man, I don’t need this shit–</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Richter!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: We just won the lottery, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: KZ…7-0…7-0…nine. It checks out.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Excellent…excellent!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: You and the fuck-up squad were lucky. The
waiting game is over!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: And now, those fortunate enough to still be
alive–and working for this enterprise–we have reason to celebrate
indeed. We are all about to become… extremely wealthy men!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: But first, my friends, we’re gonna do a
little test marketing…</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: This is Jackson. Were getting nowhere
fast, request authorization for full civilian clearance of the area.
Roger that…</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen we are faced with
a hostile takeover! These men are armed and dangerous and you are
hampering our ability to end this situation!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: My husband is in there! I demand to know what
happened!</p>
<p><strong>lt jackson</strong>: Look! The sooner you cooperate with us,
the sooner we’ll know what’s going on in there. But for the time
being–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: LIEUTENANT!</p>
<p><strong>lt jackson</strong>: Everyone hit the ground! Now!!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Breathe in–close your eyes!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A TELEVISION SCREEN–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Gerald Richter here with an air quality
update. I gotta say, it’s not that good.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: It just so happens we got our hands on your
KZ70709, and let me tell you, a little dab’ll do ya.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Given that, we feel it’s not too
presumptuous to ask for fifty million instead. No there’s nothing wrong
with your television, that’s FIFTY MILLION. We have operators standing
by so pick up the phone and call! This offer’s good while supplies
last!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: Just what the hell is he talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: We’ve…been developing a product… KZ
70709.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you tell us this was at
stake!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: Chemco’s been developing nerve
gas?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Chemco makes many things senator! We were
under government contract!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I haven’t been briefed on any such thing!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Apparently, this project is–unique. But it’s
heavily protected–all formulas are heavily codified!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What the hell is it, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Well, it’s a binary formula–a precise amount
of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the
atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: How much do they have?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Of the separate chemicals–I don’t know, uh,
offhand–</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: How much of this shit do they have,
White!!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: They must have got their hands on a test
vial!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: There’s enough in one vial…</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: …to kill everything for miles.</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: I don’t understand this! I don’t
understand why they don’t listen! Why they don’t talk! Dammit don’t they
see we’re willing to agree to whatever they want!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: If those bastards touch one hair on my
daughter’s head I swear to God I’ll hunt them down straight to the gates
of hell!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: How’s the arm?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: It’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: We wouldn’t have made it out without you.
FILMORE Or without you.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I guess I owe you an apology, Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I wasn’t angry with you I was angry with
him.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: He’s a very stubborn man sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: You should listen your old man more often.
He’s got principles.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to
defend me. He’s loyal to the end. Even if it’s not–politically correct
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Let me tell you something Cooper! I never
once bad-mouthed him during all those months–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: No but you didn’t defend him either! Didn’t
want to rock the boat. Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was
acting under legal counsel!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Like I said–it’s a question of trust.</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Look, what are we going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: The only way out is to go back the way we
came.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: That ain’t gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: We’ll hideout here till nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Where the hell could they have gone!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck
’em–we don’t need ’em.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I want the girl. I don’t care about the
rest–but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy.
We’ll make headlines all over the world…</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: You’re fucking crazy Richter–you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Yeah? You jumped on the bandwagon soon
enough–I can’t be that crazy, can I–Smitty?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Go hunt them down–I don’t care if you have
to check the whole plant– earn your money!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I want the girl… DISSOLVE TO</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Gonna be a hell of a long night,
lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: We’re just going to have to stand and
wait.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: The son-of-a-bitch really has us by the
short hairs, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Cooper…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Yeah?…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What happened that day…at Leizburg?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Liezburg…man…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Standing watch over our Ambassador… at a
garden party in a friendly nation…what could be cushier… but we heard
screams…gunmen were hijacking a school bus of children… I made a
judgment call.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the
cries…violating the first rule of service…I let the Ambass- ador out of
my sight.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: By the time I got back to the party our
ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What they call the end of a career… and the
beginning of…a lot of shit.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: You’re a lot like my father, Cooper… you
think with your heart.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Used to Filmore, used to.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: We’re getting warmer.</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: That’s it! Up ahead!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Where does it lead?</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: The maintenance hatch–it takes us outside the
building!</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Run!!!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Jump! JUMP!</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: Are you alright!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Where’s Atkins?</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: Ahh Jesus, it’s broken–</p>
<p><strong>olo</strong>: He’s hurt!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: It’s not broken–</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: It is! It’s broken!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: C’mon let’s go–while we have a chance!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Get the gun!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sir all checkpoints report seeing
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Whatever happens I want them to hold their
fire!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: They’re up to something…and we’re goddamn
helpless…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: What’s happening at the waterfront?</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: We’re almost done piping in directly to the
Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Where’s the camera? I’m coming up with all
these great ideas…</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: We got trouble. That bodyguard son-
of-a-bitch has them running all over the field–just took out three on
the north end!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Well get someone down there!</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: There isn’t anyone! He’s opened that whole
sector now!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: That bastard’s trying to upstage me!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Is he with the girl?</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I don’t know–look! They can get in now, man!
We got no one left to guard it!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Then what are you standing here for? get
down there! Now!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: There’s the fence…</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: We’ll never make it! There’s no place to
hide–we’ll be cut down!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: How badly do you want to get out of
here?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Atkins is right–they’ll kill us for
sure!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I’m going first. Taking the fire. If we go
out together we’re all dead!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: They probably have guards on the roof–and
they’re gonna be firing at me–not you! ATKINS What makes you so
sure?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Because I’ll be firing at them.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: You’re talking about committing
suicide!</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: I say we go back that way!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Around the building? On your bum leg? You
have to get out of here right now!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Look you’re supposed to save my life! It’s
in your contract, remember?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: That’s right. It’s in my contract.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: What about rule one: never let the person
you are protecting out of your sight!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Rule two: without alternative, use yourself
as a shield.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Don’t worry about me, Filmore. Your father
owes me a week’s pay– and I intend to collect it.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: In a minute you’re going to hear gunfire–if
you want to live you’ll run for that fence as fast as you can! Cooper
and Atkins exchange looks–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Understand?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Goodbye–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: COOPER!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>atkins</strong>: We can’t! We’ll be shot!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>sharpshooter</strong>: I got the congresswoman in
range–she’s– trying to escape–someone’s after her–</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!!!</p>
<p><strong>sharpshooter</strong>: I can get him!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Goddamn it hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Secret service–hold your fire! We got
hostages coming out this way!!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I said FREEZE! Or I’ll blow your fucking
head off–</p>
<p><strong>burns</strong>: I got the girl.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Oh that’s good news–good news! Bring her up
here! Just in time for our final episode.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I tell you everything is shaping up just
fine, my friends…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I caught this one out back sir!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You idiot! Put the gun down!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Goddammit where is she?!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: A for effort Cooper–they grabbed her going
over the fence–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: It was a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Lt. Jackson sir! The satellite’s up again!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Well well, I’d like to give a word of
thanks to our secret serviceman. If he’s providing a service, it sure
seems secret to me!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Whatever the case, I’m honored to have such
a lovely panel guest for this final taping. I’m sure my television
family understands when I say we’ve been through a lot of laughter, and
a lot of tears together. How do you feel about that, Helen?</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Go fuck yourself…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Hey now! No cussing on TV! Well in closing
I’d like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in
an hour. One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of
tens of thousands of people–people just like you and me!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: God bless each and every one of
you…goodnight. The transmission ends–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I have a score to settle with him…</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Senator they have Ryan Cooper–he made it
out!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: I don’t understand–I don’t understand
at all!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: He requests permission to re-enter the
compound!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Permission denied–he had his chance! Any sign
of assault and they’ll blow the place!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: He’s insisting sir!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: I want him to keep his ass out of it!
Restrain him if you have to! Or we’ll have another Leizburg on our
hands!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: OK–I got it. Right–yeah its here–Roger!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What the hell is the problem!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: The problem is I have orders from
Washington–so cool you’re ass off! No one goes anywhere! We’re gonna
make the deal!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I’m sorry, Cooper!</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Let me take a look at that shoulder–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’m glad you’re still around Helen– we have
a lot of catching up to do.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I hope you don’t mind all this–it’s just
that the networks will eat it up, you know…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: You’re going to pay for this…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: You got it all backwards, Helen–but that’s
OK, you work for the government…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I will be getting paid for this–how much I
don’t know, but let’s put it this way–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: It’s not gonna fit in a damn suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: What do they think they’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>lt jackson</strong>: COOPER?!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Get me Washington!</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Someone just went over the fence south
end!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Our first deserter–who was it?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: No–INCOMING INCOMING–he’s inside–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Sounds like I have to have a talk with the
boys in D.C… EXT CHEMCO</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: There’s been an explosion, we have
scattered gunfire–I don’t know if they’re going to blow the place… Roger
that!</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: Get everyone on stand by–alert status!
We might have to move!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I thought we had a deal.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Of course we have a deal! We have cash on
site! Everything you asked for!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I told you to keep everyone at bay. You let
me down!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: He’s not our man dammit! We can’t stop
him–he’s a loose cannon!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’m very disappointed, gentlemen, very
disappointed…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’m sorry but we’re outta time!</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: Helen!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Don’t do this! We held up our end damn it!
What more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I want to thank Chemco–for making the world
a deadlier place to live.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: That…bastard…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Well I guess it’s anchor’s aweigh! So long,
suckers!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: You’re a natural in front of the camera,
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Choppers are ready. Let’s get the fuck out
of here. RICHTER It’s time gentleman–I hope you enjoyed the tour–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Now the fun begins Helen–you like to
travel?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Step lively–step lively–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: We can take either one of them out now,
sir–</p>
<p><strong>lt. jackson</strong>: We haven’t got authorization! They
still have a hostage–</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Get everyone out of here–They’ve timed it
to blow!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: We came, we saw, we looted–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’ll tell ya life is a gas… when you’ve got
a pretty girl by your side–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Hooooo-eeeee!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Cooper…</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: We got two choppers headed east-
northeast–get special forces on their tail–now!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: He’s got the nerve-gas.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: We may have to take them down!</p>
<p><strong>sen filmore</strong>: Are you mad! My daughter’s on one of
those helicopters!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: If they’re carrying enough nerve gas to kill
millions of people I’d say we have little choice, Senator!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: He wouldn’t take it on the helicopters. He’d
transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the
waterfront…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: They were probably topping off a docked
tanker while he stalled for time–without anyone being the wiser…</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: KZ70709 would be worth hundreds of millions
on the black market.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: He doesn’t even need her…</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: What about Cooper–where is he?</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: He’s in there…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: This guy Richter just upped the stakes. It’s
time we cracked down.</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Don’t worry Henry. We won’t let them out of
our site–this isn’t over yet…</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Right on time, Richter–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Helen this is Captain Stockton– Captain,
Congresswoman Helen Filmore, the pride of Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Our traveler’s insurance, you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Gotcha. We’ve been filling barrels all
day–we’ve got hell of a stockpile.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: I say we head out.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Agreed–let’s move it.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Are you hungry? We can discuss some final
arrangements over some slop in the galley.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Captain it would be impossible to turn down
such a gracious request.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: What say, Helen? You haven’t eaten all
day–and come to think of it– neither have I!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: My crew is going to work alongside with
your men, don’t worry–we’re a team!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Why should I worry? Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Well, there was uh, a little dissent about
the amount of the bonus–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Dissent?</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: You know, when we reach Kompong Som–</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: But I explained your generosity, and that
settled the whole matter.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: It’s good to be back in business with you
again, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: To the suckers of the world! Without them
we’d never succeed!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Helen’s a little upset. She lost her whole
entourage of hangers-on today– almost bought it herself, didn’t she?
Well don’t you worry Helen–from now on its smooooth sailing.</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: …I was a thousand miles from my old lady on
a free port and just got paid– ten grand in my pocket…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Merry Christmas…</p>
<p><strong>seasick</strong>: Oh my God…I’m gonna puke… where is that
shit…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I hope you enjoy your accommodations Helen.
I want you to enjoy your time here with us–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: You understand that they’re watching our
every move right now–you think you’re just going to sail away?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: It seems to me we are just sailing away.
They haven’t sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don’t you worry your
pretty little head about that. It’s all been taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I know you’re not too happy at this point.
It’s too bad we weren’t able to meet elsewhere, under different
circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Like where–in your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>seasick</strong>: Sorry–I was getting some seasick pills.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Not to worry…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: We were just saying goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Guard her. With your life.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Any news from Kompong Som?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yessir they’ve confirmed our E.T.A. and
they’re ready to pipe the cargo.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Good. Won’t be long now, my friend… soon
we’re gonna be very wealthy…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Call me…goddamn Ishmael…</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman1</strong>: Look at him–he’s ready to spew…</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman2</strong>: Looking a little green, brother…</p>
<p><strong>terrorist</strong>: I don’t know how you fucking do this!</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman 1</strong>: You have to get your sea legs. Hell
I used to get sick all the time.</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman 2</strong>: It’s easy when the boat is going UP,
and DOWN, and UP, and DOWN,…</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman 1</strong>: Man I got so nauseous once…it was
worse than the time I accidentally drank a cup of tobacco spit, could
have sworn there were a few loogies in it–</p>
<p><strong>terrorist</strong>: Jesus shut up!</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman 2</strong>: Man in rough weather this boat just
rocks, and rocks, and rocks… RANDY SEAMAN 1 Yeah and if you get bad cook
that just keeps feeding you salty pork all the time it’s enough to–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Who is it!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I want you out of here at once.</p>
<p><strong>randy seaman 1</strong>: Begging your pardon, ma’am–but your
wants don’t quite enter into it–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Helllp!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Cooper!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’m sorry what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I’m sorry about this. I’m going to have to
have a few words with Stockton–his men need a lesson in manners…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Perhaps you’ll find my quarters more to
your liking–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>engineer1</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Oh, hi. I’m one of Richter’s men.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Yeah. He wanted to make sure the boats on
deck are fueled…</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: They are.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Good. I’m beat enough as it is…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: God-damn…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: That’s one hell of an engine!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Far cry from the old outboard back home, you
know what I mean, boys?</p>
<p><strong>engineer2</strong>: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: This must power the turbines, huh?</p>
<p><strong>engineer1</strong>: Sorta, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Shit, what happens when this thing goes
down?</p>
<p><strong>engineer2</strong>: We got backup power over there.</p>
<p><strong>engineer1</strong>: Don’t worry junior, we’re prepared for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Yeah you’re prepared alright…</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: We’re steady on course Captain.</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: At least some of us are! No more drinking
on this goddamn ship!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: OK, Andrews lock her down–</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: She’s keeping a steady course, straight
for Cambodia…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Looks like Richter isn’t acting alone–he’s
heading into some dangerous waters.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: She’s as good as gone…</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: You can’t think like that! We’re watching
them like a hawk–he’s bound to trip up, make one false move–</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Richter can’t run forever.</p>
<p><strong>sen. filmore</strong>: I don’t know about that…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I suppose…you think I should thank you.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Yes, you should.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Overnight I’ve put us in the history books,
Filmore. It won’t be long till we’re legends in our own time.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Seems to me you’ll be dead soon,
Richter.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: One hostage is not enough–you’re a marked
man.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Much as I love you, Helen, you don’t think
I would have put all my eggs in one basket, would you? Anything funny
and…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: …they have a catastrophe on their
hands!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: No, I felt something when I first saw you.
And I know you felt something too.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: We’re one in the same, Helen. We both want
it all. And we’ll do what we can to get it–isn’t that the truth?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I watched you as your old man’s reputation
went down the toilet–“misappropriation of funds”–you stayed out of it
like a pro.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: You see, it paid off–you broke away from
the old guard, congresswoman. It won’t be long till they’re calling you
Senator Filmore–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: But it won’t be enough, it will never be
enough. I know. I understand you.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: To us…and to having everything.</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Come on, drink up.</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I don’t want any…</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I insist…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I said I don’t want any, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: I said–I insist!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: You’re a very headstrong woman– sometimes
you tend to forget the impulses of your body–your desires–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Let’s see what’s happening, princess–</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: The damn line’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: Rudder’s dead–navgation’s dead–</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Sounds like the goddamn engine blew!</p>
<p><strong>stockton richter</strong>: Who’s there! Who’s that!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: What the hell happened!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: We got trouble–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Are we adrift–</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: If I don’t get power up we are!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Drop the anchor!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: We can’t–it’s power driven!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Get your men to do it!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: The thing weighs more than a ton– you want
to roll up your sleeves and try it?!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Get this shit-crate running!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: This “shit-crate” just lost her main
engine–it isn’t like changing a bulb!</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: The auxiliary alternator can get us lit
and moving, but not for long–</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: Seems like we got ourselves a saboteur,
Richter!</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: We have a problem on our hands
gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Good shot!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Dump what barrels we can overboard and get
the launches ready–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I hope you know your Morse code. I got
something I want you to spell for me!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Don’t kill me please–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: The first letter is C…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: That wasn’t a C now was it–I’m gonna give
your sorry ass one more chance– The operator enters the correct
letter–</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Good–“O”–“O”–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: It looks like they’re changing course,
headed due north–</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Sirs!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: The coast guard is reporting a Morse
signal coming from the Olympia!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: A distress call?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Yeah–a distress call–</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Cooper–SOS–</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Fuck this! Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Cooper!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Come on princess–its time we had a talk
with your friend–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Cooper?!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Cooper I think you better come out–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Welcome back from the dead! I don’t know
how you did it but at this point I don’t really care.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: It’s over Richter. Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Over? You slowed up my cargo that’s for
sure but least we forget Cooper your assignment was to protect the
Congresswoman–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: So far your operation’s a success but it
would be a shame if the patient died now wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Now I want you to put the gun down–</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: So help me sweet Jesus Christ I’ll blow her
fucking brains out right here and now–PUT THE GUN DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>richter</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Cooper!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: JUMP!!!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Stay clear–</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: We’ve got survivors–about fifteen hundred
feet southwest!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Are you absolutely certain?!… Stand by!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>myers</strong>: Cooper got her out!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Well Filmore–</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: Well Cooper…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Looks like you’re not going to make that
dinner after all…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: I guess not Cooper…</p>
<p><strong>filmore</strong>: …but you can’t say we didn’t try…</p>
