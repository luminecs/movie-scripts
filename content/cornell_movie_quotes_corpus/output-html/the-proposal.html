<h1 id="the-proposal">the-proposal</h1>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the
sheets next to him answers. SIMONE is the model on the walls and is
really, really hot.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: In the kitchen. I think. Can I make you some
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry, I gotta go. I’m late. Richard
hurries to the kitchen. Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty
champagne bottle. Shoes in the sink. He finds his pants on the floor and
puts them on. RICHARD Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and
sees it tied to her headboard.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: In here. She unties the complicated knot.
Richard comes back half dressed. He swallows a little throwup.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Baby, I just can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re just too much for me. And I’m just
another guy too wrapped up in his job.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Fine. Whatever. Just go. Richard sits down
on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Let’s not end it like that. It’s been an
amazing three and a half weeks. Thank you. And you should know that you
have the nicest ass I’ve ever been with.</p>
<p>****: You mean it?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I do. It’s magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I work really hard on it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to
seductively pull the sheets off her naked body. Richard shakes his head
“no” and smiles. RICHARD I really gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I knew you would call! Now come on, tell
me what I want to hear. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You have to put it by your mouth so people
can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You should get paid extra for being so
darn funny. Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and
walks out the door. MARGARET This is Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: You’re running late today.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Jillian, you are the best.</p>
<p><strong>jillian</strong>: If you think I’m good at this, you should
use that coffee cup sometime. As he runs out the door, Richard glances
at his cup and smiles at Jillian’s name and phone number written in
Sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: See ya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker #1</strong>: How long is she gonna make us come in
by seven?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She doesn’t exactly consult with me on
these things.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker #1</strong>: Well this sucks ass.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Welcome to my nightmare. The doors close
as…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ve been thinking about our talk
because I’m right. Everyone does publicity. Roth, McCourt, Russo. Hell,
Chabon practically whores himself. Know what they have in common? A
Pulitzer. Yes, I know you haven’t done it in twenty years, but that’s
how long it’s been since you’ve written a book this good.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not pushing so you’ll sell more books,
I’m pushing because it’ll be a crime if the world doesn’t hear that you
wrote a genius piece of literature. Do the publicity. Margaret waits for
an answer and smiles when she hears “yes.” MARGARET You’re making the
right decision! Great news. Going into an elevator, think I’m going to
lose you… Margaret hangs up. Never give them a chance to change their
mind.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Good morning! Margaret quickly walks
by and gives only the slightest nod.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’ve got a conference call in thirty, a
staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for
you to sign.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Cancel the call, move the meeting to
eight,</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nice job.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: When I want your praise, I’ll ask for it.
Is Bob here?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sure. You want him on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We’re going to his office. Grab your pad.
Richard calmly backs out of the office…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That’s cute. You gonna call her today?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What? Richard doesn’t know what Margaret is
talking about, until she nods at the cup. He’s embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are you bored here? Do you need little
distractions like that to get you through the day?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You have another late night out?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m firing on all cylinders and you’ve got
hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you
wore yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh. Well, it won’t be wrinkled for
long.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ll magically unwrinkle?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You have magic pants?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. I’ve sprayed them with stuff that will
take care of the wrinkles.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Does this work on more than just your
pants?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anything that’s wrinkled.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Buy me some.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Will do. Richard makes a note. Margaret
stops to make her point.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I don’t care what or who you do on your
own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I
will not have your personal life affect you at work. If you want me to
think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and
professional. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Great. Now you’re just a prop in here, so
don’t say a word.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ah. Our fearless leader and her liege. Margaret
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m lettin’ you go, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: This isn’t working out.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You can’t…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
publicity. You said it was impossible.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It is. He doesn’t do publicity.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I just talked to him. He’s in.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No more buts, Bob. I’ve been chief for a
month and a half, and this is the third time you’ve dropped the ball.
You didn’t even call to ask him.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: All you had to do to was pick up the
phone. That’s it. Now I’ll give you two months to find a new job, and
then you can say you resigned. I won’t tell a soul, my lips are sealed.
Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s he doing? Richard turns around and
takes a peek. Bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He’s up and about to pop.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh Bob, don’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>you poisonous bitch! you can’t fire me!</strong>: The office
stops. This is going to be good. Margaret turns around with a
disappointed look on her face. She’s deadly calm.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What are you doing? I gave you a civilized
way out of this.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: This is because I’m your competition. Because I
threaten you!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, Bob. You could never threaten me. I’m
firing you because you’re lazy, entitled and incompetent. I’m firing you
because you don’t work hard. So if you know what’s good for you, you’ll
shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk.
Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security
and have you thrown out on your ass. Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods.
MARGARET Good. Now I’ve got work to do, so if you’ll</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No problem. I’ll just cancel my trip this
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I gave you the weekend off?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It was my Grandma’s ninetieth birthday. But
no big deal. You were right before, I need to stay focused.
Professional.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well tell gammy that I’m sorry. Mom, she’s
making me work this weekend. It’s not like I volunteered. I’m sure dad
is pissed. Margaret comes to Richard’s desk. He tries to wrap it up.
RICHARD I have to go. Yeah. No, I’m not going to do that! No. Sorta.
Mom! No. Bye. Richard hangs up the phone. RICHARD Sorry about that.
Damage control.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: She tell you to quit?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. No. Um. Yes? But as I’ve explained to
them, after three years together, you’re the only person on the planet
who can make me editor, so that’s the way it is. Richard’s phone rings
and he picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He said you knew each other. You weren’t
sure so you told me to set a meeting. We rescheduled on him four
times.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Go get him. But he’s out of here in five
minutes, we’ve got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her
office.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll charge up the cattle prod.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Margaret. Good to see you. I know
how busy you are. Congrats on the promotion. Read about it in P-W.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. Well, those announcements are silly,
aren’t they? Like everyone who needs to know doesn’t know already.
Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now
gives up. MARGARET Have to admit, I can’t place where we know each other
from. Gilbertson smiles. He didn’t expect her to remember.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Three years ago? We worked
together.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Don’t have it…</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Remember “Dandelion’s Desire?”
Margaret gets excited.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh my God, you read that manuscript with
me? That book is legend. Without a doubt the worst ever written.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It was a fever dream! 900 offensive and
pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird
disability. The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist?
Oh! And there was the asthmatic alien chapter – written entirely in his
alien language.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I believe there was a glossary…
Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Did you see the pass letter I wrote
him?</p>
<p>****: “Your grammar is impeccable, but please do not confuse superior
form with writing ability. Save your skills for the office newsletter,
you sir, are no writer.” A beat. Margaret says matter of fact…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You wrote the book.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re Dante Dickens?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: One of my nom de plumes. Gilbertson
paces. Margaret stays seated, at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. You
obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should
channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he
pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Ms. Mills, I’m with U.S. Citizenship
and Immigration Services, and I’m deporting you to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Excuse me? What? This is a mistake. I’ve
lived here since 1981. I’m applying for citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You need citizenship now? After the
big promotion?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes. And all the papers are in. Gilbertson
pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Well, my office is going to reject
your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is
well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States. We
must protect our sovereignty.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m a threat to the sovereignty of the
United States?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Yes, and unfortunately my
investigation will take awhile, so you’ll be deported while your case
winds through the system. Will it affect you at work if you aren’t
allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: “Affect me at work?” I’ll lose my job!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Ahhhh. That’s a shame. Too bad we
can’t work something out. Margaret stops looking at her file. It all
becomes clear.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, no. No, no, no. I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Do what, Ms. Mills?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I’ve edited it down. It’s
better.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well then, get it published at another
house.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: They all just don’t get me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: All?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Well not all. Two hundred fifty, two
hundred sixty-one. Ish.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ll be fired and laughed out of the
industry if I publish that book.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I’m at the end of my rope,
Ms. Mills. I’m an author. Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to
work everyday and lives in his brother’s garage. You’re the last stop,
and I’m desperate.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I will never publish your book. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: There’s no need to make this
difficult. I don’t turn in your file until Monday…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: This is blackmail. I’ll go to your
boss.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I’ve spent two years preparing for
this day. Don’t you think I’ve thought of that? Now Margaret is pacing,
while Gilbertson happily looks on. Suddenly, the door opens and Richard
bursts in, acting like there is an “emergency” so Margaret can end the
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
you right away. The sight of Richard inspires Margaret. She turns to
Gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Know what, Dante? I’m not going anywhere!
We’re getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Who’s getting married?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We are!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You and him?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is
all smiles. Richard is very confused. MARGARET Mr. Gilbertson is from
the INS. I told him about us. About us getting married.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You are marrying your male
secretary?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Assistant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You are marrying your male
assistant?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We’re in love. We tried to fight it. When
it’s right, it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: And this has nothing to do with my
visit here today?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Nope. True love. Got it bad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You. Is this true? Are you marrying
this… woman? Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Of course we are.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh-huh. Margaret smiles and snuggles up to
Richard so he can put his arm around her. Richard is truly afraid.
RICHARD I’m, uh, marrying my boss? Margaret turns and puckers her lips
to let Richard know that she’s ready for a kiss. The two slowly begin to
come together. Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard
chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Five years in prison and a two
hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: If I prove you’re lying, you go to
federal prison for five years. Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes
notes. MR. GILBERTSON You. Do you know what you’re getting yourself
into? We’re going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a
real couple would know about each other. Do you even know her favorite
color? Richard doesn’t answer. Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
veiled threat.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: C’mon. Answer. You don’t have a choice.
Richard doesn’t want to do this, but relents.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Plum.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You mean purple?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. Plum is “smokier” than purple.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Favorite flower?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Tulips. But only when they’re in
season.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Childhood pet name?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Miss Mittens.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are we done here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Who knows you’re getting married?
Margaret interrupts.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No one. With us working together we
decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Have you at least told your
family?</p>
<p>****: My parents are dead!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: How convenient. So you’re not
telling anyone that you are getting married?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his
pad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Pathetic. Four questions and I’ve
got enough to send you to prison…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We’re telling his family this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes. We are. We’re surprising them… …at
his Grandma’s 90th birthday party.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: And where’s that going to be?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: At Richard’s parent’s house.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: And where’s that located?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: In his hometown.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sitka.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Is that on Long Island? Only Richard
has the answer. Margaret tries to cover.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why don’t you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You’re going to Alaska this
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes. Of course we’re going to Alaska.
That’s where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around. He’s
getting worked up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You think you can beat me with this
B-S story? Forcing your secretary…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Assistant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: …assistant to marry you and then
conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry, Dante. Did you not prepare for
that? Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: The INS will see you both in ten
days for your official interview. Your stories better match up on every
account. Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret’s face as he gives her
the piece of paper. MR. GILBERTSON Cross all your T’s and dot your I’s
with this ruse, Ms. Mills.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: There are no “T’s” or “I’s” in “Love”
Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard. Margaret goes
back to her desk like this is all in a days work. MARGARET Why are you
from Alaska? Sweet Jesus, that’s inconvenient. So here’s what’s going to
happen. We’ll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your
parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard
doesn’t react. Margaret doesn’t notice. MARGARET So you need to figure
out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get
my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a
face. MARGARET But first, run down and get me another coffee from your
girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup. Richard
doesn’t move. MARGARET Hello? Richard? Richard! Richard says his first
words since Gilbertson left.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I quit. Richard leaves Margaret’s office.
She still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Richard, come back here. Margaret tries
not to make a scene. MARGARET Richard. Richard. Richard pushes the
elevator button in front of reception. MARGARET Come back to the office!
Richard can’t take it. He gets up in Margaret’s face.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You shut up. You just lost your “I get to
tell Richard what to do” privileges.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, we need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You want to talk with me? Fine. Grab your
broom and let’s go. Margaret is dumbstruck. The receptionist is shocked.
The elevator arrives and Richard gets in. Margaret follows. As the doors
close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist. RICHARD Watch my
phones!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Your plan is psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well I’d rather poke my eyes out than play
pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time. Sometimes you need to sack
up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Aren’t Canadians supposed to be nice?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You wanna be an editor? You need to
make</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK. Fine. Then if we “make this happen”?
You’re promoting me to editor.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m doing what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We go to Alaska and lie to my family? I
risk going to jail? Well, you’re making me editor for that. I mean, did
you think I’d do this out of the kindness of my heart?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You work for me!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You know, during my employee orientation,
the HR rep didn’t mention anything about me marrying you.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Look, I came to this town alone and with
nothing. I’ve worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to
ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time? No way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
sounds like your problem. Not mine. Margaret is stuck. Richard really
does have the upper hand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fine. You take me to Alaska this weekend,
and I’ll make you editor. Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake,
Richard takes it. MARGARET And I’m not sleeping on your parent’s hide-a-
bed, we’re staying in a hotel. Do they even have hotels in Alaska?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. But they have huts. Teepees really. And
you have to poop in a bucket. But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.
But with bears.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Um. Shouldn’t we talk about what we’re
going to say to my parents? Margaret doesn’t look up, annoyed with the
question.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are you done with the press release?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p>****: Well let’s finish big people business before mommy and daddy
talk. Okay? Dejected, Richard goes back to work.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So what do I need to know up there? Bullet
points.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I told ’em we’ve been dating for six
months. We’ve kept it a secret from everyone… …and that you’re a naughty
minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the
gate. Margaret is not amused by Richard’s attempt at humor.</p>
<p>****: Don’t make me hate you. Margaret hands her boarding pass to the
attendant and breezes through. The attendant gives Richard a look.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Bringing her home to meet my folks.
She’s</p>
<p><strong>gate attendant</strong>: I don’t care, sir. Richard finds his
boarding pass and hands it over.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK then. You’re a sweet lady. Thanks.
Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry, I hate it when people stare at
what I’m reading. It’s just… I worked on that book.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: You wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Edited it. It was one of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Well you did a good job. It’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You don’t see many guys with that book.
You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines?</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: My ex-girlfriend gave it to me. I
travel a lot for work. I’ll read anything…</p>
<p>****: Ex-girlfriend, huh?</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: OK, you got me. I’m a closet romantic.
But let’s keep that between us. Margaret smiles and makes the “my lips
are sealed” motion. Just then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the
bags.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: There you are. Give me my lap top. Richard
untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, he’s reading…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I know, Richard. Richard turns around and
puts the bags in the overhead compartment. The Handsome Man turns to
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Did you two want to sit together?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Sit together with who? The Handsome man
nods at Richard.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Your boyfriend? Margaret points to
Richard indignantly.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You mean him? The Handsome man nods.
Margaret tries to set the record straight. MARGARET No. No. No. He’s my
assistant.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: You’re bringing your assistant all the
way to Alaska? Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, you can tell him the truth.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, he’s… indispensable.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s me. Richard turns to close the
overhead compartment.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: You’re awfully nice to fly him first
class. Margaret nods her head and agrees. It sucks to be Richard.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: There he is!!! Where’s Margaret? Richard
blanches white. Margaret looks back with eyes that say “What the hell is
going on?”</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: That’s sweet. Richard goes over to the
group. Margaret keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What are you guys doing here? What’s with
the sign?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: So you’re “just dating,” huh? I can’t
believe you didn’t tell us!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Didn’t tell you what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We’re not saying anything until you let us
meet Margaret. Now, where’s our girl? Richard looks around. Margaret
keeps her head down and tries to avoid eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh. Margaret? You need to come over here.
Like now. Honey. The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people,
calling for Margaret to come over. Margaret winces.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I have to go now.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: What kind of sick shit is this?
Margaret nods. This would be a tough one to explain.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Have a great life. Margaret walks toward
the group. Richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for Margaret to
hold it. At the last second, she takes it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Everyone, this is Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: It’s nice to meet you. Now, do you
prefer being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady? We’ve heard it both
ways. Everyone laughs.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Annnie!</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: It’s not like he hasn’t told her that
he used to call her the Dragon Lady. They’re getting married.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now, ah, where did you hear that? The whole
“getting married” thing?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh, that man from the government. Gilber-
something. Said he was checking up on you two. Said it was technicality,
because Margaret was from Canada.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What, ah, did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well for one thing, that you were in a lot
of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. Really. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Just that you were coming up here this
weekend. That we hadn’t seen you in a while, and that we’d heard about
Margaret for years, but that we’d never met her. Debbie turns to
Margaret and takes both of her hands. DEBBIE The way that Richard talked
about you? I’ll admit, I didn’t see this coming.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Me neither. Debbie picks up some of the
bags and starts walking toward the exit. Everyone else follows her
lead.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: So why all the silly secrecy?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It wasn’t a secret. We didn’t tell
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, is your family just anyone?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I should be mad at you two. But, but… I’m
just so excited!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Oh, we cancelled your reservation.
You’re part of the family now. Family doesn’t stay at a hotel. Also,
we’ve got another little surprise for you two.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Surprise? Another surprise?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She’s not good with surprises.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m really not good with surprises.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well you two…</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: …you’re getting married this
weekend!</p>
<p><strong>margaret richard</strong>: What? What? GRANDMA ANNIE The
whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says
“what are you talking about?”</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: When Gilber-something told us you were
getting married…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: …God rest their souls…</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: …or friends…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: …we decided to give you a wedding.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Engagement party tonight…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: …and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are you witches?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Just quaint. During the solstice it’s
good luck. It’s an Alaskan thing.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We’ve planned everything. Margaret isn’t
sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: I’m old, Margaret. I don’t have much
time left. Richard lives so far away, and I never see him. Now I find
out he’s getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild’s
wedding day. It’s a dream come true for me. A dream come true. Please
let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat. Richard
doesn’t know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret doesn’t know what
Margaret is going to say. Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get
out… two big thumbs up. The crowd cheers.</p>
<p>****: The Dragon Lady!? Richard shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: To tell you the truth, we had a lot
of the plans made already for my birthday. Just a few changes here and
there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at
Richard.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m a lucky woman. Margaret does her best
to smile.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not getting out of this car until you
tell me where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on, it’ll be OK. I promise. Richard
points to a small island about a mile away.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Who are you people? Richard lets Margaret
wonder.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: So you must be Margaret. We’ve heard a lot
about you. All of it bad. Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in
her none to practical sling backs. GEOFFREY I mean, I almost shit myself
when I heard he was marrying the devil woman.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I thought it was the dragon lady?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Either way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey dad. Richard shakes his father’s hand.
It’s a little stiff.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Welcome home. Good to see ’ya.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Been a while.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. You’d think you could make it to the
airport to mark the occasion. Grandma Annie interrupts.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
Let’s get you two settled. As Richard and Margaret move towards the
house, Annie shoots Geoffrey a look that says “be nice”.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We’ll show you around later.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Balzac! Down! No! Debbie pulls the dog off
of Margaret and pushes him toward the kitchen. Margaret tries to take it
in stride and make small talk.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What a great name. Balzac’s “Lost
Illusions” is one of my favorite novels.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh. Well, this Balzac’s got epididymitis.
Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to illustrate how
Balzac really got his name. Not understanding, Margaret looks over at
Balzac as he walks away. Off her shocked reaction, we understand right
away that this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel. DEBBIE No one on the
island wanted him when he was born. We figured he deserved a home.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: And don’t let him outside, or the eagles
will snatch him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: C’mon dad…</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I mean it. They come out of that
rehabilitation center mean. And hungry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t listen to him, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’ll be sleeping here.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the
armoire by the bed. Just let me know if you</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Thank you. Where’s Richard’s room?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh, we took down his “shrine” years ago. And
don’t worry, I’m under no illusion that you two haven’t slept in the
same bed before. Richard can sleep here too.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, let’s not upset Grandma Annie.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It was her idea. Anything to help get her a
great grandchild. Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Great. You know, I’ve gotten used to his
breathing at night.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts
the door. Margaret reverts back to her old self.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m about 15 seconds from bitch.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hell if I know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You had no idea they knew about us getting
married?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You think I’d bring you here if I did?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, we just gotta tell ’em.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Tell ’em what?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Tell ’em the truth. About us.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Wrong answer. No way.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What do you mean no way? This is
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, crazy was lying to the federal
officer.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well I’m not making my Gammy an accomplice
to a Class C felony! For one second could you not be so selfish?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Selfish?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
only worry about yourself every second of every day?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How is it selfish to tell the truth?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Look. We’re awful, awful people. In the
last forty eight hours, we’ve lied to… everyone. We need to protect the
people downstairs. We can’t ask these good, decent, not awful people to
lie for us. Let’s keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a
second to make up her mind.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fine. But if we do this, you need to stop
lying to me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What’ve I lied to you about?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why did you tell me that you were
poor?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I never said that.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, you never told me you were rich.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When does that come up?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I don’t know, how about, “Hi, my name is
Richard, I’m an Alaskan titan of industry.”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well, maybe I didn’t tell you because you
would have fired me if you knew.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on! You’re always yammering on about
your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer
scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
working in the kitchen. You’re totally anti- rich.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not anti-rich.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh yes you are! And you know what makes it
worse? You have money!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I earned…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: …every penny I have. Blah, blah, blah. You
need new material.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey. Watch it. You’re still my
assistant.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You were going to promote me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nope. Not at all. Margaret takes a look at
herself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, come on. If we’re going to do this,
we might as well put on a show.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I went to Union college in upstate New
York. It’s a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of.
Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink. MARGARET
Lime?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Be right back. Richard leaves to fetch lime
wedges. Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, “What was that?”</p>
<p><strong>well wisher #1</strong>: How long have you been with your
company?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Since I graduated college. Richard comes
back with the lime. Margaret takes it and doesn’t say thank you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She’s been there since she was
nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Nineteen? Wow. That’s how long?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, who’s counting… Geoffrey could let it
go, but wants to push her.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: No. How many years is that? Exactly.
Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, let me see. That would be sixteen or
seventeen years. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I was never good with big numbers. That
makes you… thirty six now?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Just turned thirty seven. Born on May
20th. I’m a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
MARGARET I need some protein.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There’s some salmon. Margaret shakes her
head no. RICHARD Crab? Margaret nods yes. Richard steps away to find a
waiter. Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret’s bidding.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Keep him on a short leash, huh? Does he
roll over when you whistle? Debbie hits Geoffrey.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He’s just being a good host. Richard comes
right back with a waiter in tow. For Geoffrey’s benefit, Margaret makes
a point to thank Richard.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Thank you, honey. You’re being so sweet.
Richard is surprised, but remembers they’re a couple.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh, sure. Honey.</p>
<p><strong>well wisher #2</strong>: So you just got some big
promotion?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly
puts his arm around Margaret.</p>
<p>****: I’m so proud of my girl.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Editor in chief? You’re marrying up, Richard.
Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN . She is Grace Kelly in
Patagonia and Timberland. Adding insult to injury, she doesn’t have
eyeliner on.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Gert!? Richard snaps his arm back, hitting
Margaret in the head, and spilling her tonic water on her shirt. He
doesn’t notice what he’s done, and leaves Margaret. She’s peeved.
RICHARD</p>
<p>****: What are you? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Your dad made me come.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: From Chicago? Gertrude laughs. The group
watches these two see each for the first time in years. There is instant
chemistry, and Richard has forgotten about Margaret completely.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: No. I live here now.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I moved back about six months ago. I’m
teaching second grade. At Baranof.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Did your husband move up here too?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Uh, no. I, ah, got divorced.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh my God. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Me too. But hey, we’re being rude, I wanna
meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re a Gertrude?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: A family name from hell.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sure it’s been a curse.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Gert and Richard were quite the item in
high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey’s reminiscence.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Oh Please. Ancient history.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Feels like yesterday to me.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: So tell me everything. I hear it wasn’t
exactly love at first sight?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Now Richard, what I want to know is
how you proposed. This grabs the group’s full attention. Everyone loves
to hear a story like this.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well… Richard hasn’t recovered from seeing
Gertrude. RICHARD Uh, uh, um, I…</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Yeah. How did you pop the question?
Richard is a deer in the headlights. This is getting ugly. Margaret sees
that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Can I tell this one, honey?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m an early, early riser and go for a run
everyday. Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my
normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage,
wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run? Richard! So I
ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his
finger to his lips and says, “shhhh.” So there I am in my jogging
clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him
in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear. Couple
minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green. Best part, we’re the
only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early.
Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek
above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says “I
didn’t want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are
the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world
if you would be my wife. Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?” The
group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET I said yes. The
group gives a collective “ahh”. Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and
Richard by the hand.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: You are a good boy Richard, and you
make me very proud. I love you Richy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the
couple. Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: So did this happen before or after the INS
agent came sniffing around?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What is wrong with you? I’m sorry Margaret.
Margaret doesn’t miss a beat.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh please. I’d wonder too. Honestly, my
lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the
airport it was the first time I’d heard about it. I’m so
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Don’t be, dear. Geoffrey’s just an ass.
While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says
“I’ve got this under control”. The moment is interrupted when Richard
pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE. He takes a step back and answers quietly
so no one can hear.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Margaret Mill’s phone. One second please.
Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. RICHARD
It’s our friend, Frank. Richard’s tone let’s Margaret know there’s a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Excuse me, I’ll just be a second. Margaret
takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the
backyard. She leaves the door open, and doesn’t notice Balzac follow her
outside.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Don’t be a cliche, Frank. Don’t be the
wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret
notices Balzac, but ignores him. The dog starts YAPPING to get
attention. She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she
gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her
chest so Frank doesn’t hear. MARGARET Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and
pouts. Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear.</p>
<p>****: Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the
eagle has resumed flying in circles above her. She decides to wrap up
the call quick and get back to the house. MARGARET Frank, I don’t want
to sell you on anything. But know this. This book is your legacy…
Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.
She runs. MARGARET … and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
tomorrow-with-your-decision. My-phone is- always-on. Talk-to-you-soon.
The eagle bears down on them with talons out. Just as the eagle is about
to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the
eagle. To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret’s phone and flies off.
Margaret freaks. MARGARET</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Where’s Margaret? We need to go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s a surprise. Girls are going into town.
And the boys stay here. I told you, we’ve planned everything.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Um. She’s outside. Debbie and Richard turn
around and look out a picture window. They see Margaret running with
Balzac above her head.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh that’s sweet, she’s playing with my
Balzac.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle. C’mon,
bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The eagle took my phone!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Your dad was right! The eagle tried to
take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Did the dingo eat your baby, too?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Frank’s going to call me on that phone. I
need it!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Relax. I’ve got your information backed up
on the laptop. I’ll just get you a new phone and switch the number. No
problem.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now come on. You’re going somewhere with my
mom and the girls.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You want a new phone? You’re going.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Work it Hank!</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Is that a salmon down your pants? The room
laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from Margaret’s face.
Margaret remains straight faced.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Definitely not a salmon. The women
encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret’s hands to his wiggling ass and
gives her a feel. She can’t help but give and embarrassed smile.
Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits. Thrilled, the room
gives him a standing ovation. Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss
on the cheek. She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Ah, ah, ah. I was just the warm up. Hank sits
Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Just sit there dear.</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Don’t be shy ladies, tip well and often, show
Hank how much you appreciate his assets! And now… Ramone! The room goes
silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the stage. He has a pot
belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache. Ramone’s dance has a Latin
theme to it, and he’s very good at it. Margaret is oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s that smell? Margaret finally takes
off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face.
MARGARET Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream
frightens Ramone. After the initial scare he composes himself and wags
his finger at her naughty behavior.</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: You are a naughty devil. Ramone goes to work
another part of the stage, and when he turns, Margaret jumps off the
stage and joins the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Good lord.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Ramone was the only male dancer on
the island for years. No one has the heart to tell him to hang it
up.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Want me to do it?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Thank you dear, but let’s keep it our
secret.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: …yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
dissolve in the water.</p>
<p><strong>maguire</strong>: How does she come up with this shit?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: She just does. I stopped trying to figure
out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.
Mr. Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.</p>
<p>****: I’m mad at you, son!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why’s that, Mr. Maguire?</p>
<p><strong>maguire</strong>: You fly up here and don’t call me?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>maguire</strong>: What good is me owning an airline if I
can’t give you free tickets?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re right. Don’t know what I was
thinking…</p>
<p><strong>maguire</strong>: Damn, straight. Don’t let it happen again!
Here, you take over. This game is for pussies, I’m getting a drink.
Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with one
another for the first time. Things are awkward between father and son,
and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid conversation. Geoffrey finally
makes small talk.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Maguire’s stepping down in January. He’s,
uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look. He knows
where this is going.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s great for them.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: So. How’s work with you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Good. Busy. You know.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I do. I do. Hey, did I tell you that we’re
opening a little office in Japan?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: We’re not just a mom and pop operation
anymore. We’re going global.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls
for a second. He’s been thinking about this moment for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I could really use your help.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Dad. Please. I’m in New York. Margaret’s in
New York. We have jobs.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I know. I know. It’s just…</p>
<p>****: It’s just what?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: You’re only a secretary. This pisses
Richard off immediately.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Again with the secretary thing! I’ve told
you, I’m an assistant!</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Just because you call yourself an
“assistant” doesn’t mean you’re not really just a secretary.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well if I’m “just a secretary”, why would
you want me up here anyway? Sounds like you’re doing great without
me.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: It’s not like that and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Then how is it? Explain it to me. Geoffrey
looks around to see if anyone is listening.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
butt…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This man was a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: …and it got me thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m not sure this is coming out right.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Just shut up for a second, okay? I want
you to have what I built. But I’m running out of time to show you
things.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Stop being so dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I’m not being… I need you to stop dicking
around down there and get serious.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So this is all about what you want?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: That’s not what I said.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And me in New York with Margaret? That
isn’t serious?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: One day the woman is the Antichrist, and
the next day she’s the love of your life? How is that serious?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Things change, dad.</p>
<p>****: Things change?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Things change.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Things change?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes. Things change.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Things change. That’s your explanation?
Know what I think? I think you banged your boss and fell in love, that’s
what I think. Some sorta mommy complex.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nice, dad. We gotta have these Cosby
moments more often. This is great. Richard drops his club and walks back
to the house.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: They can be a little overwhelming, but
they’re great people.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What? I’m just working on my tan. It’s
been a long day. Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still
raging.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Around the solstice they don’t watch the
clock. Pretty much party ’til they fall over.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I actually missed it when I was in the
states.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Chicago, right?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Yeah. Since college.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And now you’re back?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Six months now. Call me crazy, but I love
it. Think I’m back for good.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Really? I don’t know. Don’t you miss…</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Neimans? Starbucks? Escalators? Margaret
laughs. She likes this woman. GERTRUDE Yeah. I miss it. Believe me,
growing up I never thought I’d end up divorced and back here teaching at
my old elementary school. That was always Richard’s plan.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: For you to get divorced?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: No. I was going to teach, he was going to
run his dad’s business. He was like a little old man. Had it all worked
out.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Are we talking about the same guy?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well, Richard’s such a player. Gertrude
looks confused. MARGARET I mean he was a total player. Before we started
dating. Six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That surprises you?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Did he ever tell you why we broke up?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We don’t really talk much about stuff like
that.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Oh. Well I should shut up…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No, no. Please. I mean, we are getting
married. I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: He proposed to me. When we were seniors.
Margaret laughs.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to… He proposed
to you in high school?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: He bought this sweet little ring, and got
down on his knee. It was so cute.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You must have…</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: … freaked out? Oh you bet. I broke up with
him on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I would hope so.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: After getting rejected the first time, I
can’t imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you.
Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being
so honest with her. GERTRUDE Anyway. The idea that my little old man
could be a player… It’s just not the Richard I knew. Good thing you’re
making an honest man of him again.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ll be right in. Margaret smiles and
turns to the ocean. Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret
silently whispers. MARGARET We are awful people.</p>
<p>****: Richard! Honey! Is everything OK? With his back to the girls
and the iPod on, Richard doesn’t hear or see the girls. Annie shakes her
head. Something is up.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Excuse me? I’m watching that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why is Richard chopping wood?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And don’t play dumb. What did you do?
Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Nothing. I didn’t do anything… will you
please move. The showdown intensifies. Margaret excuses herself.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears
Margaret’s voice. He’s still mad. Margaret just smiles. MARGARET Think
I’m going to take a shower and clean off Ramone’s bubble gum body oil.
Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her
good night. Once she’s gone, they turn their death stare back to
Geoffrey. He looks genuinely unnerved.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Stop looking at me like that!</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Margaret turns off the shower,
pulls back the curtain and reaches for a towel. All she finds is a
miniature unabsorbent decorative hand towel. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: Richard enters the room smiling as
Charlene sings “…I’ve been undressed by kings and I’ve seen some things
that a woman ain’t</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Margaret’s ears perk up. The
bathroom is a disaster because she has dripped water everywhere looking
for a towel.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Richard, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: Richard opens the armoire next to
the bed and pulls out an incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Margaret cracks the door open to
see what the sound was. Richard isn’t there, but she sees the armoire
open and the towels waiting for her. How did she miss that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Richard, are you… Then out of nowhere,
Balzac startles Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>balzac</strong>: Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! Margaret slips on
the wet floor and falls on her ass. Her foot kicks the door open as she
retreats from the vengeful puppy.</p>
<p><strong>on the bedroom’s deck</strong>: Richard is oblivious as he
hangs his wet clothes over a rail on the deck attached to the room. He
makes sure that no one is in the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs
them up as well.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Naked, wet, and starting to get a
little pissed off, Margaret manages to pull herself up by the toilet.
She wants a towel badly, but Balzac guards the doorway. She tries
reason.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry bout the eagle. But I saved you.
Balzac won’t listen to reason and barks angrily. Margaret grabs the
ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.</p>
<p><strong>on the bedroom deck</strong>: Richard calmly turns around and
sees that the bathroom door is open. That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Margaret holds the top of the
toilet tank like a baseball bat, ready to strike. Balzac will not be
intimidated, and continues to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.
Margaret knows that she can’t hit a dog, and looks for another way out.
Then she spots the bathroom mat.</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: Richard saunters towards the
bathroom, wearing only his iPod.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom</strong>: Balzac puts a paw onto the bath
mat. Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top. Balzac gets to the center
of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls hard, sliding the bath mat and
Balzac to the back of the bathroom. With Balzac out of the way, she runs
out, closes the door behind her and…</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: WHAM! Margaret crashes into Richard
and they fall to the floor. It takes a second for them to realize that
they are holding each other buck naked.</p>
<p><strong>margaret richard</strong>: Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The two quickly separate and spastically
try to cover up. A rapid fire back and forth ensues.</p>
<p><strong>margaret richard</strong>: Why are you naked? Why are you
wet?</p>
<p><strong>margaret richard</strong>: Don’t look at me! You tackled
me!</p>
<p><strong>margaret richard</strong>: It was the dog! You’re blaming the
dog again?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Will you just hand me a towel! Richard
looks for a towel, but forgets he’s naked. When he looks under the bed,
Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes.. MARGARET You’re flashing brain!
Richard quickly changes positions. Out of desperation, he pulls the
entire comforter off the bed. He throws it Margaret’s way, and she wraps
herself in it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I didn’t know you were home! I was outside
chopping wood!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You didn’t hear me?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I had my iPod on!</p>
<p>****: Why did you jump me? Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on
his shorts.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I didn’t jump you. I didn’t mean to jump
you. I didn’t know you were here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You didn’t see me?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I was running from the dog! Richard looks
at Margaret suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Wait. Were you tryin’ to seduce me?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh please! Don’t flatter yourself.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Mmm-Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Go take a shower. You stink.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fine. But don’t come sneaking in there.
You’re still my boss. That’d be sexual harassment.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and
blankets he can find to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with the
sun still shining outside. She gets into her bed.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m never gonna to get to sleep. Richard
pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window.
The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black.
MARGARET Oh. Well. Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for
a bed. The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It was kinda weird seeing you naked.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Can we not talk about this?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m just saying. It was weird.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It wasn’t weird.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How was that not weird?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Because we’re… like teammates.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’re like teammates?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We are teammates. And teammates see each
other naked in the locker room. All the time. It’s not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well, if we’re teammates can I sleep in the
bed?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in
silence for another beat.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Margaret?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t take this the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re a very beautiful woman. Margaret
smiles with her head turned away from Richard.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Get some sleep Richard, big day
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Yes. Mr. Gilbertson? My name is Geoffrey
Paxton… Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey’s office hear the
rest of the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s me dear. I made you two breakfast in
bed. Can I come in?</p>
<p>****: Uh, sure. Just a second. Margaret can’t yell at Richard, so she
throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up. She hits him in the
head.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What the…</p>
<p>****: Your mother. Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides
signs of his makeshift bed. He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and
puts his arm around Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray
of pastries, fruit and coffee. RICHARD Ah mom, you made your cinnamon
rolls.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Well, it’s your special day. Debbie smiles,
puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed.
She is buzzing with excitement. DEBBIE You two need your energy, so eat
up. We’ve got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then
your wedding.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
phone.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Will you pick up some champagne while you’re
there?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And don’t be gone for too long. Lots of work
to be done!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You don’t have to go to all this trouble.
Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Don’t be silly. This is the biggest day of
your life. You are coming into this family, and when it’s family, it’s
no trouble. If your parents were with us, they would do the exact same.
Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes. Richard jumps out
of bed and goes to the food.</p>
<p>****: Your mom is just so sweet. I haven’t had someone make me
breakfast in bed since I was a little kid. Richard takes a huge bite of
cinnamon roll.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I wish she hadn’t. I mean she almost caught
us. Damn, that was close. Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig
in and doesn’t pay attention to Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You just take all this for granted? Your
family, this house… Richard takes another big bite and turns to
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry, what? You gotta try these.
Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why are you doing this to them?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why am I here? You didn’t have to bring me
here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You made me bring you here! You told me
I</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I didn’t make you do anything. You could
of said no.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And what? Start over at the bottom again?
No way.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I get why a not rich person would do this.
But you’ve got everything. It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Know what? This is none of your
business.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I wish it wasn’t my business. But
unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with
someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.
He’s exasperated.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You wanna know why you’re here? I’ll show
you why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We leave in a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret
angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate.
She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes. A beat passes, and she
comes back to the rolls. MARGARET These are really good. She takes a
cinnamon roll and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>bek bek</strong>: Hey, Richard! That the lucky lady?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes sir, it is!</p>
<p><strong>bek bek</strong>: You look much younger than everyone
says.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That’s great to hear.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: See ya on the line, Bek Bek.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Put this on. I’ll meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: But I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ah. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Is this really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’ll thank me later. Richard walks
towards the warehouse. Margaret follows in her</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why is he handcuffed to the machine?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So his hands don’t go too far. So he
doesn’t… Richard makes a chopping motion. Margaret winces.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed
into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are
pulled out. MARGARET You know, I shouldn’t be here. I was a vegetarian
for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime
line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning
before they are frozen. With great speed, they take the fish from the
gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: There he is! Big city boy come to show us
how its done.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ah, it’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: C’mon. Show her how we do it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the
end of the line. Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife. RICHARD You
grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don’t want to bruise it. Open her
up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish. Two quick
stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes
the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much
distance as possible between her and the salmon.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I did this for five summers. Dad wanted me
to earn my stripes before I took over.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Is that why you’re still pissed at
him?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nah, I loved it here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You loved this?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The slime line? Hell no. Nobody loves the
slime line. I loved this place. The people. Growing up, running this
place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a
fish.</p>
<p>****: You wanted this?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I wanted to run this place. It was
comfortable here. It was what I knew. Don’t forget the spine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I wasn’t gonna forget. Margaret squeezes
the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another
fish with more confidence.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But then things changed. And it wasn’t so
comfortable anymore.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What kind of things changed?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Stuff.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You mean, like, Gertrude?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah… Richard stops, he can tell Margaret
knows something. RICHARD Oh my god. She told you didn’t she?</p>
<p>****: Told me what? Richard is embarrassed. He turns away.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: About the… you know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The creepy teenage proposal?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ah, shit!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You were a freak by the way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, get it all out.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And she was right to break up with
you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You done? Margaret nods yes.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: For a little while? Don’t sell yourself
short.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When Gert crushed my heart into little
pieces, a life up here didn’t seem so great anymore.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So you moved to the open arms of New York
City?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: At first it was about getting as far away
from this place as possible, but then I fell in love with it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: With scheduling my pilates?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: With editing. See, as an only kid I’d
always read a lot, but until I worked for you I didn’t love it. I mean,
when I realized that we could find the next Cuckoo’s Nest, or Catch 22,
or…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: …To Kill a Mockingbird. It’s all about To
Kill a Mockingbird.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Exactly! We could find the next To Kill a
Mockingbird. God damn, how great is that? Margaret smiles. She never
knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job. RICHARD So when
I tell my folks that I want to spend my life finding books? My dad goes
ape shit. “How dare you forsake your family… you’ll come crawling back
to us… you’re nothing without our help.” I left that night and we didn’t
talk for a year. Haven’t been back here since.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So we’re “getting married” so you can give
daddy the finger?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving
look. RICHARD Sorta. OK, Yes. Coming back here with you… I get the
promotion and I get to show off. You’re editor in chief. You make a good
prop.</p>
<p>****: I guess that’s a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So now you know I’m a petty asshole. Am I
trustworthy again?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh yeah, we’re good. By the way, you’re
more screwed up than I am, Paxton.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: One more question…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, everyone at work thinks you’re a
lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That wasn’t my question.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I know. Just lashing out. Margaret
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Can we stop gutting fish? I need my
phone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey Ramone.</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: Hey Richard. Hola mi amo. Margaret
recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.</p>
<p>****: Hey. They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
MARGARET You know him?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He was my shop teacher.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Of course he was. How many people are on
this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Like eight thousand? Depends on the time of
the year.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Feels smaller. With the cart full they
head to the checkout.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You got the phone I called about?</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
Ramone throws Richard a phone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks, Ramone.</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty
wave. She awkwardly waves back. Richard pushes the cart out the front
door and does not pay. Margaret is confused.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why’s Ramone letting you steal his
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s our stuff.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That must have been handy in High
School.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Should you leave the cart?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s our cart. I didn’t know you were such
a prude.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ve come to realize that being my
assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but
there are a few things you don’t know about me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I doubt it. When I started, you were still
wearing those Ugg boot things.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I told you never to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m just saying it’s been a long time. I
know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone. It searches for a
signal.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Did you know I took disco lessons in the
sixth grade?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The Y.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Margaret 1, Richard 0.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh, my first concert was Kool and the
Gang.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: At Woodstock?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
the fair.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What’d they sing again?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You know.</p>
<p>****: Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live…
Richard shakes his head. MARGARET Well they were good.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You had a lot of soul there, Canada.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I really like “The O.C.”. Not fake, ha, ha
isn’t it funny I like this trash. I really like it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Wow. I’m getting shut out here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Allergic to pine nuts.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Knew that.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Afraid of penguins.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Haven’t slept with a man in a year and a
half.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Holy shit! You are a lesbian! A MOTHER
walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty look. RICHARD My
bad. The mother walks on. Margaret is mortified and walks faster.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
gets a Holy shit? I’ve been busy!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s a really long time.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That hurts coming from Mr. Magic
Pants.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I knew it had been slow going, but I
figured there was a booty call in there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m not good at that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No, not that. I’m great at that. Aces. Top
notch.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll have to take your word for it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes. You will.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How, exactly, do you define top notch?
Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone. In an
instant, she’s all business.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I need a computer and the internet.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>pirate</strong>: Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas. Our
T-1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a hurricane, but for now ye be
needing to scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet. Margaret looks and
sees that all the computers are taken.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No, no, no. I need on now. I’ve got a
Booker prize winning author demanding I send him an e-mail in the next
forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house
that “makes” him do publicity. The Pirate looks at Margaret like she’s
speaking Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>pirate</strong>: Arrgh…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Listen to me asshole… The Pirate looks
around to make sure his boss can’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>pirate</strong>: Look lady. You gonna put your name down on
the list or not? Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard
pulls her back.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: C’mon. I got an idea. Richard leads
Margaret to the door. As they are leaving Margaret shouts out.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I didn’t know there were a lot of pirates
in Alaska!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whiting</strong>: I’m so excited about the wedding!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks for letting us use your
computer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whiting</strong>: No problem. So what flowers are you
going with? Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her
cool.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry, but could I have a minute
alone</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whiting</strong>: Oh. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting? It’s
been years.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whiting</strong>: Do you think she’ll be long? I’ve got
work to do.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She’ll be out of there in two shakes. Out
of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of
second graders. He stops transfixed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whiting</strong>: We are so lucky to have her.
Mr. Megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of
the school year. He’s living out in the forest now with his wolves. Full
time. Richard hasn’t heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said. He’s
hypnotized by Gertrude. She looks happy teaching these kids, and they
hang on her every word. MRS. WHITING Will you excuse me? The bell is
about to ring, I need to get ready for recess.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves. Richard goes
to the door and Gertrude sees him. Good lord can that woman smile. She
waves him in.</p>
<p><strong>inside the classroom</strong>: The kids all turn to see
Richard when he opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Class, this is my old friend Richard.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Hi Richard!</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Richard and I used to be in this very same
classroom together. We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher.</p>
<p><strong>child #1</strong>: Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs! The
class giggles.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: That’s not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
The BELL RINGS. One girl gets up. Gertrude eyeballs her. GERTRUDE
Marcia?</p>
<p><strong>child #2</strong>: Sorry. The child sits back down. Gertrude
waits a beat.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: OK, everyone is excused for recess. All
the kids pop up and head to the door. Mrs. Whiting directs traffic
outside. Richard makes his way to Gertrude.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Patrick’s right. He did smell like
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: It’s still not a nice thing to say. And
actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and… …Matanuska Thunderfuck.
But let’s keep that between us.</p>
<p>****: I give you my word as an editor and a friend… The door opens
suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS. MARGARET</p>
<p>****: Five more minutes! Please!</p>
<p>****: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this
after school for a week?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: That was your fault.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Was not!</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: You tried to kiss me. A girl has to defend
herself.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: C’mon! I had the shot. I took it. Gertrude
rolls her eyes. She’s heard this a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: No Top Gun. Please.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What? You loved my Top Gun.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: No. You loved your Top Gun. I just smiled
and laughed like a good girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s right. Ice… man. I am dangerous.
Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Gertrude
is not impressed.</p>
<p>****: Really. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That cuts deep. I’ll have you know that</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: No. Nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s been awhile, but I can still tell when
something’s wrong with you. Gertrude doesn’t want to say anything.
RICHARD What is it? You know I hate it when you get all quiet.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I wish there was a better way to say
this.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Better way to say what?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I made a huge mistake. With you. Breaking
up with you. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are you apologizing for high school?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, thank God. I thought this was like,
something big.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: This is something big.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I coulda used this about five years ago,
but I’m all good now, promise. Thank you for saying that, though.
Gertrude sees that Richard isn’t getting her point. She pulls herself
together.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I think… I want you back.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Oh God, he’s making me say it again. I
want you back. Like… we should be together. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I know this isn’t the best time to bring
this up.</p>
<p>****: My wedding day isn’t the best time for you to bring up the idea
of us dating? Richard’s reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
Bringing this up is very hard for her.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I’m not talking about dating! You should
move back here. We can have the life you always talked about in High
School. I’m ready for that now.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I know that the timing here sucks. But we
are meant to be together. I know it. I think you know it too…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I don’t. I don’t know it. Richard
begins to pace. Not sure what to say. Every time he opens his mouth, he
can’t find the words. Then, from the door, an interruption.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey guys. Holy shit. Did Margaret hear
anything? Her face gives nothing away. Gertrude and Richard act like
nothing just happened, but look guilty as hell.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Oh. Hey Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh, you all done?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. We’ll see what he says.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Great. Great.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You ready to get back to the house?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh. Yeah. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well let’s go. See you at the wedding,
Gertrude. Gertrude just smiles.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Yeah. See you at the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
Richard lies.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nothing. About her school. The kids and
stuff. Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That was it? I was gone for awhile…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. That was it. You know, I can do this.
You should really go try on the dress for my mom.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I was going to go for a run first, it’s
been three days since I got out, I’m feeling crazy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Whatever. Margaret isn’t accustomed to
Richard talking to her this way, but doesn’t push it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and
hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT. She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by
the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it. He is dressed in a loin
cloth, and wears a carved bear’s head mask and tribal make up. His belly
shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
that sounds centuries old.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: Yai…takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance. He
begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath. He yells out again. SHAMAN
Margaret, welcome! She looks around. Maybe another Margaret is in the
vicinity. SHAMAN Come to me, Margaret of New York. Nope, that’s her. She
carefully steps out into the clearing. SHAMAN It is I, father Paxton.
Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What, ah, are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: My shaman Kevin told me to get out here
and clear my head. As you know, things have been a little crazy around
here. You should join me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Ya know, I’ve got to get back.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: You closed minded southerners amuse me.
Never willing to leave the nest and try</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws
sand into the fire and it blazes higher.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Dance with me! You besmirch my ways if you
deny my circle. Worried she’s going to really piss him off, Margaret
relents.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: OK, OK. I “accept your circle.” Geoffrey
smiles and throws more sand into the fire.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey
begins dancing slowly, contorting his body. Margaret follows, always a
half step behind, and can’t get into it. After a few moments, Margaret
stops.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m gonna head back.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: We’re not done.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I think I am. Margaret begins to leave.
Geoffrey calls after her.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around.
GEOFFREY I’m sorry we got off on the wrong foot. But I’m making an
effort here. Don’t leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.
Geoffrey is pleased. GEOFFREY Thank you. Yai…takuju magaluam Ut uksu
lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k… Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to
make it go higher and speeds up the dance. Margaret is getting better,
but it is still painfully awkward.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Me what?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Chant.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Chant what?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Whatever comes out, just chant. It is the
way. You’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Close your eyes. Chant. Margaret and
Geoffrey keep dancing. Margaret closes her eyes, but can’t figure out
what to say. GEOFFREY Chant!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I don’t know any chants!</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Chant!</p>
<p>****: Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo… Looking at Margaret,
it’s surprising she can make such a low noise. MARGARET
…ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo…</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Chant! The drum beat continues.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Geoffrey! Margaret stops chanting ’Lil
John.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Oh Debbie, I didn’t do anything. Margaret
sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Is she singing about balls?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He told me I had to chant!</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Oh, you poor dear. Geoffrey, you
can’t do this! He’s an eighth Tlingit, dear.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He does this to keep in touch with “his
people”.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Don’t make fun of my heritage! And it was
helping. Don’t you feel better? I feel better.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
up. You’ve got a dress to try on. And Geoffrey, put that fire out and
come in and help us with this wedding. Geoffrey turns off the boom box
that was hidden in the trees and the drum beat stops.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Fine. With a fire extinguisher, the
bonfire comes to an end.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I am so excited. Aren’t you excited?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: This was my dress from 1929. My
mother made it by hand. Amazing how things come back into style. How
does it fit? Margaret speaks through the door.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Just buttoning up here.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Drum roll! Grandma and Debbie
enthusiastically make drum roll sounds. Margaret opens the door and
smiles. She’s unsure of herself, but looks fantastic. The dress fits
great, except… GRANDMA ANNIE Your boobs are bigger than mine ever
were.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah, it’s a little snug.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come over here. Debbie leads Margaret to a
mirror. Grandma Annie follows.</p>
<p>****: It’s a lovely dress. Debbie looks at Margaret, and
spontaneously begins crying.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’re so beautiful, and such a great match
for my Richard. I know I’ve just met you, but a mother can tell. When he
looks at you, I can tell he’s in love. I’m so happy I get to share your
day.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Debbie, please. We’ve got work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’re right. Debbie collects herself, then
starts crying again.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: You go work downstairs, I’ll finish
this. Debbie tries to calm down, but can’t. GRANDMA ANNIE Go! Debbie
nods in agreement. Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in tears.
Margaret and Annie watch her go. GRANDMA ANNIE Had to get rid of her
before I gave you this. Don’t think she woulda recovered. Grandma Annie
comes from behind and puts her arms around Margaret’s neck. When she is
done, a stunning blue necklace lays on Margaret’s neck. GRANDMA ANNIE
You needed something blue. It’s silly, but I didn’t want to take any
chances.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: It’s hematite. Alaska diamonds. The
blue ones like this are very rare. My great grandfather gave it to my
great grandmother when they were married. They were quite a scandal, you
know. He was Russian and she was Tlingit.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How’d they stay together?</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Don’t know. But I’m sure happy they
did, none of us would be here if they hadn’t. Grandma and Margaret
admire the necklace in the mirror. GRANDMA ANNIE I want you to have it.
This is awful news for Margaret. She might as well be stealing from
Annie.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No, no, no. I can’t. Really.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: I don’t want to hear it. It’s yours.
Grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren. Makes
us feel like we’ll always be a part of your life, even after we’re gone.
Take it. Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
feels like a complete and total fraud. GRANDMA ANNIE Are you feeling all
right, dear? Margaret doesn’t speak. Annie patiently waits for her
reply.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well. Thing is… Margaret deliberates
spilling her guts to Annie, but can’t. MARGARET …the dress is just a
little tight.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about that. We’ve got
these seams by the arm, this’ll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with
tailor’s chalk. GRANDMA ANNIE We can fix this no problem. Margaret
smiles, but knows that Annie couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m a little busy.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well I’m freaking out. I need to get away
from here. From everyone. Now.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Go for another run.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No! I did that. It did not help.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m a little tired of you making demands
and me just jumping…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We’re not going to need any of this if I
don’t get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, high maintenance. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Move over, I’m driving. Margaret cuts in
front of Richard and grabs the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You don’t know where we’re going. Margaret
opens up the throttle and they are off.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>on the open ocean</strong>: Margaret and Richard leave
everyone behind and take off for the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The north pole. Congratulations, we made
it. It’s a glacier. Tracy’s Arm. You better let me take it from
here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh. OK. So like me, you’ve navigated a lot
of glacier fields? And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and
lets Richard steer. RICHARD Lady, you’ve got issues.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. I’m a control freak. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: This coming from the sociopath.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’d never bring me here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You drove!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I mean to Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to
the glacier and turns off the engine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re sick. Doing this to them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I explained to you…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They love you. Do you get that?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And you’re still willing to lie to
them?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Like you didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Didn’t know what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That we were going to lie to them.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I didn’t know!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well that makes you either stupid, or
ignorant.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You think I’m stupid?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, but what’s behind door number two…</p>
<p>****: I forgot! OK? I forgot!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Forgot what?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What it was like!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What what was like?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: To have a family! I forgot what it was
like to have a family. I’ve been on my own since I was thirteen, and I’d
forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you
breakfast, and give you necklaces…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We need to head back…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Alone. I need alone time.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What? Margaret looks at Richard with a
scared and confused look.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m, uh, about to lose my shit. Big time.
I need a second.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But…</p>
<p>****: Stop right there! Richard puts up his hands in surrender and
stays put. MARGARET I’m going to be over there. Away from you. Just sit
down, turn around, and act like you’re not here. Richard goes to speak,
but Margaret motions for him to sit down and turn around. He does.
Margaret gets off the boat and walks away from him on the glacier.</p>
<p><strong>on the glacier</strong>: Margaret tries diaphragmatic
breathing to calm down. MARGARET You can do this. Couple more hours, and
then you’ll never see these people again. Eventually you’ll write a
letter. Apologize. Send the necklace back.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Margaret!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No talking!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Watch your step, OK? It can be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Again, you’re not supposed to be… Margaret
doesn’t finish her sentence.</p>
<p><strong>on the boat</strong>: Richard sits with his back turned to
Margaret, waiting for her reply. He doesn’t hear anything. That’s
weird.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Margaret? Richard turns around and looks
for Margaret. He doesn’t see her. He gets out of the boat and goes onto
the glacier, walking in the direction he last saw Margaret. RICHARD
Margaret? I know I’m breaking “the rules” here, but where are you? He
takes one more step before he hears…</p>
<p>****: Richard!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!! Richard still can’t see her, but
runs in the direction of her voice. He soon rounds a mound of ice and
sees that – Margaret’s been swallowed by the ice. Her upper torso sticks
out of the glacier, held up by her arms. Her eyes are wide, and she’s
almost hyperventilating. It’s a bizarre sight. MARGARET Oh, thank God!
Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Margaret is
really scared. MARGARET Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Just relax. I’ll get
you out of there. You’ve broken through an ice bridge. It happens all
the time. No biggie.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t do what?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The thing that doctors do in E.R. when
they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they’re going
to be OK. Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s not like that. Really. We do need to
be careful here though, I don’t want us both to fall in. Stay still,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from
Margaret now. He’s checking the ice to see if it is stable. He slowly
walks her way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So, I’m going to walk up to you and very
slowly pull you out. OK?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m really cold.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, that’s normal when you’re surrounded
by ice.</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose
head just comes up to his knee. He calmly looks down on her.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So I’m going to pull you up by your
armpits. I’m probably going to touch boob. But don’t freak out. Margaret
shakes her head yes. Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of
the ice. Margaret doesn’t say a word. RICHARD When I get you all the way
out, I need you to hold onto me. I’m going to carry you over there.
Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard. He’s strong, so
it isn’t difficult for him to slowly carry her “over the threshold”
style, away from the hole in the ice. He speaks once they’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You said it was “no biggie”.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. Well. You OK?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine. Richard smiles. Margaret
smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms. She
fits just right. Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully. MARGARET</p>
<p>****: You shouldn’t of laughed at me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You woulda laughed at me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. While I was getting my camera. The
two stare at each other for a beat. There’s a real spark. They might
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Gertrude wants me back. Whoah. Not what she
was expecting. She looks down.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well. It seemed like you were having…
second thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. I was.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Maybe we should do it. Come clean.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down
near the boat. She tries to regain her composure. MARGARET You wanna
call it off?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If you do.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fine. It’s over. We’ll tell them when we
get back.</p>
<p><strong>on the boat</strong>: Margaret sits hunched over with a
blanket wrapped around her. Richard drives the boat. They don’t
talk.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where’s mom, dad? We all need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Not now. C’mon. Richard and Margaret look
at each other, not sure what to do. Geoffrey storms off and they
follow.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I haven’t told your mother about any of
this, and I don’t plan to. I was really beginning to like you. Sorry
about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>inside the guesthouse</strong>: The guesthouse has been
converted into a squash court. In the middle of the court, a man
patiently sits on a metal folding chair. It’s Gilbertson. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Hey there kids. Good to see ya!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What did you do? Geoffrey doesn’t answer.
He’s not proud of himself. RICHARD What did you do, dad?!</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I called him yesterday. He told me that
you were lying, and that he was going to catch you. That he was going to
send you to prison.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: We made a deal and dad here flew me
up. Now you tell the truth, and get off scott free. It’s like it never
happened for you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You made a deal with him? On my behalf?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: You were making a mistake…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The hell it is. It is not fine!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Oh quack, quack, quack. Just tell me
what really happened, and I’ll be on my way. No one gets hurt, we all
get what we want. Margaret takes Richard’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s OK. Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You do not get to make this decision. This
is my decision. The truth is… I’ve been working for Margaret for three
years. Six months ago we started dating. I recently asked her to marry
me, and she said yes. See you both at</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: What are you doing, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on, we gotta get ready. Margaret and
Richard storm out of the squash court.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What was I thinking? They act like they’re
nice, but really, they’re evil.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He’s only doing it because he loves
you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are you defending him? Are you defending
the king dick?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Just stop. Think about this.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, I’ve thought about it. And know what I
think? I think you saved my life. Thank you, Margaret. Getting married
to you is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Without this, I
might’ve ended up back here. Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: There you are! You two almost gave me a
heart attack. C’mon, get dressed!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Coming mom! Time to sack up. Richard winks
and goes inside. Margaret follows, not sure.</p>
<p><strong>the wedding montage</strong>: – Chairs are set up outside. –
Guests arrive via boat. – Richard stands on the deck, wearing his
tuxedo. Gertrude arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes. Richard
waves hello and mouths “Sorry.” He goes back inside.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: If I were one to brag, I’d say that
dress is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Matches the shoes. Margaret pulls up the
dress to reveal running sneakers.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Those’ll be your best friend. Wedding
shoes stink. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Nice song. Richard shrugs his
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: Is that your song, dear?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I guess so. Margaret and Annie stop at the
end of the aisle. Looking up, Margaret sees the justice of the peace,
Ramone.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: It’s me, Ramone. Margaret gives Annie
a kiss, and then turns to Richard. They whisper while they walk up to
Ramone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You look gorgeous.</p>
<p>****: You look disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So, is this what you dreamed of when you
were a little girl?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo,
where Ramone awaits. MARGARET Ramone.</p>
<p>****: Mi amo. We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life’s
greatest moments. To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
unselfish ways… Margaret looks at Richard on the word “unselfish,” but
he’s looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. RAMONE …of
Richard and Margaret’s true love… “True Love” gets Margaret as well,
although no one in the audience notices. RAMONE …before their family and
friends. “Family and Friends” gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
Geoffrey. She purses her lips. He holds on to his chair in order to keep
himself seated. RAMONE For it is family and friends who taught Richard
and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all
celebrate that love here today.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: Then why is your hand up?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I have something to say. It’s not a
question though.</p>
<p><strong>ramone</strong>: Can it wait ’til after?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh. Um. No.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What are you doing? Margaret gathers
herself and turns around to the crowd. They stare back, unsure what to
make of this foreigner.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey there, folks. Thanks for coming out.
I’ve got a little announcement to make about the “wedding.”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes
Richard’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Not sure the best way to tell you all
this. But, uh… I made Richard marry me. This is all a sham. Gilbertson
victoriously pumps his fist in the air.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now wait…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Richard. Please. Let me finish. Richard
wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn’t let him.
Don’t blame him. This is all my fault. Could you get the band started?
And give these people something to drink. And you. Meet me at your dingy
in ten, you’re taking me to the airport.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: You got it! Margaret nods, hands
Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all
eyes on her. She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Promise. Margaret walks back into the
house. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Uh-huh. Yeah. That’s great Frank. Good
news. Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So Frank’s back in? Margaret nods
distractedly. Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn’t mean much
right now.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yup. He’s in. For now.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Maybe this’ll be your Mockingbird?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah. Right. Margaret starts collecting
her bags.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Great exit back there.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Thanks. Fun weekend.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Same old, same old, around here.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Wasn’t sure if your mom would want me to
strip the sheets, so I just left them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll let her know.</p>
<p>****: Why did you tell them all that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It was getting too messy. We weren’t going
to be able to keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t start lying to me now. Margaret stops
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I heard you and Gertrude at the school. I
think she meant what she said. She’s a great girl, you should stay. It’s
the right thing. You’re perfect for each other.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But… but what about you? What are you gonna
do? Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Don’t worry about me. I’ll survive.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So what? This is it?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yup. This is it.</p>
<p>****: Have an amazing life, OK? You’re a good person. You deserve it.
She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it. It’s electric, but
Margaret denies it. MARGARET Goodbye, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I want you to say the words.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not doing great in the dignity
department, can we not do this right now?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Say it. Margaret closes her eyes.
Hating that it’s come to this.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ll publish your book. Gilbertson
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Now was that so hard?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: So here’s the deal. I’m going to have a
million questions for you tomorrow… Gertrude sits down next to
Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks. Richard thanks her with a kiss on
the cheek. Then, realizing where and who he is with, he puts his beer
down. He turns to Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a
kiss on the lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss. When they
finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed. Richard looks worried.
Something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: You have been practicing.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Waddya mean?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Well. Margaret told me that you, uh,
turned into bit of a man whore down there. Richard looks down. A bit
ashamed. Gertrude makes light. GERTRUDE You’re gonna have to put that in
check if you move back. Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real
options up here… and I’ll kick that bitch’s ass. Richard gives her a
polite smile. He’s not really in the mood to joke. Gertrude notices.
GERTRUDE So no jokes yet? Too soon?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just a little… confused.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: That kiss didn’t seem “confused.” Richard
takes a beat to collect himself.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re amazing, Gert. And I’ve thought
about being with you for a long time. A long time. When you said those
things at the school? I’ve dreamed about hearing you say those
things.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I think I have to find out.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Find out what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins
to tear up, but won’t let herself cry.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Well. OK then. What’s a girl gonna do? I
guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p>****: But, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: Uh-huh. Richard gets up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>gertrude</strong>: I’m fine. Really. Go. Gertrude nods her
approval and Richard runs off to the party.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: What are you so God damn happy about?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What? Oh. Well, I’m, uh, going to see
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: She violated you. We should report her.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Who you gonna report her to, mom?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh my God. He’s got the Stockholm
syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t have the Stockholm syndrome. And
she didn’t violate me.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What is going on, Richard? Richard slows
down and explains to his mom.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry I lied to you. That was an awful
thing to do. But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and
screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me. I think she’s… the one.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: But you already thought she was the one.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I didn’t. Not until she left.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Really? Does she think that too?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve got to get to the
airport to find out. Debbie doesn’t say anything, then breaks into a
smile.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He’s going to stop her from leaving! At the
airport!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But I gotta hurry. Her plane leaves any
second. I might not make it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He’s not sure he’s going to make it!</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Are you buying this horse shit?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh, Geoffrey!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t have time to explain this to
you.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Well then make some god-damn time. Cause I
won’t let you throw your life away for some woman.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t care. I love you and want you to
understand. But I’m not asking your permission here. I’m doing this.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands
up and shouts.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Boys! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! But
suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie’s face. She grabs the
table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth, causing a loud
crash. Geoffrey and Richard run over.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Mom, are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m having a… I need to go to the hospital.
Fast.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Is this another gay assistant?
Margaret doesn’t say anything and takes her seat.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Richard! She has something she wants to
say to us! Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie. Their three
heads are very close together. Annie speaks to them both through the
oxygen mask.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Listen to me. You two need to stop fighting.
You’ll never see eye to eye, but you’re family. If this doesn’t stop,
one day you’ll regret it. Promise me you’ll stand by Richard, even if
you don’t agree with him.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: I… I promise.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And Richard. Promise you’ll work harder to be
a part of this family.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I promise, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: OK, then. Annie closes her eyes. She looks
peaceful. A moment passes.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: What… what is going on? Did you fake a
heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We didn’t have time for your squabbling, and
I knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport. It seemed
like the best way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The best way?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And remember, you two promised me that you’re
going get along. I wasn’t kidding about that.</p>
<p><strong>coast guard pilot</strong>: Ma’am, I’m not authorized to take
you to the airport…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Larry Ferris! Don’t make me call your
mother!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: …I want my book launch to be
special. I’m thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky Monastery. In
St. Petersberg? Margaret stares at him blankly. MR. GILBERTSON Where
Dostoyevsky is buried? Hello? I thought you were a professional…
Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Flight 1601, you’re clear for takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Roger that, Chuck. The PHONE RINGS in the
tower. Chuck picks up. Intercut as necessary, with Richard running on a
cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Tower. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey Chuck, it’s Richard.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Hey man. Heard about your lady bailing. How
often does this happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Need you to do me a solid, brother. I gotta
see my girl and she’s on that flight. Could you stop it for me?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: No can do brohan. Need a good reason for the
FAA holes. Lose my jobby job if I delivered that favor.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, c’mon Chuck!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: …so next topic. Celebrities. Let’s
invite the Bill Clinton’s and leave out the Paris Hilton’s, OK?
Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave
Sitka.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well. That’s it. Once she gets back to New
York, it’ll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated.
Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: So, you know I think you shouldn’t be with
Margaret, right?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’ve made that crystal clear.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Good. Well, consider this me keeping my
promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button. He waits
for an answer. GEOFFREY Hey! Maguire! Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out
was something. But that’s what I’m calling about. I’ve got a favor to
ask you, ’bout one of your planes…</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: …you know those two hundred pages I
took out? I’m going to put them back… A flight attendant comes to
Margaret and interrupts.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Ms. Mills? Would you come with me?
Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat
belt, about to get out of her seat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: There’s someone on the radio for
you. The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
the front of the plane, outside the cockpit. FLIGHT ATTENDANT Uh, a
Richard Paxton? Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat
belt.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Tell him I’m not here.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I’m sorry. She won’t come talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Shit! She’s never going to pick up…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Know what, home slice? Cut this chica loose.
You remember Beth Cable? She’d totally be into you… Suddenly, Richard
has an idea. He picks up the hand mic.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you
ask the captain to do me one more favor…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
your captain. We’ve reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet. Flight
time’ll be three hours and thirty minutes. And Margaret? Richard has
something he’d like to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh, hey Margaret. And cause I’m on the
loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane. The other passengers look around
to try and figure out who’s Margaret. Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and
acts like she doesn’t know either. RICHARD This certainly isn’t how I
wanted to do this. I mean, I’m not really into the whole baring your
soul in front of strangers thing, but I figure it’s now or never. So
here goes.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You’re doing great, man. Richard pushes the
button down on the hand mike.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I know you’re used to being on your own.
And that you’re comfortable with your life the way it is. And that in a
million years you wouldn’t have thought that we should be together. I
know, because I felt the exact same way.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And you know what else I know? I know that
I’m tired of being alone. And I think you’re tired of being alone too.
So come on. Talk to me. Please. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Do you really feel like you’re
alone?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, good lord.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Everyone in
the tower smiles. They’re making progress.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Have you ever thought there might be a
reason we’ve been together for the last three years?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: As boss and assistant.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Things change, Margaret.</p>
<p>****: Things change?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, things change.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits
Richard, as if to say “see, that’s what I said.” Richard composes
himself.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now, tell me the truth. When you left, were
you relieved or sad that we didn’t have an excuse to be together
anymore? Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up. That was a good one.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Because I am sick that you left. And if you
feel sick too, then why shouldn’t we just be together? Margaret goes to
answer, but stops. Richard is right. She wants to go back. Even the
passengers on the plane can see it. Gilbertson panics.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Are you thinking about going back to
him? Margaret doesn’t answer. MR. GILBERTSON We have a deal! You can’t
back out now! The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is
trying to break up Richard and Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Sir, you need to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: I will do no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Sir, I’m ordering you to return to
your seat. Other passengers yell “sit down asshole” at Gilbertson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Sir, this is your third and final
warning!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: Listen sweetheart… I’m a federal
officer, so why don’t you get me another cocktail and mind your own…
BUZZ! ZAP! 400,000 Volts of electricity surge through Gilbertson. He
twitches violently and crashes to the floor. Behind him, The Handsome
Man holds a stun gun and a badge.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Well, I’m a federal Air Marshall. And
you’re under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible
intoxication.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: This wasn’t supposed to happen. Richard
looks Margaret in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But it did. Margaret looks down. A little
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not the kind of girl who gets saved.
Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and plants a
long, deep, and wet kiss on him. The long kiss is interrupted by the
Handsome Man and Gilbertson.</p>
<p><strong>handsome man</strong>: Uh, sorry, but excuse us. The Handsome
Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson down the steps.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey! Do you think getting arrested might
affect you at work? Gilbertson has no retort.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gilbertson</strong>: So you are getting married this
weekend?</p>
<p>****: Absolutely not. But who knows? We might by the time you get out
of jail. Gilbertson makes a “go to hell” face and shuffles off. Margaret
turns back to Richard. All smiles. MARGARET I’ve got some explaining to
do. Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
Richard’s family. MARGARET Hi. I’m Margaret. I’ve known your son for
years, but we’ve just recently begun to see each other romantically. I
want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska.
I’m not sure when you are going to see him get married, but I promise as
long as I’m with him, he’ll be happy. Passengers cram up to the plane
windows to see what will happen.</p>
<p><strong>grandma annie</strong>: That’s all we ever wanted. Grandma
Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug. Debbie joins in. Then
Geoffrey. Passengers cheer.</p>
