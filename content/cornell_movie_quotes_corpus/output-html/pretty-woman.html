<p><strong>edward</strong>: Left pocket.</p>
<p><strong>investment banker 1</strong>: Our banks certainly doesn’t
want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We
think this is a great new venue for you but you’ve got to understand the
mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in
inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the
risk.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Look, we’re talking about hard assets and a
straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this
deal.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: This is a “no brainer”. There’s no risk for
you. No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>investment banker 2</strong>: Not yet. But ship building is a
new endeavor for you…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Come on. You know we’re not going to go
into ship building. Besides, you’re the ones with the troubled track
record, not us!</p>
<p><strong>investment banker 3</strong>: Bill, be reasonable. If you’re
really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not
be such a problem. Besides, I don’t think there’s anywhere else you can
go for the money in the time you have.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in
the pool at sixteen and a half. I can secure the other half personally.
You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The meeting is over, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Hah! Did you see the look on their
faces?</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: You don’t think we pushed too hard?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: NO way! They’ll come back. They can’t
afford not to. Edward, that bluff was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Maybe I should have made it rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well! It’s late. We’ve been at this long
enough.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Gentlemen, enjoy the party. The magician’s
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Watch your left pocket.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Phone call, Mr. Harris. It’s Miss
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Cynthia? Is she coming out?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We’re about to find out. Go on. Take care of
your guests.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Where are you, Cynthia? I see. No, I don’t
expect you to be at my beck-and-call. Are you coming or not?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Prepare the filing papers. Have them ready
by the middle of the week. I’ll tell you when to submit them.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Edward!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Will we see you at the polo matches
Wednesday?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wouldn’t miss it. I want this done fast and
easy. No slip-ups. I want to be back in New York by Saturday. Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Bill?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Oh… Hi, honey… Millicent, uh, uh,
Millicent.</p>
<p><strong>millicent</strong>: Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Lowell, right. My wife, Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is Edward leaving?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: What’s up, where you going?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Give me your car keys, will you, I’m going
back to my hotel.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: At least stay for a drink. This party’s for
you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Apologize to Elizabeth for me.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Listen, there’re some major local talent
inside just dying to meet you…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Really? Some high class gold digger who
speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone
with one.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Cynthia’s not coming?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Let your driver take you. We’ll move the
cars…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Can you drive a stick?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, give me a break!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Love this car! Is it new?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Yes! And you don’t even know where you’re
going!</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: That’s the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Rent. You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Don’t give me that. Kit gave it to you
yesterday, cash.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Kit give me nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You bullshittin’ me?</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Of rent I do not bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: By the end of the week or you’re otta
here. By the way, you look very nice tonight!</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Hey, baby, you lookin’ for a date?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Chan, you seen Kit tonight?</p>
<p><strong>cook 1</strong>: Hi, hi! No see nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You do, tell her I’m looking for her.</p>
<p><strong>cook 2</strong>: Looking good, bay-bee.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, you too, D’Nai. If Kit comes in here,
tell her stay.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: They just pulled her out of a dumpster in the
back. Now talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I tell you, man, I don’t know who she hang
with.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: She have a pimp?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Cocaine her pimp, man. She a strawberry. She be
out on these streets, day in, day out, tradin’ her sorry ass for crack.
And now she dead from it.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You spent it on drugs, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Lookin’ good, baby.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Did you blow it all, Kit? Is it all
gone?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Carlos had some great rock.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I bet. That was our rent!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Calm down, Chica.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Ey! What is it you wan’, baby? I can fix you
up.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Beat it, scum bucket!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You kiss your mother with that mouth? Your
frien’ still owes me 200.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Get out of my face or I’ll have those cops
on your ass in two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Don’t take no dates tonight, chica, you got
one with me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: We worked for that money. We were gonna put
together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this
street.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Viv… don’t be stupid. We’re whores.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I just saw somebody pulled out of a
dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Don’t be mad at me. I’ll pay you back. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I thought you were giving up that drug
shit.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I will. I’m trying. Meanwhile I got some crack
left, you wanna get high?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No, let’s go to work. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Okay. I’m sorry I said your dream was
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: No no, honey. You see these stars on the
sidewalk. Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy
Rogers. This is our office. We got seniority. Get off our corner.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I was just taking a rest here. Besides,
she’s new.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: But I’m old. Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra
Paget where you belong.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Looks slow tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you
and –</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Forget it. We work for it. We keep it.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I can’t handle this tonight. I’m going
home.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.
There isn’t even milk in the fridge. The rent’s due. Now come on –</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Hey, hey – There’s a rent.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He’s not gonna want us.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Don’t take less than a hundred. You look hot
tonight. And remember, don’t mouth off. They don’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay. Go home. But take it easy on that
shit.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: You’re the greatest. I’ll wait up for you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hey Sugar, you lookin’ for a date?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You looking’ for some company?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What? You gonna tell me you’re lost?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Great. What do I look like a tourguide?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No, you look like a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Actually, I’m a movie star out for a
walk.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly
Hills?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Sure. For five bucks.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: The price just went up to ten.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why don’t you just do it out of the kindness
of your heart?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Sit… and spin.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sit-and-spin. Alright… why not?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You have change for a twenty.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: For twenty, Ill show you personal.

<p><strong>edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Stolen?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Mind if I turn on some heat?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: If you can figure it out, be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Very good. You’re obviously mechanical.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You’re not from L.A., huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: New York.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What motel you staying at?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay, what hotel?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.
Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name’s
Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You like being a hooker, Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It pays.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So do day jobs.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Day jobs, yeah. I’ve tried them. Turn
right.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Must be dangerous. Hooking.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Tell me about it. L.A. is suffering from a
wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I
mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the
free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I’m
probably safer.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Very good. You ought to have that printed up
on your business card.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: If you’re making fun of me, I don’t like
it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sorry. If I did, I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ugly habit, biting your nails.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You don’t know habits, you think this is
ugly.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay, pull over. Let me out. I’ve got to get
back to work.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you charge for company, Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Company would cost you… a hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: For the whole night?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: For an hour.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I never joke about money.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour
though. That’s pretty stiff.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No, but it’s getting there.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, how much to put up with me for the
entire night?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You couldn’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What’s your name, lover.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Edward. My name is Edward.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Edward… you got it!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Get in. This side.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You know how to drive a stick?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Better believe it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Then let’s go. It’s worth 300 just so I
don’t have to drive.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Here we go Edward.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My raincoat’s in the back. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You may feel more comfortable. This is not
the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You mean they don’t have hookers.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Every place has hookers, but if this hotel
has hookers, they don’t look like they’re…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Off the boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Great. Now I took like a hooker in a
trenchcoat.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: So let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good evening. Penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Penthouse. My, my.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: The penthouse. And step on it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Room service. What do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Diet coke.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Can I have some chips?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: – and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Impressed?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You kidding? I come here all the time. As a
matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Want to know something? I don’t quite know.
I hadn’t planned this.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Do you plan everything?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well, the meter’s running, it’s your money.
Speaking of which, cash’ll do. In advance.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let’s talk some more first.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Right. So! In town on business?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Let me guess, you’re a… lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I dunno… you have that sharp, useless
look.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sounds like you’ve known a lot of
lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’ve known a lot of everybody.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Champagne.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hey. I might as well make myself useful.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Where would you like it?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Where would we like it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Where would we like it? Here’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think he wanted you to tip him.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Tsk. Excuse me, I didn’t think he had change
for a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have both.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Where are they? Shopping together?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They should be. They’re both good at it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s a very good year.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oooh, thank god.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Try a strawberry.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Because they bring out the flavor of the
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Jesus, you act like you’re seducing some
Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian… the meter’s running… cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You really are a very beautiful girl.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Just a romantic, that’s you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you like?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: If I want you to turn me on I’ll pay you
three hundred. Just lay back and let me drive.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sorry. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Kross knows we’re after his company. He
wants to talk with you. I don’t think you should.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, if the three of us sit down
together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street
Journal.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll see him alone. Everyone knows you’re my
muscle. We’ll make it social. Tell Kross I’ll meet him for dinner.
Tonight if you can arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: You shouldn’t go alone. He might claim that
you tried to black mail him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bill, we’re businessmen, not the damn mafia.
I’ll see you in the office. By the way, about your car…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Oh, god, what?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll bring it back.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You didn’t wake me. I’ll be out of here in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Only if you do.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Occupational hazard?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I took the couch. I had some work to do.
About last night…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside
myself.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mmm, I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I just hope it was worth three hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’d say you give a good dollar value.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do you ever… enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I like guys if that’s what you’re asking.
Not that I trust’m.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No? Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: “Occupational hazard”.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I buy companies.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No shit. They expensive?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The one I’m buying this week will cost
around 150 million.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: … dollars?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: So what a ya do with the companies once you
buy’m?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I sell them.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: By breaking up a company’s assets –</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What are assets?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian –</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: C’mon, I might buy a company some day.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Assets are anything of value a company owns.
Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off,
I make a profit.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Sorta like stealing cars and selling’m for
parts, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not… quite.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: There, see? Now the emblem is right in the
middle of the knot.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Where’d you learn to do this?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I fucked the debate team in high school.
Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim
in your bathtub before I hit it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t drown.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You could hold a pep rally in here!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, it’s me. Kross is all set for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Listen, I gotta say this again, I don’t
like you going alone.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m a big boy.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Let me at least get you a date. Keep it
social.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I know a lot of nice girls.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have one.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: All right. How much for the week?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m in town until Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It’d cost you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Of course. How much?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Five full nights… days too?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Four thousand.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, may I point out five more nights at
three hundred a night is only 1,500.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: But you want days too.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: All right, two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m not just talking about sex.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Look butthead, I’ll treat you so nice you’ll
never want to let me go, okay?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I
will let you go.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll be out most of the day.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I want you to go out and buy some decent
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.
Conservative. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, you want me to dress like your high
class girlfriend. You’re wasting your money though. All I’m gonna do is
hang around the hotel. As a matter of fact, I may never get out of that
bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Think again. I’m taking you out to an
important dinner with me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Three thousand…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Three thousand!</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: ’Lo.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Kit! Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I was asleep. You woke me. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in
the Ferrari, I’m at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it’s this
absolutely unbelievable place and he’s hired me for a whole week and
Kit, listen, he’s paying me three thousand bucks! We can get out of the
apartment. We can get out of this town. We can do anything! Kit? Hey,
you there?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Why’d he want you?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He… he just does.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I’m sorry, Viv’. Carlos has been on my back.
Did you get the money up front like I taught ya’?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Three hundred for last night and he gave me
extra to buy some clothes. Now listen, I’m gonna leave an envelope for
you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the
other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent. Spend it on
drugs and I’ll pull your hair out.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I’m getting dressed now. I’ll be over. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good
stuff on him.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: In Beverly Hills?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Baby! Rodeo Drive.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m just looking, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Are you looking for something in
particular?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yes. Something… conservative.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You have beautiful things. How much is
this?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: I don’t think it would fit you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I didn’t ask if it would fit. I asked how
much it was.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: It’s very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What is with you?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m going to spend money.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: I don’t think we have anything for you
here. You’re obviously in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: May I help you Miss?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m just going to my room.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: You’re a guest here?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m – I’m with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: And who is that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I… Edward…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He knows me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Do you know this young lady?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: She’s with Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Mr. Harris?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: She apparently joined him last night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Why don’t you come with me. We’ll chat
for just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Miss Vivian… things that go on in other
hotels don’t happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Niece?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris
leaves, I won’t see you in this hotel again.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: That’s what I was trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Women’s clothing. Bridget, please.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Barney.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Okay… this is the jewel in Kross’s crown. We
can strip out all the heavy equipment. Some of the cranes are very
valuable overseas. The Japanese are salivating for them.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Prime industrial property straddling the
Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles. It gives me a hard-on.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s that long building over there?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Storage, I think.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not with those smokestacks it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Let me check.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The real estate possibilities are endless.
Most of the yard we’ll just level. I talked to a couple of developers,
under the table, of course, and they said –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I talked to some developers about the
land.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: What kind of an idiot are you? You don’t
talk about this to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They’re close friends, they’d never breathe a
word –</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Where did you dig this moron up?</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: He’s right, Jake, that was an incredibly
stupid thing to do. It won’t happen again, Edward. I’ll pull him off the
project immediately.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We don’t have the time to bring someone new
up to speed. Besides… You’ve already impressed everyone you need to,
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It won’t happen again, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: This is interesting. That building is storage
now, but it used to be a smelting plant. They closed it down after World
War</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I want our lawyers to check into the toxic
waste licences on them right away. I want to know if the permits are
still valid and what kind of limits are on them.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Jesus, yes. It’s a long shot but if the
permits are still in effect, they’re worth a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What time’s diner tonight?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Eight o’clock. Kross is bringing his son.
Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who’s this girl you’re
taking?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No one you know.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: You must be Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: No wonder. For starts, you should know that
hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.
What are your plans while you’re in town?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well… I might be going out to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: You’ll want a cocktail dress then. Turn.
You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply
lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go
with a cocktail dress?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Philip! We’ll need shoes!</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Your uncle will like this.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He’s not really my uncle.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: They never are, dear.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I got a dress.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: I rather hoped you’d be wearing it.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I didn’t want to get it messed. I got shoes
too. Wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: That’s all right. I’m sure they’re quite
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: They were real nice to me there. They
treated me, y’know… nice. Thanks, Barney.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: You’re very welcome, Miss Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Never answer the phone. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Tsk, believe me, this will be the last
time.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did you buy some clothes?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I got a dress, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Just one? Christ… I hope it’s
appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It’s very tasteful. I think you’ll
especially like the zipper in the crotch. I’m – joking.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let’s hope so. You’ll get some more clothes
tomorrow. I’ll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven
forty-five sharp. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No, I don’t “got it”. Even the farmboys back
in Georgia come to the door when they’re taking you on a date.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This isn’t a date.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Go by yourself then. Where you taking me
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The Rex.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Any good?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think you’ll approve.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: … all right. I’ll meet you in the lobby. But
only cause you’re paying me to.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I thought I told you not to answer the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oooh!</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed.
5:00, I turn down the bed.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Is there a trick to it?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Is that all? You just fold back the
bedspread?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I also place las chocolates on the pillow.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oooh, I love those.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I leave extras, miss.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich people so
lazy they can’t do this on their own?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Barney.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: What is it, Miss Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Edward is taking me to some fancy place for
dinner. The Rex. Ever been there?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: It’s a bit beyond my… range, shall we
say.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y’know,
normal?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: I think you’ll find it normal
enough.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Will I like it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: You’ll like it fine.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay. Thanks, Barney. You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Just mind which fork you use.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Fork?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: In fifteen minutes I can teach you
everything you need to know to dine with the Queen. First, as you pick
up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: But I always eat like this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Either you’re European or badly brought
up.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hmmm… I vonder vich.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Actually, some of the richest people I
know have the worst manners. Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money,
knows his way around a table. All right now, pay attention please. Salad
fork.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What if they serve soup?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: They will serve salad.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: But what if they serve soup?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Then you use your soup spoon.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I like steak.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Then you would use your–</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Steak spoon!</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Miss Vivian –</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Maybe I’ll just order a burger, Barney, that
way I can eat with my hands.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Miss Vivian… there’s a salon here in the
hotel. Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don’t
you just have your hair done instead?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Professionally?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I have a friend who has a friend who does
Cher’s wigs.</p>
<p><strong>thane</strong>: I hate him already. All set?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah… what a ya say we chop it all off and
bleach the tips.</p>
<p><strong>thane</strong>: Darling? Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Barnard Thomas, manager of the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Of course, yes. If you’ll excuse me just a
moment –</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: I have a message for you from your
“niece”, sir.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: The young lady staying in your room?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think we both know she’s not my niece.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest
of ours and shall be treated accordingly. The young lady asked me to
tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Very intriguing young woman, Miss
Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You’re forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: So young man, I understand you are trying to
take over my company.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Please don’t patronize me, Mr. Kross. Our
ages mean nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mr. Harris, we know you’ve purchased at least
twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid
for a majority share.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Twenty-five percent.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself.
I know every man who ever worked there by his first name. I know their
wives… and their children. If your intention is to take over my company
and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: What would it take to buy our stock back?
Name your price.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: To get me in a mood to sell – double what I
paid. But your company doesn’t have enough capital right now to buy
anything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re on the verge of closing a large navy
contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on
your shares. We would give you a promissory note…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re not getting any navy contracts.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s no way you could know that.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But I do know. I also know your lines of
credit are over-extended. If I don’t buy your company, someone else
will… Ah, the escargot.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Scume me, what are these things?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Escargot, mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Snails.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mr. Kross, I’m not here to sell you my
stock. On the contrary, I’m here to buy yours.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: You’ve got a lot of nerve.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. What I have is a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you
buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds
are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up
in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What I did with those companies was
perfectly legal.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I don’t question the legality of what you do.
It’s your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be
raped by a man like you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It is not your company. It’s a public
company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock
holders, or I buy from you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Slippery little suckers…</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: If you’ll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris…
Deal with this, David, you know where we stand. I need to go someplace
and puke.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Men like my father built this country. He was
no saint. He screwed people. But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a
hundred a good job.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He seems like a nice man.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We can reach an understanding on this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t think so. You should know we’re going
to fight you with every resource we have.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do what you have to do. I don’t take it
personally.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I do. I take it all very personally. Very
nice meeting you, Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And that’s the way the game is played.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Some game. Screwin’ some poor slob out of
his retirement.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Snails for dinner. No wonder everybody is in
such a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are we ready for the next course, sir?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. Bring a check, please.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You’re upset, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Upset. No. I never get upset about
business.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You liked the guy, though.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.
It’s business. There’s no emotion involved in business… if you want to
survive.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: We’re the exactly the same! Kit keeps
telling me don’t get emotional when you turn tricks – that’s why no
kissing – it’s too personal. The key is like you’re saying, stay numb,
don’t get involved – when I’m with a guy, I’m a robot, I just do it.
Except with you. At your price I give my all…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That… is very good.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Know what we’re gonna do in a little while
then? We’re gonna call Domino’s and have’m deliver a bigass pizza. We’re
gonna eat it in bed. We’re gonna veg’ out and watch television.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Television?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, it’s this box, it has pictures, sound.
You don’t have to use your brain at all.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have work to do.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Uh-uh. No work.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wake up, Vivian. Time to shop.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I still don’t understand why you only bought
one dress.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I wasn’t as much fun as I thought it was
going to be.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well, you know those cold bitches that work
in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Was someone rude to you?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I had a little problem in one store. I
wasn’t dressed right. I don’t know what to say. I don’t belong there.
Maybe I’ll just go back to Bridget. She was cool.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don’t
care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not
you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Come with me?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hello. Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m looking for a dress, nothing too flashy,
not too sexy, conservative. In a size six.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: Do… do you have a charge account with
us?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Kross came out of his corner swinging. He
started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He’s a tough old son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: It’s up to ten and a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Offer nine and a half. Bring them back down
to earth.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to
fight?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Someone’s loaning it to him. Get on it right
away.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Our contract guys are working on the Kross
pension funds. There’s another forty million there. We can bleed’m
dry.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Put the pension funds on hold until I say
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: We’re letting them slide?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I want the treatment plant licenses to be
top priority right now.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: But, Edward…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re on your own now, Vivian. I’ve got to
get to work. Be sensible and you can keep everything. Spend too much and
it all goes back.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Not me!</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Horrid!</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Where’d you get your tie?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Isn’t this lovely? I think it would look
wonderful on you.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Would you like to try it on?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: ’Scume me.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: No, I’m sorry, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I was in here yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah. That’s right. It’s me. I want you to
know something. You made me feel terrible. I wasn’t dressed right and
you said I didn’t belong here. Well, I do. You’re the one that was
wrong, not me. And I want to tell you something else. I’m never gonna
shop here again as long as I live.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Wheee!!!</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: You were right. Kross mortgaged everything
he has down to his grandson’s college tuition to secure loans from a
bank. Not just any bank. One we do business with.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong
with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds. Now, you’re
giving him the chance to get away? As of two minutes ago, you are
committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Come on, Bill, don’t talk to me about how
much money’s involved. It’s my money.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: And some of it’s mine. Edward, his
jugular’s exposed.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Get the bank on the phone for me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I thought maybe you’d like dinner.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thank you. I would. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Wait till you see what I have on
underneath.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Dinner can wait.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You always been rich?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Seems like it. I guess it’s easy to get used
to, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Easier than learning how to be poor. My
father’s family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and
houses, private schools, nannies. But then my father divorced my mother
to marry another woman. And he took his money with him.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Keep talkin’. I like hearin’.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not much to tell. I went to public school.
Went to university on scholarship. Went to work for an investment firm.
In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the
third company I ever went after. I swallowed that company and shit out
the pieces. One of the pieces was him.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You still mad at’m?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He died a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Miss Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You have a call. Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hi, baby. I’ll be ready. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What do you wear to polo?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You’re really pushing it, bringing me
here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think it’s exciting.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What id we run into someone I know?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I really doubt anyone here frequents
Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward!</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Well, well, well…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bill, I’d like you to meet Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife,
Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Lots of fun people here. Let me get you two
some champagne.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth stuckey</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Real genuine guy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He’s good at what he does.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You could freeze ice on his wife’s ass. She
anything like your ex?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Shall we mingle?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I simply love your dress, Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: This old thing?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Of course, a figure like yours can wear
anything. You must work out constantly.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I lead a very physical life.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Are you into running, Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m into walking. I walk a lot.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: You look awfully familiar, Vivian.
Haven’t we run into one another at the spa in La Costa?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well, I do often spa there.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth stuckey</strong>: Edward, she’s marvelous. Warm and
witty and down to earth.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She is, isn’t she.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth stuckey</strong>: So unlike your usuals. Where on
earth did you find her?</p>
<p><strong>a woman</strong>: We’re good together. He has to admit it.
I’ve been just what he wants me to be. I say the right things, I know
the right people, I give wonderful parties. No question, no arguments,
no embarrassments. It works for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Edward, these women here, I don’t think any
of’m like the guys they’re with. They’re just into it for the money.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m sure that’s true for some of them.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I thought I was the pro. These women make me
feel like an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ready to stomp sod?</p>
<p><strong>david kross</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hi. I never thought stomping in grass could
be so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I like your hat.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Huh? Oh… yeah. S’okay? Uhm… how’re… business
things going.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s not talk about it, it’s too depressing.
Come on, I’ll show you Thunder.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Please, we hardly know each other.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thunder’s a horse. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am.
This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hope to be?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It’s… it’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I see. Well. Maybe that means you’d have
lunch with me sometime then.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You don’t know anything about me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’d like to find out. You don’t know anything
about me either. That’s why people have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Fill me in on this. How’d you and Vivian
meet?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We just did.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like
to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The night I left your house, I was lost. I
was looking for directions.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: And you just happened to run into her.
Great. What’s she do? She work?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian’s in sales.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Sales, really? That’s great. What does she
sell?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Hear me out. I’ve known you a long time. I
see a difference in you this week. Like that tie. I’m suddenly wondering
if this girl’s not the difference. Especially when I see her talking
with David Kross.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She met him at dinner last night… I like
this tie.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: So now they’re best friends? Edward, this
girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose
company we’re trying to buy. It’s too convenient.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re being ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.
Edward, how do you know she hasn’t attached herself to you so she can
bring Kross back information?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Christ, Bill, she’s not a spy, she’s a
hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I swear to God, you are the only
millionaire I ever heard of who’d go looking for a goddam bargain
streetwalker!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let’s drop it, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Edward! May we have your opinion on
something?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Excuse me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Having a good time, Vivian?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: All this must be quite a change from
Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: It’s okay. Edward told me. Your secret’s
safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me at the Regent
Beverly Wilshire.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I just might do that.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re awfully quiet. You haven’t said a
word since the party.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You asshole! I can’t believe what a –!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, what the –</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?! What
are you trying to prove!? I’m not a piece of meat for you to offer to
your friends!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’ve been with stinking old men who’ve made
me want to puke but I’ve never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you
did tonight.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Would you please calm down. Tell me what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Stuckey! He wants an “appointment” with me
after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What was I supposed to do? I told the truth.
Why should the truth upset you? It’s not as if you’re from a
convent.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I want my fucking money. I’m getting out of
here. I don’t want anything more to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Can we talk about this? Can you just try to
calm down?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only
reason I’m with you is for the money.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well, it’s true. Just pay me what you owe me
and I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and
smash your face in.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fine. I’m only here a couple of more days
and I’m not going to spend them fighting with you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll call you a cab. If you want the
clothes, pack them up.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian… I’m sorry. I wasn’t prepared for
questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I
should have known that it would hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m not hurt. It doesn’t hurt you when
somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I really am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: This is no time to disappear. We’re in too
far.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn’t going
anywhere and I don’t need to spend the rest of the day watching his
stock go down. I’ll be in the office tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Promise me you’ll read those contracts by
then.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Goodbye, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Shit… By tomorrow, Edward!</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: C’mon, Kit…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Do I look okay?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hmm… let’s see… no, there’s something
missing.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t want you to get too excited… these
are on loan… however…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This is made for a princess. I think she’d
approve of you wearing it tonight. There. Come look.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Edward, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Shush. Of course you can.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What if I lose it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What if someone tries to steal it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll guard them and you with my life.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Your plane is ready to go, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Plane?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You don’t want to go all the way to San
Francisco in a limousine, do you? I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Where are you taking me!?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet…
Benoit, a landlord… Mimi, a flower maker…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The opera.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’ve never been on a plane before.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m glad you like it. Now be quiet, I’ve
really got to read these.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, what do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Being quiet.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You ever been in love with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Sorry. You’re not paying me to ask you
question like that.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian. I’m paying you to be you. Be you.
Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You mean, besides Elvis? I’m a human being.
Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as
Atlanta. I met this boy. He’d been with his parents on their way to
Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he
came back they’d split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw,
he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y’know, dark hair and eyes.
The chicken hawks were on him all the time. He hated that. Sometimes
we’d find a safe place to crash nights and we’d curl up together and
we’d talk about all these crazy things. The two of us getting married
someday. Having kids. Stupid stuff.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: My father found me. Dragged me home. I don’t
know why, he never seemed to like me much when I was there. ’Cept when
he was drunk, then he liked me a whole lot. I made it back to Atlanta a
year later. Andy was gone.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Aw, but things sure look fine when you’re
sitting way up high.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Some people say that opera is an acquired
taste, but I don’t believe it. You can always tell when someone goes to
the opera for the first time. They either love it or hate it. Those who
love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate
it, but they’ll never truly love it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Viv? I really doubt if anyone here is going
to try and grab it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They all think you look very beautiful,
Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: If it’s in Italian, how will I know what
they’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll whisper some of the main parts of the
story to you. But you’ll be surprised how much you understand. The music
conveys the story more powerfully than any words.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: But don’t they have it in English?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, don’t be afraid of what you don’t
know. That’s the fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Okay. Even if I hate it, I’m glad you
brought me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What am I? I am a poet. Not a man of wealth
but one rich in dreams. You have come to replace my vanished dreams. I
dwell now only in your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks
her beautiful –</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Did you enjoy the opera, dear?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It was so beautiful I just about pissed my
pants.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: If you’d gone on about how much you liked
it, I’m not sure I’d have believed you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I more than liked it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I know. I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. I’ve never enjoyed it more. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Love you…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Did I wake you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m up.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I had to call. I jus got off the phone with
James Kross. Get this. He wants to see you. Today.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: He wouldn’t say. Edward… I think we got
him. His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Give me twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: We’ll be there. Listen, if he’s really
caving in, we’ll go from there down to the office. I want him to commit
his stock to us this morning.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Mmm. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Better get dressed. We’re having guests.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Here. Let me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: One more night and you’re finally rid of
me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, you’ve been pretty tough to take.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have to go to New York tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What else? You gonna leave some cash by the
bed when you pass through town?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It wouldn’t be like that. I want to get you
off the street. You’ll have a different kind of life. What’s wrong with
that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m sorry. That’s very sweet, Edward, and I
know you mean it…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, I’ve thought about this a lot. This
is the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: then continues tying</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, life’s not a fairy tale.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I know. Hey, don’t mind me. I’m being
stupid. I’ll think about it, okay? It’s a real good offer for a
whore.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ve never treated you like a whore.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You just did.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How are you, Mr. Kross.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Not bad for a man who hasn’t slept in four
nights. I’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Young lady.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hello. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello, Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Let’s not waste time here, shall we?
Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.
Mr. Harris is now listening.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Yes. I’m here to tell you that I’ve
reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Expected… offer.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Of course, yes. After the expected filing
period is over, I’m going to recommend to the board that we accept your
bid.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re making the right decision, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I’ll see you on one condition. I’m not so
concerned for me but the people who have worked for me…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: They’ll be taken care of. Won’t they,
Edward?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I’ll sign anything you want then.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Excuse me, please?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Hello. Is Kit DeLuca there? When she comes
in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000. Yes. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: What did you do to him?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.
Now he’s beaten. And you liked him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man
realized that it would be better for his future and his son’s future, if
he cooperated.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s not your concern. It’s… business,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Business.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. The man made a business decision.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It’s all just business to you. Him. Me. Your
life. Everything’s business.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s what I do for a living. It’s how I make
money.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll be back in a few hours. We’ll talk
about this later.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We’ll continue this down at the office.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Lo?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I
wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There’s someone here to
see you.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: I’d send them up, but sadly, I don’t
trust the young lady to find you on her own.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Viv? Where are you, babe? The sphincter-police
won’t let me through.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yes, I’m glad you’re clean but I’ve been
calling and calling.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Was that you?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Who did you think?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Kit, I left that money for you days ago.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Yeah. I just got it.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Fifty bucks, grampa. For seventy-five, the wife
can watch.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Kit…</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Everybody keeps starin’ at me.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah… I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: What do you know? You look good. All dressed
up. You clean up real nice. You sure don’t fit in down on the Boulevard,
lookin’ like you do. Not that you ever did anyway.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: You think I fit here where they just about
chew your food for you?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Where do you fit?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Honey, you’re not supposed to do that.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I know. I stopped pretending and started
liking it with him for real.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Oh, my god, you mean it was good?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It was great.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Dummy.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: He wants to set me up in a place, give me
some money.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I pray for that.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: All I’m doing is feeling lousy about it. I
don’t know what to do. What do I do, Kit?</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Go for the bucks.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I don’t care about bucks. I might love this
guy.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Wow, are you in deep shit. You know he’ll break
your heart.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Congratulations, sir.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with
his stock broker. It’s finished. You’ve won.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who are you going after next, sir?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Who indeed…</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: If we can get these letters of intent out
of the way now… Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions
about your company.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dad, excuse me, but that’s inappropriate.
You’re under no obligation to answer any questions at all.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Could we at least wait till after the filing
period?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our
speculation of the corporation’s net worth. The price he ultimately pays
for your father’s stock will be based on that bid. The more we know, the
higher our bid can be.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: It’s in my best interest to cooperate,
David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If he throws himself on your sword, you
promise to take care of him and his family, huh?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: That’s unfair!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You bed it is. You’re everything he said you
were. Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don’t expect me to watch it.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: He’s young. He hasn’t learned how to lose
gracefully yet. I’ll sign your papers. And I’ll answer your questions.
Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I’d like
to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you’re a
target. If you weren’t mine, you’d be someone elses, correct?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: If you had a… reprieve, what would do?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I don’t think there’s any sense in –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let him answer.</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I… I would take advantage of it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: I… I don’t know. There… there wasn’t
time…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I suppose you’d find out soon enough that
you have assets you presently don’t seem aware of, wouldn’t you? The
waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you’d
certainly find out about that.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Oh, my god… Edward, no!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I suppose you’d use them as collateral on
new loans, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Have you lost your mind?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: Quiet. Would I get the loans?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm…
With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can’t logically make a formal bid on
your company, can I?</p>
<p><strong>kross</strong>: You’d be initiating a financial battle you’d
ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re very right. I think the best thing we
could all do is go home.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Have a good day, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, what happened? What kind of move
was that?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Dammit Edward, speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No… take the car back to the hotel. I need
to walk.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Well, well… Hello again. I’m looking for
Edward.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Edward’s not back. I thought he was with
you.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: No, I’ll just have to wait then, won’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Do you want to know what he did? Do you
want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole
thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he
thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why? What was
all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic
foundation? I’ll probably be the director of several worthwhile
charities.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I think it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: I bet. A lousy whore and you’re the gum in
a hundred million dollar deal.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Aw, come on, Bill. It’s just business.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: But what do I know, maybe you’re worth it.
Come on, show me. Let’s see your act.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll pay for it. What a you
charge? Huh? Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? Are you a fifty dollar
whore?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: You got a mean streak in you, don’t
you.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: You broke my nose.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think I broke my hand. You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, we’ve been together ten years.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And I don’t like what we’ve become. I’ll
cover any losses you have on this one. Now get out, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: All this because of that whore!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stuckey</strong>: Edward, think about what you’re –</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well, I didn’t plan that!</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?
Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna
explode. What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you
how? It pisses me off!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit
you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Right. You’re quite the Sir Galahad today,
aren’t ya’? I heard what you did with Kross.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was a business decision.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I got tired of hating my father.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It was good.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It felt good.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re packing.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’m leaving. Don’t ya see? If I stay with
you like you want me to, there’ll always be some guy, your friends eve,
treatin’ me like that… thinkin’ they’re allowed to. What are you gonna
do, fight’m all? No. I’ll take my money now, please.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Aw, don’t… no…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Stay with me tonight. Not because you’re
being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I do. I do want to. That’s why I’m leaving.
That’s what you given me, see? I know what I want now. I want a guy like
you for real. Not because you buy me things and give me money. The
nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me
that?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Vivian…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: It’s not your fault. You’re right. Kit’s
right. But I want the fairy tale.</p>
<p><strong>bellman</strong>: Let me take those, miss.</p>

comin’.</p>

tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, well, I check out today.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: You’re not accompanying him to New
York?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real
world. You don’t know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady,
Mr. Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thomas</strong>: Certain ladies make that very easy…
Vivian. John, call a limousine for our guest, please. Have it take her
anywhere she wishes to go. Bill the hotel. See you again sometime
soon.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You’re sure this is the right street,
ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yes. 1312. It’s a big apartment
building.</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: Maybe I should go with you. This
doesn’t look like a good place for a lady to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I’ll be okay. I’m home. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: Hey, we announce guests here. You a
relative of somebody?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Yeah, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>landlord</strong>: You lookin’ good, Viv’. Nice threads. I

<p><strong>kit</strong>: And leave all this? Not in a million.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Couple a hours.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: Yeah. Well… I gotta split. Goodbye’s make me
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Cool your jets a second. Here’s some
money.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: No. You took care of rent, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I want to. For food, got it? Eat something
before the wind blows you away.</p>
<p><strong>kit</strong>: I’m gonna pay you back next time I see ya,
babe. Just wait, I’m gonna do something real nice for you some day.</p>
