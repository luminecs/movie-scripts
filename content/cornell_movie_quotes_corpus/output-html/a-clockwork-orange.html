<h1 id="a-clockwork-orange">a-clockwork-orange</h1>
<p><strong>int. korova milkbar - night</strong>: Tables, chairs made of
nude fibreglass figures. Hypnotic atmosphere. Alex, Pete, Georgie and
Dim, teenagers stoned on their milk-plus, their feet resting on faces,
crotches, lips of the sculptured furniture.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There was me, that is Alex, and my three
droogs, that is Pete, Georgie and Dim and we sat in the Korova milkbar
trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The
Korova Milk Bar sold milkplus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or
drencrom which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and
make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence. Our pockets were
full of money so there was no need on that score, but, as they say,
money isn’t everything.</p>
<p><strong>int. pedestrian underpass tunnel - night</strong>: A Tramp
lying in tunnel, singing.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: In Dublin’s fair city Where the girls are so
pretty I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone As she wheeled her
wheelbarrow Through streets wide and narrow… Shadows of the boys
approaching fall across Tramp.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Crying cockless and mussels alive, Alive O…
Alive, alive O… Alive, alive O… Crying cockless and mussels alive, Alive
O…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: One thing I could never stand is to see a
filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his
fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was
real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Can you… can you spare some cutter, me
brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp’s stomach. The boys
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard
cowards. I don’t want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like
this.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh - and what’s so stinking about it?</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: It’s a stinking world because there’s no law
and order any more. It’s a stinking world because it lets the young get
onto the old like you done. It’s no world for an old man any more. What
sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around
the earth and there’s not no attention paid to earthly law and order no
more. The Tramp starts singing again.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Oh dear land, I fought for thee and brought
you peace and victory. Alex and gang move in and start beating up on old
Tramp.</p>
<p><strong>int. derelict casino - night</strong>: Billyboy gang on stage
tearing clothes off a screaming Girl.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was around by the derelict casino that we
came across Billyboy and his four droogs. They were getting ready to
perform a little of the old in-out, in-out on a weepy young devotchka
they had there. Alex and gang step out of the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ho, Ho, Ho… Well, if it isn’t stinking
Billygoat Billyboy in poison. How are thou, thou globby bottle of cheap
stinking chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any
yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou. Billyboy snaps open a switchblade
knife.</p>
<p><strong>billy boy</strong>: Let’s get ’em boys. The fight begins,
chains, knives, kicking boots. Police siren.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The Police… come on, let’s go… come on. Alex
and the boys rush out of casino.</p>
<p><strong>ext. / int. car - night - fast driving shots</strong>:
Swerving car, forcing other cars off the road, trying to hit
pedestrians, etc.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The Durango-95 purred away real horrorshow - a
nice, warm vibraty feeling all through your guttiwuts. Soon it was trees
and dark, my brothers, with real country dark. We fillied around for a
while with other travelers of the night, playing hogs of the road. Then
we headed west, what we were after now was the old surprise visit, that
was a real kick and good for laughs and lashing of the
ultra-violent.</p>
<p><strong>ext. “home” - night</strong>: A cottage on its own, on
outskirts of a village. Bright moonlight. Cheery light inside. Car pulls
to stop. Alex shushes his giggling boys and gets out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - night</strong>: Mr. Alexander typing. Bell
rings.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Who on earth could that be?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: I’ll see. Mrs. Alexander, a
good-looking red head in a red jumper suit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: Yes? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Excuse me, Mrs… will you please help, there’s
been a terrible accident. She opens the door on the chain and peeps
out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My friend’s lying in the middle of the road
bleeding to death. Could I please use your telephone for an
ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: I’m sorry, but we don’t have a
telephone. You’ll have to go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But Mrs… it’s a matter of life and death. From
inside the sound of clack clacky clack clack clackity clackclack of
Alexander typing stops.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Who is it, dear?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: There’s a young man here. He says
there’s been an accident. He wants to use the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Then you’d better let him in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Mrs. Alexander opens door,
saying…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. alexander</strong>: I’m sorry, we don’t usually let
people in the middle of the night. Alex and boys have put on their masks
and rush into house, carrying and dragging Mrs. Alexander along with
them.</p>
<p><strong>int. home - night</strong>: They go roaring in. Mr. Alexander
is kicked in the face and goes down. Georgie leaps on him. Pete jumps up
and down and the settee. Dim grabs hold of Mrs. Alexander. Alex whistles
piercingly.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right, Pete. Check the rest of the house. Alex
turns to Dim who holds the struggling Mrs. Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dim… Dim sets her down but holds her firmly.
Alex starts to sing - “Singin’ in the Rain”, accompanying it with a kind
of tap dance.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m singing in the rain… He kicks
Mr. Alexander accenting the lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Just singing in the rain… He clubs
Mr. Alexander with stick, in the time to the music.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What a glorious feeling, I’m happy again. He
pushes a rubber ball into Mrs. Alexander’s mouth and binds it with
sellotape.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m laughing at clouds so dark up above. The
sun’s in my heart and I’m ready for love. Let the stormy clouds chase…
He kicks Mr. Alexander again.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: … everyone from the place. Come on with the
rain… He puts ball in Mr. Alexander’s mouth and sellotapes it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: … I’ve a smile on my face. I’ll walk down the
lane… to a happy refrain. I’m singing… just singin’ in the rain. He
knocks down the book cases and moves to Mrs. Alexander being held by
Dim. Starts to repeat on song as he cuts slowly up each leg of her cat
suit, until she is naked. This coincidences with the song finishing. He
turns to Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Viddy well, my little Brother. Viddy well.</p>
<p><strong>int. korova milkbar - night</strong>: The boys enter
yawning..</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged
and fashed, it having been an evening of some small energy expenditure,
O my brothers, so we got rid of the auto and stopped off at the Korova
for a nightcap. Dim moves over to milk machine and speaks to the statue
of the nude girl.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in
machine.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: We’ve been working hard too. Takes glass.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast,
pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the
others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There was some sophistos from the TV studios
around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking
away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on
the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next
one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like
for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar
and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise,
athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again.
Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by
Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by
two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex
brings his stick down smartly on Dim’s legs.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: What did you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: For being a bastard with no manners and not a
dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: I don’t like you should do what you done. And
I’m not your brother no more and wouldn’t want to be.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Watch that… Do watch that, O Dim, if to
continue to be on live thou dost wish.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I’ll
meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim
weakens.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Doobidoob… a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A
long night for growing malchicks… best not to say more. Bedways is
rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right,
right.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s flatblock - main lobby entrance - night</strong>:
Alex passes a mural in the hall. Nude men and women. Their massive
stylised bodies embellished and decorated by handy pencil and ballpoint.
The elevator door is buckled.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s flat - night</strong>: Alex pees in toilet. Alex
goes into his room. Tosses his loot into a drawer, full of money,
wristwatches, cameras, etc. Fifty small loudspeakers cover one wall. He
puts his pet boa constrictor on tree branch mounted on the wall, above
four Christ figures who have their arms intertwined like a chorus line.
He puts a cassette into the tape player. A heavy shockwave of sound -
Beethoven’s 9th.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It had been a wonderful evening and what I
needed now to give it the perfect ending was a bit of the old Ludwig
van. Music starts.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Then, brothers, it came. O bliss, bliss and
heaven, oh it was gorgeousness and georgeosity made flesh. The trombones
crunched redgold under my bed, and behind my gulliver the trumpets
three-wise, silver- flamed and there by the door the timps rolling
through my guts and out again, crunched like candy thunder. It was like
a bird of rarest spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a
space ship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely
pictures. There were veeks and ptitsas laying on the ground screaming
for mercy and I was smecking all over my rot and grinding my boot into
their tortured litsos and there were naked devotchkas ripped and
creeching against walls and I plunging like a shlaga into them.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s flat - day</strong>: He is asleep. The boa curled
up at his feet. There is a knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What d’you want?</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: It’s past eight, Alex, you don’t want to be late
for school, son.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be
and I’ll try to sleep it off… then I’ll be as right as dodgers for this
after.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: You’ve not been to school all week, son.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve got to rest, Mum… got to get fit,
otherwise I’m liable to miss a lot more school.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Eeee… I’ll put your breakfast in the oven. I’ve
got to be off myself now.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alright, Mum… have a nice day at the
factory.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen - day</strong>: Pee sitting at breakfast table.
Em enters.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: He’s not feeling too good again this morning,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Yes, I heard. D’you know what time he got in
last night?</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: No I don’t know, luv, I’d taken my sleepers.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of
evenings.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Well, like he says, it’s mostly odd things he
does, helping like… here and there, as it might be.</p>
<p><strong>int. em’s bedroom - day</strong>: Alex comes out of his room
and finds P.R. Deltoid sitting on bed in parent’s room.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi, hi, hi there, Mr. Deltoid, funny surprise
to see you here.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met
your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said
something about a pain somewhere… hence not at school , yes?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: A rather intolerable pain in the head,
brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The
evening’s a great time, isn’t it, Alex boy?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: A cup of the old chai, sir?</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex
sits next to him.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?
Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid “playfully” grabs Alex’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Wrong? Why should you think of anything
being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn’t. Yes? He shakes
Alex’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Just a manner of speech, sir.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Well, yes, it’s just a manner of speech
from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little
Alex. He puts his arm round Alex’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Because next time it’s going to be the
barry place and all my work ruined. If you’ve no respect for your
horrible self, you at least might have some for me who’se sweated over
you. He slaps Alex on the knee.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: A big black mark I tell you for every one
we don’t reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends
up in the stripy hole.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve been doing nothing I shouldn’t, sir. The
millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex
down on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Cut out all this clever talk about
milicents. Just because the Police haven’t picked you up lately doesn’t,
as you very well know, mean that you’ve not been up to some nastiness.
There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme
nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy’s friends were ambluenced
off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word’s got thru
to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also.
Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I’m warning
you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in
this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself.
Deltoid makes a grab for Alex’s joint but finds his hand instead. Alex
laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass
of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth
soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth
sounding like ice-cubes.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: What gets into you all? We study the
problem. We’ve been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but
we get no further with our studies. You’ve got a good home here, good
loving parents, you’ve got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that
crawls inside of you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Nobody’s got anything on me, brother, sir.
I’ve been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: That’s just worries me. A bit too long to
long to be reasonable. You’re about due now by my reckoning, that’s why
I’m warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out
of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure
sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but
this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.</p>
<p><strong>int. music bootick - day</strong>: Alex enters. Two pretty
micro-boppers, Marty and Sonietta, sucking phallic ice sticks.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Pardon me, brother. I ordered this two weeks
ago. Could you see if it’s arrived.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: OK. I’ll see if it’s in. Clerk exits. Alex
turns to the girls.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Pardon me, ladies He steps in between them and
goes through the motions, looking through.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Enjoying it then, my darling?… A bit cold and
pointless isn’t it, my lovely… What’s happened to yours, my little
sister? Marty giggles.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Who you getten bratty, Goggly Gogol? Johnny
Zhivago? The Heaven Seventeen?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What you got back home, little sister, to play
your fuzzy warbles on? I bet you got little save pitiful portable picnic
players. Come with Uncle and hear all proper. Hear angel trumpets and
devil trombones. You are invited.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s bedroom - day</strong>: The two girls, naked,
jumping up and down on Alex’s still unmade bed zonked by the booming,
all engulfing sound of Alex’s incredible Hi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s flatblock - lobby hall - day</strong>: Alex finds
the gang waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi, hi, hi, there</p>
<p><strong>all three</strong>: Well, .</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly,
well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
Georgie rises.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: We got worried. There we were waiting and
drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we
thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so
around we come to your abode.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain
in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders
for awakening.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to
much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You
sure the pain’s gone? You sure you’ll not be happier back up in bed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This
sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I
am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now
then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: All right, no more picking on Dim, brother.
That’s part of the new way.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: New way? What’s this about a new way? There’s
been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me
hear more.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Well, we go round shop crasting and the
like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Pitiful rookerful…</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: And there’s Will the English in the
Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that
any malchick tries to crast.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Yeah… Pete the English.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big
money is available’s what Will the English says.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Big, big money.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And what will you do with the big, big, money?
Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it
from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Brother, you think and talk sometimes like
a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to
them as waits. I’ve taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me
what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you
not say</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Moloko-plus.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Something to sharpen us up, you especially.
We have the start.</p>
<p><strong>ext. flatblock marine - day</strong>: The gang come out of
the flatblock and walk along the marina.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As we walked along the flatblock marina, I was
calm on the outside but thinking all the time, so now it was to be
Georgie the General, saying what we should do and what not to do, and
Dim as his mindless, grinning bulldog. But, suddenly, I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones and that the oomny ones use like
inspiration and what Bog sends, for now it was lovely music that came to
my aid and I viddied at once what to do. There was a window open with
the stereo on.</p>
<p><strong>in slow motion</strong>: Alex clubs Georgie into water with
his stick. Dim swings chain. Alex ducks. Dim goes into water. Alex
kneels, hands behind back, takes knife from sword stick, offers hand to
help Dim, and slashes Dim when he gets it. Dim falls back into the
water. Alex laughs.</p>
<p><strong>int. duke of new york pub</strong>: The four boys sit round
table.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I had not put into any of Dim’s main cables
and so, with the help of a clean tashtook, the red, red kroovy stopped,
and it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers, down in
the snug in the Duke of New York. Now they knew who was Master and
Leader. Sheep, thought I, but a real leader knows always when like to
give and show generous to his unders.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, now we’re back to where we were. Yes?
Just like before and all forgotten? Right, right, right.</p>
<p><strong>all boys</strong>: Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, Georgie Boy. This idea you’ve got for
tonight. Well, tell us all about it then.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Not tonight - not this nochy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You’re a big
strong chelloveck like us all. We’re not little children, are we,
Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation.
Georgie backs down.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: It’s this Health Farm. A bit out of the
town. Isolated. It’s owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there
with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she’s completely on
her own, and it’s full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Tell me more, Georgie Boy.</p>
<p><strong>int. catlady’s house</strong>: Catlady doing yoga exercises.
Room is full of cats. Doorbell rings.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: Oh shit. She goes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Excuse me, missus, can you please help?
There’s been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an
ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: I’m frightfully sorry. There is a telephone
in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use
that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But, missus, this is an emergency. It’s a
matter of life and death. Me friend’s lying in the middle of the road
bleeding to death.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: I… I’m very sorry, but I never open. I’m
very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Very well, madam. I suppose you can’t be
blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the
night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where
the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round
to the rear of the house.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dim, bend down. I’m gonna get in that window
and open the front door. He climbs up drain-pipe to the bathroom
window.</p>
<p><strong>int. cadlady’s house</strong>: The Catlady enters and dials a
number.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: Hullo, Radlett Police Station. Good
evening. It’s Miss Weathers at Woodmere Health Farm. Look, I’m
frightfully sorry to bother you but something rather odd has just
happened… Well, it’s probably nothing at all, but you never know… Well,
a young man rang the bell asking to use the telephone… He said there had
been some kind of accident. The thing that caught my attention was what
he said - the words he used, sounded exactly like what was quoted in the
papers this morning in connection with the writer and his wife who were
assaulted last night… Well, just a few minutes ago… Well, if you think
that’s necessary, but, well, I’m quite sure he’s gone away now. Oh…
alright. Fine. Thank you very much. Thank you. She puts phone down,
turns and nearly jumps out of her leotard when she sees Alex in the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: What the bloody hell d’you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was
not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: Now listen here, you little bastard, just
you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex
eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside
him.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old
soomaka.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: No! No! Don’t touch it. That’s a very
important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You see, madam, I am part of an international
student’s contest to see who can get the most points for selling
magazines.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here
before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant
phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing
up and down an eccentric motion.</p>
<p><strong>catlady</strong>: I told you to leave it alone. Now get out
of here before I throw you out, wretched slummy bedbug. I’ll teach you
breaking into real people’s houses. Get out! She grabs up a bust of
Beethoven and rushes at Alex. He grabs the giant phallic sculpture.
Circling, Alex fends off her mad rushes with skilful jabs of the giant
phallus. She ducks under and clobbers him with the heavy bust of
Beethoven. He goes down, pulling her off balance and they both wind up
the floor. In the struggle, Alex bashes her with the phallus. Distant
Police sirens. He exits.</p>
<p><strong>ext. catlday’s house - night</strong>: Alex rushes out. Dim
and the others are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come on. Let’s go, the police are coming.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the
face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away,
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You bastards… bastards.</p>
<p><strong>int. police hq - night</strong>: Inspector takes out
cigarette and lights up.</p>
<p><strong>inspect</strong>: Right. Right , Tom, we’ll have to our
little friend, Alex, here that we know the law, too, but that knowing
the law isn’t everything. He nods to Fatneck.</p>
<p><strong>fatneck</strong>: That’s a nasty cut you’ve got there, little
Alex. Spoils… all your beauty. Who gave you that then… eh… eh… He
presses Alex’s nose, inflicting great pain. Alex sinks to his knees.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ow… what’s that for, you bastard?</p>
<p><strong>fatneck</strong>: That was for your lady victim. You ghastly
wretched scoundrel. Alex grabs his balls. Alex is beaten by the other
Cop. Inspector exits to outside office where Sergeant sits, sipping a
cup of tea. Deltoid has just entered.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Ah, good evening, Mr. Deltoid.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Evening, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Would you like your tea now, sir?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: No, thank you, Sergeant. We’ll have it
later. May I have some paper towels, please.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: We’re interrogating the prisoner now.
Perhaps you’d care to come inside.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Thank you very much They move into
Interrogation Room. Alex is on the floor in the corner covered with
blood.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Evening, Sergeant. Evening, all. Dear,
dear, this boy does look a mess, doesn’t he? Just look at the state of
him.</p>
<p><strong>fatneck</strong>: Love’s young nightmare like.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Violence makes violence. He resisted his
lawful arrestors.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: Well, it’s happened, Alex boy, yes. Just as
I thought it would, yes. Dear, dear, dear. Well, this is the end of the
line for me… the end of the line, yes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It wasn’t me, brother, sir. Speak up for me,
sir, for I’m not so bad. I was led on by the treachery of others,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Sings the roof off lovely, he does
that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And where are my stinking traitorous droogs.
Get them before the get away. It was all their idea, brothers. They
forced me to do it. I’m innocent.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: You are now a murderer, little Alex. A
murderer, yes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock.
She was breathing, I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: I’ve just come back from the hospital. Your
victim has died.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir.
This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.</p>
<p><strong>deltoid</strong>: It will be your own torture. I hope to God
it will torture you to madness.</p>
<p><strong>fatneck</strong>: If you’d care to give him a bash in the
chops, sir. Don’t mind us. We’ll hold him down. He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir. Deltoid spits in Alex’s face.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This is the real weepy and like tragic part of
the story beginning, O my brothers and only friends. After a trial with
judges and a jury, and some very hard words spoken against your friend
and humble narrator, he was sentenced to 14 years in Staja No. 84F among
smelly perverts and hardened prestoopnicks, the shock sending my dadda
beating his bruised and kroovy rookas against unfair Bog in his Heaven,
and my mom, boohoohooing in her mother’s grief as her only child and son
of her bosom, like letting everybody down real horrorshow.</p>
<p><strong>int. prison check-in room - day</strong>: A bell rings and a
Warder goes and unlocks first a wooden door and then a barred door.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Morning. One up from Thames, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>warder</strong>: One in from Thames, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. Open up, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>warder</strong>: Yes, sir. He opens door and steps back. Alex
and another Warden move to Reception desk.</p>
<p><strong>warder</strong>: Good morning, sir. Committal sheet.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Thank you, Mister. He signs sheet.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alexander de Large.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and
from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alexander de Large, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Crime?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Murder, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister.
The cuffs are removed.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: You are now 655321 and it is your duty
to memorise that number. He hands clipboard back to Warder.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Thank you Mister. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>warder</strong>: Thank you, chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Let the officer out. Officer exits.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. Empty your pockets! Alex moves
to desk and leans forward.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Are you able to see that white line
painted on the floor directly behind you, 655321?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Then your toes belong on the other side
of it!!!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of
chocolate on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Pick that up and put it down properly.
Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of
keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball
pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address
book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal
wristlet watch, “Timawrist” on a white metal expanding bracelet.
Anything else in your pockets?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. Sign here for your valuable
property. Alex signs.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: The chocolate and cigarettes you
brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the
table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard
moves to table with his clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Now then, were you in Police custody
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One jacket - blue pinstripe.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Prison custody?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir On remand, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One neck tie - blue.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Religion?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: C of E, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Do you mean Church of England?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Brown hair, is it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fair hair, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Blue eyes?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Blue eyes, yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Do you wear eye glasses or contact
lenses?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One shirt - blue, collar attached.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One pair of boots - black leather,
zippered, worn.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Have you ever had any mental
illness?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Do you wear any false teeth or false
limbs?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One pair of trousers - blue
pinstriped.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Have you ever had any attacks of
fainting or dizziness?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One pair of socks - black.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Are you an Epileptic?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: One pair of underpants - white with blue
waistband.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Are you now, or ever have been, a
homosexual?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. The mothballs, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>check-in</strong>: Mothballs, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and
touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex’s anus with a penlight.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Mmmmmmm… any venereal disease?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Crabs?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Lice?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Through there for a bath.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. prison chapel - day</strong>: Priest in pulpit big rough
state-proper type. Convict audience. Alex sits apart tending an overhead
projector.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I ask you friends. What’s it going to be
then? Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this? Or more in
then out for most of you? Or are you going to attend the divine word and
realise the punishment that awaits unrepentant sinners in the next world
as well as this. A lot of Idiots you are, selling your birthright for a
saucer of cold porridge. The urge to live easy. I ask you friends, is it
worth it? When we have undeniable proof - yes, my friends,
incontrovertible evidence that Hell exists. I know, I know, my friends.
I have been informed in visions that there is a place darker than any
prison, hotter than any human flame of fire, where unrepentant
criminals, sinners like yourselves… A convict burps. All laugh.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Don’t you laugh, damn you, don’t you laugh.
I say like yourselves - scream in endless and unendurable agony. Their
nostrils choked with the smell of filth, their mouths crammed with
burning ordure. Their skins rotting and peeling. A fireball spinning in
their screaming guts. I know… oh yes, I know. A convict lets rip some
lip music - prrrrrrrp. There is laughter. Chief Guard moves forward -
points.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: I saw you, 920537. I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Up yours, mate.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Just you wait, 744678. One on the
turnip coming up for you.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Quiet, my friends. Quiet. Quiet, I say. We
will now sing Hymn 2in the Prisoner’s Hymnal. Piano starts up and Alex
starts up overhead projector which displays the words of the hymn.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Show a little reverence, you bastards.
Quiet! Convicts and all start to sing.</p>
<p><strong>singing</strong>: I was a wandering sheep. I did not
love…</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Sing up damn you. Louder, sing up.</p>
<p><strong>singing</strong>: … the fold I did not love my shepherd’s
voice. I would not be controlled.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Come on, sing up, damn you.</p>
<p><strong>singing</strong>: I was a wayward child I did not love my
home I did not love my father’s voice I loved afar to roam.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It had not been edifying, indeed not, being in
this hell hole and human zoo for two years now, being kicked and
tolchocked by brutal warders, and meeting leering criminals and perverts
ready to dribble all over a lucious young malchick like your
story-teller.</p>
<p><strong>int. priest’s library - day</strong>: Alex reading the
Bible.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was my rabbit to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service. He was a bolshy great burly bastard, but he was
very fond of myself, me being very young, and also now very interested
in the big book. Priest walks by and nods pleasantly.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It had been arranged by the prison charlie, as
part of my further education to read him the Bible. I didn’t so much
like the latter part of the book which is more like all preachy talking,
than fighting and the old in-out. I liked the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchock each other and then drink their Hebrew vino and, then
getting on to the bed with their wives’ handmaidens. That kept me
going.</p>
<p><strong>bible fantasy - fighting - day</strong>: Biblical fighting
shot. Alex slashing away. Blood spurting.</p>
<p><strong>handmaiden fantasy in tent - day</strong>: Alex lying with
three semi-nude handmaidens.</p>
<p><strong>ext. biblical street</strong>: Christ being whipped on by
Alex, dressed as a Legionary.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Move on there. Move on.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I read all about the scourging and the
crowning with thorns and all that, and I could viddy myself helping in
and even taking charge of the tolchocking and the nailing in, being
dressed in the height of Roman fashion.</p>
<p><strong>back to the library</strong>: Alex sits with his eyes closed.
Priest comes over and squeezes his shoulder. Alex looks up at him and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire
to be with them, because their minds studieth robberies and their lips
speak deceits.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: If thou lose hope being weary in the days of
distress, thy strength shall be diminished.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Fine, my boy, fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Father, I have tried, have I not?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You have, my son.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve done my best, have I not?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And, Father, I’ve never been guilty of any
institutional infractions, have I?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You certainly have not, 655321. You’ve been
very helpful, and you’ve shown a genuine desire to reform.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Father - may I ask you a question in
private?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there
something troubling you, my son? Don’t be shy to speak up. Remember, I
know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of
women.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No Father. It’s nothing like that, Father.
It’s about this new thing they’re all talking about. About this new
treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you
never get back in again.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Where did you hear about this? Whose been
talking about these things?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: These things get around, Father. Two Warders
talk as it might be, and somebody can’t help overhearing what they say.
Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the
newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new
treatment, Father?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I take it you are referring to the Ludovico
Technique?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t know what it’s called, Father, all I
know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get
in again.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: That’s not proven, 655321. In fact, it is
only in the experimental stage at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But it is being used, isn’t it, Father?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It has not been used yet in this prison. The
Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very
serious dangers involved.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t care about the danger, Father. I just
want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of
goodness.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The question is weather or not this
technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness
is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t understand about the whys and
wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Be patient, my son, and put your trust in
the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and
shall give delight to thy soul.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Amen. They cross themselves.</p>
<p><strong>ext. prison yard - day</strong>: Prisoners walking in
circles.</p>
<p><strong>int. prison corridor</strong>: Guards stand either side of
cell doors. Chief Guard with Governor, Minister and entourage.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Mister.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All present and correct, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. All present and correct,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Leave to carry on, sir, please?</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Carry on, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>ext. prison yard</strong>: Chief Guard comes out of door.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right, pay attention. I want you in two
lines. Up against that wall facing this way. Go on move! Hurry up about
it and stop talking. The men line up. Chief Guard moves back to door and
comes to attention.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Ready for inspection, sir. He stands
back and salutes as Governor, Minister and entourage enter and walk
along line of men.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: How many to a cell?</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Four in this block, sir.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Cram criminals together and what do you
get - concentrated criminality… crime in the midst of punishment.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I agree, sir. What we need are larger
prisons. More money.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Not a chance, my dear fellow. The
Ggovernment can’t be concerned any longer with outmoded penological
theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political
offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely
curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that’s all. Full implementation
in a year’s time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that…
they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they
pass by.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re absolutely right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Shut your bleedin’ hole!!!</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I did, sir.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: What crime did you commit.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The accidental killing of a person, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: He brutally murdered a woman, sir, in
furtherence of theft. 14 years… sir!</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Excellent. He’s enterprising, aggressive,
outgoing. Young. Bold. Viscous. He’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Well, fine… we could still look at
C-Block.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: No, no, no. That’s enough. He’s perfect. I
want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be
transformed out of all recognition.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you very much for this chance, sir.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Let’s hope you make the most of it, my
boy.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Shall we go to my office?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>int. governor’s office - day</strong>: Governor seated at his
desk. There is a knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Come in. Door opens. Chief Guard enters
with Alex.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Sir, 655321, sir.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to
Alex.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Forward to the white line, toes behind
it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alexander de Large, sir. 655321, sir. The
Governor takes off his glasses.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I don’t suppose you know who that was this
morning, do you? That was no less a personage than the Minister of the
Interior and what they call a very new broom. Well, these new ridiculous
ideas have come at last, and orders are orders, though I may say to you
in confidence that I do not approve. An eye for an eye, I say, if
someone hits you, you hit back, do you not? Why then should not the
State very severely hit by you brutal offenders not hit back also? But
the new view is to say no. The new view is that we turn the bad into
good. All of which seems to be grossly unjust. Hmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to
this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the
Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave
State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect
pleases you?</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Answer when the Governor asks you a
question you filthy young swine!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. I’ve
done my best here I really have, sir. I’m very grateful to all
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Sign this - where it’s marked. Alex turns
the paper to read it.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Don’t read it - sign it!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: It says that you are willing to have the
residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs.
Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last “i” and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico
Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad
having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you
leave a place you’ve like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the
way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor
stands.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning,
sir, I’m Chief Officer Barnes. I’ve got 655321 on a transfer from
Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Good morning, we’ve been expecting you. I’m
Dr. Alcott. Chief Guard checks the name from his clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Yes, Dr. Alcott. Are you prepared to
accept the prisoner, sir?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Well, I wonder if you’d mind signing
these transfer documents, sir. Doctor signs.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: Thank you, sir. There, sir… there, and
there, sir… and there. Thank you, sir. Prison escort move forward. Halt.
Excuse me, sir. Is that the officer that is to take charge of the
prisoner, sir? Doctor nods. Officer steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>chief guard</strong>: If I might offer a word of advice, Doc.
You’ll have to watch this one. A right brutal bastard he has been, and
will be again. In spite all his sucking up to the prison Chaplain and
reading the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh, I think we can manage things. Charlie,
will you show the young man to his room now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Right, sir. Come this way, please. Alex
exits with Officer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Good morning, Alex, my name is
Dr. Branom. I’m Doctor Brodsky’s assistant.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Indeed it is. May I take this She
removes his tray.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: How’re you feeling this morning?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fine… fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Good. In a few minutes, you’ll meeting
Dr. Brodsky and we’ll begin your treatment. You’re a very lucky boy to
have been chosen.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I realise all that, Missus, and I’m very
grateful to all concerned.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: We’re going to friends now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into
the medicine vial.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What’s the hypo for then? Going to send me to
sleep?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Oh no, nothing of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Vitamins will it be then?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Something like that. You are a little
undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll
over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them
half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in
the bum.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What exactly is the treatment here going to be
then?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: It’s quite simple really. Were just
going to show you some films.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You mean like going to the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, that’s good. I like to viddy the old
films now and again.</p>
<p><strong>int. audio visual ludovico centre - day</strong>: Auditorium
setting. Alex is bound in a examination chair in front of a large video
screen. A white-coated Technician is strapping Alex’s head to a medical
device. He then carefully attaches the eyelid locking to Alex’s
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And viddy films I would. Where I was taken to,
brothers, was like no cine I’d been in before. I was bound up in a
straight-jacket and my gulliver was strapped to a headrest with like
wires running away from it. Then they clamped like lidlocks on my eyes
so I could not shut them no matter how hard I tried. It seemed a bit
crazy to me, but I let them get on with what they wanted to get on with.
If I was to be a free young malchick in a fortnight’s time, I would put
up with much in the meantime, my brothers. At the back of the auditorium
are ten or fifteen solemn medical Professionals in white coats watching
the proceedings and occasionally taking notes. A film begins showing on
the screen. The Technician drops eyedrops into Alex’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>violence film</strong>: Man being beaten by four toughs
wearing white. Punches, kicks, grunts, blood.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: So far the first film was a very good
professional piece of cine, looked like it was done in Hollywood.
Screams, moans, kicks, punches.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The sounds were real horroshow. You could
slooshy the screams and moans very realistic and you could even get the
heavy breathing and panting of the tolchocking malchicks at the same
time. And then, what do you know, soon our dear old friend, the red, red
vino on tap. The same in all places like it’s put out by the same big
firm, began to flow. It was beautiful. It’s funny how the colours of the
real world only seem really real when you viddy them on a screen. More
kicks, punches, groans, thumps. Girl being beaten, raped by six toughs.
Screams, music, laughing, grunts, heavy breathing.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Now all the time I was watching this, I was
beginning to get very aware of like not feeling all that well, but I
tried to forget this, concentrating on the next film, which jumped right
away on a young devotchka, who was being given the old in-out, in-out,
first by one malchick, then another, then another. This seemed real,
very real, though if you thought about it properly you couldn’t imagine
lewdies actually agreeing to having all this done to them in a film, and
if these films were made by the good, or the State, you couldn’t imagine
them being allowed to take these films, without like interfering with
what was going on. Girl being raped.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: When it came to the sixth or seventh malchick,
leering and smecking and then going into it, I began to feel really
sick. But I could not shut my glazzies and even if I tried to move my
glazballs about I still not get out of the line of fire of this picture.
Alex squirming and retching. Dr. Brodsky clears his throat and quietly
addresses his colleagues seated in the back of the room.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: Very soon now the drug will cause the
subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep
feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects
described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and
it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most
rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and
environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and
struggling against his strait jacket.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me be sick… I want to get up. Get me
something to be sick in… Stop the film… Please stop it… I can’t stand it
any more. Stop it please… please.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Well, that was a very promising start.
By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes?
Dr. Brodsky’s pleased with you. Now tomorrow there’ll be two sessions,
of course, morning and afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one
day?</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: I imagine you’ll be feeling a little bit
limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to
be cured.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But it was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Well, of course, it was horrible.
Violence is a very horrible thing. That’s what you’re learning now. Your
body is learning it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I just don’t understand about feeling sick the
way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the
very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real
horrorshow. I just don’t understand why, how what.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: You felt ill this afternoon because
you’re getting better. You see, when we’re healthy we respond to the
presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You’re becoming healthy
that’s all. By this time tomorrow you’ll be healthier still.</p>
<p><strong>int. audio visual ludovico centre - day</strong>: Alex
retching and screaming - restrained again by a straight-jacket.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was the next day, brothers, and I had truly
done my best, morning and afternoon, to play it their way and sit like a
horrorshow co- operative malchick in the chair of torture, while they
flashed nasty bits of ultra-violence on the screen.; though not on the
soundtrack, my brothers. The only sound being music. Then I noticed in
all my pain and sickness what music it was that like cracked and boomed.
It was Ludwig van - 9th symphony, 4th movement.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Stop it… stop it, please!!! I beg of you!!!
It’s a sin!!! It’s a sin!!! It’s a sin, please!!! Brodsky leans forward
and turns down the sound.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: What’s all this about sin?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That!… Using Ludwig van like that! He did no
harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: Are you referring to the background
score?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: You’ve heard Beethoven before?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: You’re keen on music?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. branom</strong>: What do you think about that,
Dr. Brodsky?</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: It can’t be helped. Here’s your
punishment element perhaps. The Governor ought to be pleased… I’m sorry,
Alex, this is for your own good, you’ll have to bear with us for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You needn’t take it any further, sir. You’ve
proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and
terribly wrong. I’ve learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I’ve never
seen before I’m cured, praise Bog!</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: You’re not cured yet, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: You must take your chance boy. The
choice has been all yours.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: But, Sir… Missus… I see that it’s wrong! It’s
wrong because it’s like against like society. It’s wrong because
everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked
and knifed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. brodsky</strong>: No, no, boy. You really must leave it
to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you’ll be
a free man.</p>
<p><strong>int. auditorium - day</strong>: VIP audience including
Minister, Junior Minister, Prison Governor, Priest, Dr. Branom,
Dr. Brodsky. Dressed in street clothes Alex enters led by a white-coated
Technician. He is led onto stage and left standing there, blinking into
lights. The Minister rises and walks to the front of the auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point, we
introduce the subject himself. He is, as you will perceive, fit and well
nourished. He comes straight from as night’s sleep and a good breakfast,
undrugged, unhypnotized. Tomorrow, we send him with confidence out into
the world again, as decent a lad as you would meet on a May morning.
What a change is here, Ladies and Gentlemen, from the wretched hoodlum
the state committed to unprofitable punishment some two years ago,
unchanged after two years. Unchanged, do I say - not quite. Prison
taught him a false smile, the rubbed hands of hypocrisy, the fawning,
greased, obsequious leer. Other vices prison taught him as well as
confirming him in those he had long practised before. Our party promised
to restore law and order and to make the streets safe for the ordinary
peace loving citizen. This pledge is now about to become a reality.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is an historic moment. The problem of
criminal violence is soon to be a thing of the past. But enough of words
- act He returns to his seat and leans close to his Junior Minister.</p>
<p><strong>junior minister</strong>: Our necks are out a long way on
this, Minister.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: I have complete faith in Brodsky. If the
polls are right, we have nothing to lose. Lights are dimmed. Enter
Lardface, an elegantly dressed fag.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don’t wash
much do you, judging by the horrible smell.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: Oh, he had a shower this morning. You
trying to call me a liar?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, brother. What d’you want?</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: What do I want?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry, brother. I didn’t mean any offence.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: Oh. Oh, you’re sorry are you, well you
must think I’m awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why did you do that, brother? I’ve never done
wrong to you.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: You want to know why I did that, well you
see - I do that… He stamps on Alex’s foot.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: … and this… He pulls Alex’s nose.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: … and that… He pulls Alex’s ear, pushes
him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: … because I don’t like you horrible type,
do I, and if you want to start something… if you want to start… go on…
well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: You’re gonna be sick are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I wanna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: You wanna be sick?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me get up.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: You wanna get up? Well, you’ve gotta you
see… well I want you to lick it. Go on… Lick it. Alex, gagging and
coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: … And again… Go on!!! Again! There’s a
good boy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And, O my brothers, would you believe your
faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a
mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing
sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling
I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Enough! That will do very well. Thank you.
Lardface does leading-man-bows. A smattering of applause.</p>
<p><strong>lardface</strong>: Thank you very much, Ladies and Gentlemen…
Thank you. Alex on floor - still retching. A beautiful nude Girl enters.
Alex looks up slowly.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: She came towards me with the light like it was
the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into
my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the
floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the
sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and
now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Thank you very much. Thank you my dear.
Girl bows and exits to loud applause.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Not feeling too bad now are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, sir, I feel really great.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and
Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by
paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently
is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter
these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude.
Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Choice! The boy has no real choice, has he?
Self interest, fear of physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of
self abasement. Its insincerity was clearly to be seen. He ceases also
to be a creature capable of moral choice.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Padre, these are subtleties. We are not
concerned with motive, with the higher ethics; we are concerned only
with cutting down crime. And with relieving the ghastly congestion in
our prisons… He will be your true Christian, ready to turn the other
cheek. Ready to be crucified rather than crucify, sick to the very heart
at the thought even of killing a fly. Reclamation, joy before the angels
of God. The point is that it works! Applause.</p>
<p><strong>ext. flatblock</strong>: Alex walking carrying his prison
parcel wrapped in brown paper.</p>
<p><strong>int. alex’s flat</strong>: Ma, Pa and Joe the Lodger reading
newspapers. Headlines - all Alex. Alex enters quietly. Loud radio music
from sitting room prevents anyone from hearing him. He enters his won
room which is the first off the hall.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three
look up startled.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hullo love, how are you? Nice to see you,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Keeping fit then?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, how are you then?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well - I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Why didn’t you let us know what was happening,
son?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like… a big
surprise for you and pee.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Well, it’s a surprise all right, a bit
bewildering too.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: We’ve only just read about it in the morning
papers.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that
we’re not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s right, Dad they did a great job on my
gulliver, I’m completely reformed.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, still the same old place then, eh?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Oh, aye, aye.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, Dad, there’s a strange fella sitting on
the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Aye, that’s Joe. He… ummmm, lives here now. The
lodger. That’s what he is… he… he rents your room. Alex confronts
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable,
do you? No complaints?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ve heard about you. I know what you’ve done.
Breaking the hearts of your poor grieving parents. So you’re back?
You’re back to make a life of misery for your lovely parents, is that
it? Well, over my dead corpse you will, because you see, they’ve let me
be more like a son to them than like a lodger. Alex cocks his fist and
starts to retch violently, almost at the same moment Joe drops back on
the couch next to Em.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Joe! Joe! Don’t fight here boys! Alex burps and
retches.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, please. Do put your hand over your mouth,
it’s bloody revolting. Alex violently ill.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Well, what’s the matter lad, are you feeling
alright?</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Dad… It’s the treatment. More retching.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, it’s disgusting. It puts you off your
food.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Leave him be, Joe. It’s the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: D’you think we should do something?</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea,
son?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No thanks, Mum. It’ll pass in a minute… … What
have you done with all my own personal things?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Well. That was all took away, son, by the
Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What about Basil? Where’s my snake?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Oh well, he met with like an accident. He
passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What’s gonna happen to me then? I mean that’s
my room he’s in - there’s no denying that. This is my home also. What
suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I
mean we can’t very well just kick Joe out… Not just like that, can we? I
mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made
like an arrangement, didn’t we Joe? You see, son, Joe’s paid next
month’s rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant
just say to Joe to get out, now can we?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, there’s much more than that, though. I mean
I’ve got you two to think of. I mean you’re more like a mother and
father to me. Well, it wouldn’t be fair now, would it, for me to go off
and leave you two to the tender mercies of this young monster who’s been
like no real son at all. Look, let him go off and find a room somewhere.
Let him learn the errors of his way, and that a bad boy like he’s been
don’t deserve such a good mum and dad as he’s had.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Alright. I see how things are now. I’ve
suffered and I’ve suffered, and I’ve suffered and everybody wants me to
go on suffering.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’ve made others suffer. It’s only fair that
you should suffer proper. You know I’ve been told everything you’ve
done, sitting here at night round the family table, pretty shocking it
was to listen to. It made me real sick, a lot of it did. Now look what
you’ve gone and done to your mother. Em bursts into tears.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: So that’s the way it is then, eh? That’s the
way it is. Right, I’m leaving now, you won’t ever viddy me no more. I’ll
make my own way. Thank you very much. Let it lie heavy on your
consciences. Alex exits.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Now don’t take it like that son. Em boohoohoos,
Joe comforts her.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ambankment - day</strong>: Alex walks along the Thames
embankment still holding his paper parcel. Tramp enters. The same man
beaten by Alex and his gang earlier in the film.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can
you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches
in his pocket and gives him some money.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a
second look at Alex.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of
God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex
breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: I never forget a face! I never forget any
face, be God!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Leave me alone, brother. I’ve never seen you
before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: This is the poisonous young swine that near
done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me.
Alex breaks away again.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and
Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: They laughed at me blood and me moans. This
murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He
is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That’s it. Old Tramps
begin to beat at Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old
men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and
horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren’t do a
single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like
that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd
round Alex, shouting.</p>
<p><strong>tramps</strong>: Young hooligan… Vagabound… Kill him…
Villain… Toad… Bastard… Kick his teeth in… Near killed poor old Jack, he
did. Police move in and push off crowd.</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: Alright, stop it now.</p>
<p><strong>second policeman</strong>: Alright, stop it now. Alright!
Come on. Stop breaking the State peace. You naughty boys. Alright,
that’s enough. Alex looks up.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it
isn’t little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are
you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Impossible… I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Evidence of the old glazzies. Nothing up
our sleeves. No magic, little Alex? A job for two, who are now of job
age. The police.</p>
<p><strong>ext. country road - day</strong>: Police Landrover drives up.
Alex is pulled out by Georgie and Dim and hustled up a deserted
lane.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Come on, Alex. Come for walkies.
Hahahahaha.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come, come, my little droogies. I just don’t
get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the
past I’ve been punished.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Been punished, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve been cured.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The
Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I just don’t get this all. It was them that
went for me, brothers. You’re not on their side and can’t be. You can’t
be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days… Trying to
get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember,
Dim?</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Long time, is right. I don’t remember them days
too horrorshow. Don’t call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Enough is remembered though, little Alex.
Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie
hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head
under the water and methodically start to beat him with their
blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out,
halt-drowned,</p>
<p><strong>dim</strong>: Be viddying you some more, some time Alex.</p>
<p><strong>ext. “home” - night - heavy rain</strong>: Alex stumbles up
the road to the entrance gate.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where was I to go, who had no home and no
money. I cried for meself, Home, Home, Home. It was Home I was wanting
and it was Home I came to, brothers, not realising in the state I was
in, where I was and had been before. Alex stumbles and crawls to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - night</strong>: Mr. Alexander at his
typewriter. Julian a 6’4” - heavyweight weight-lifter lies across an
exercise bench working with bar-bells. The door bell rings.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Who on earth could that be?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I’ll see who it is. He to the door.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Yes, what is it? No reply. He opens the
door. Alex falls into the hall.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Help. Help me… Help me… Police. Julian picks
him up like a child and carries him into the living room.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And would you believe it, O my brothers and
only friends, there was your faithful Narrator being held helpless, like
a babe in arms, and suddenly realising where I was and why HOME on the
gate had looked so familiar. But I knew I was safe. I knew he would not
remember me for, in those carefree days, I and my so-called droogs wore
our maskies which were like real horrorshow disguises.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Frank, I think this young man needs
help.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened
to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes
himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off
Alex’s clothes. They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The police… The horrible ghastly Police. They
beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at
him. It becomes apparent he is insane.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: I know who you are! Isn’t it your
picture in the newspapers? Didn’t I see you this morning on the video?
Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir, that’s exactly who I am, sir… and
what I am… a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech
progresses.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Then, by God, you have been sent here
by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the
Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the
first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their
victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that
you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you’re
cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Certainly, Frank. He carries Alex off.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you very much, sir. God bless you, sir.
Alexander bites his hand.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - bathroom</strong>: Alex soaks, eyes closed, in
a hot tub. After a while he begins softly singing to himself: “Singin’
in the Rain”.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - living room - day</strong>: Mr. Alexander is
hunched over the phone, talking in hoarse whipsers. The door to the
bathroom is right behind him. While he speaks Mr. Alexander throws
nervous glances over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: I tell you, sir, they have turned
this young man into something other than a human being. He has no power
of choice any more. He’s committed to socially acceptable acts, a little
machine capable only of good… He can be the most potent weapon
imaginable to ensure that the Government is not returned at the next
election. The Government’s great boast, as you know sir, is the way they
have dealt with crime in the last few months. Recruiting brutal young
roughs into the police, proposing debilitation and will-sapping
techniques of conditioning. Oh, we’ve seen it all before in other
countries The thin end of the wedge. Before we know where we are we
shall have the full apparatus of totalitarianism. This young boy is a
living witness to these diabolical proposals. The people - the common
people - must know… must see! There are rare traditions of liberty to
defend. The tradition of liberty means all. The common people will let
it go! Oh, yes - they will sell liberty for a quieter life. That is why
they must be le Trembling with excitement and madness, Mr. Alexander
hangs up the phone. His eyes, shiny with anticipation. Then, suddenly,
he becomes aware of Alex’s voice coming from the other side of the
door.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - bathroom</strong>: Alex in bath, singing.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m singing in the rain, Just singing in the
rain…</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: His face horribly distorted in a
Homeric rage.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - night</strong>: Alex, alone, in complete
silence. Eating a large plate of spaghetti. The giant, Julian, appears,
carrying Mr. Alexander in his wheelchair. He deposits him at the
table.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It was very kind of you to leave this out for
me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started.
I hope that’s alright, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Of course. Food alright?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Great, sir. Great.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Try the wine!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the
thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Won’t you join me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: No, my health doesn’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No thank you. Alex, stalling for time,
reaches for bottle and reads the label.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: 1960, Chateau, Saint Estephe, Medoc, very good
brand, sir. He doesn’t get a penny’s change for his remarks from
Alexander and Julian. He holds the glass up to the light.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Very good colour, sir. Smells mice, too.Very
good number, sir. Very good. Here’s to it. He downs the glass.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Very refreshing, sir, very refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: I’m so pleased you appreciate good
wine. Have another glass!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: My wife… Alex freezes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: … used to do everything for me and
leave me to my writing.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: No. She’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m sorry to hear about that, sir. His face
contorted in rage.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: She was very badly raped, you see. We
were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in
this very room you’re sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The
doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later
during the ’flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I
knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly
his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: And now you, another victim of the
modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were
having a bath.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Phoned some friends, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Yes. They want to help.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Help me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Help you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who are they, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: They’re very, very important people
and they’re interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Julian. This will be these people
now. Alex gets up.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look, sir. I’m sorry to have troubled you. I
think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: No, no my boy. No trouble at all.
Alex slowly sits.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Have another glass of wine. He pours.
Alex picks up glass and takes a drink.</p>
<p><strong>int. “home” - night</strong>: Dolin and Rubinstein enter with
Julian.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Hullo, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>mr. alexander</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Frank.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: So this is the young man?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How do you do, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Hullo.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Missus. Very pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Hullo.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: I hope you forgive us for coming over at this
ungodly hour, but we heard from Frank that you were in some trouble so
we came over to see if we could be of any help.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: I understand that you had a rather
unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Much better, thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Feel like talking to us. Answering a few
questions?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fine, sir, fine.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Well, as I’ve said, we’ve heard about you. We
are interested in your case. We want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you very much, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: But first we’d like to find out a few things
about you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What would you like to know, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dolin</strong>: Well, shall we get down to it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: The newspapers mentioned that in
addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence,
you’ve inadvertently been conditioned against music.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, er, I think that was something that they
hadn’t planned for, you see, Missus, I’m very fond of music and always
have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van… Beethoven. B… E… E… He
leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: It’s alright, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And it just so happened that while they were
showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the
background music was playing Beethoven.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: So now you have the same reaction to
music as you do to sex and violence?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh well, it’s… it’s not all music you see,
Missus. It’s just the 9th.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: You mean Beethoven’s 9th Symphony?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s right. Er… I can’t listen to the 9th
any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: When you say this funny feeling, you
mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That is correct, sir. And then all I can think
about is like trying to snuff it.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Snuff it, sir… um… death, I mean, missus… Er…
I just want to die peacefully like with no… pain.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Do you feel that way now?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Um… oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very
miserable, very much down in spirits.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Do you still feel suicidal?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Um… well, put it this way… I feel very low in
myself. I can’t see much in the future, and I feel that any second
something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face
into the plate of spaghetti.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car,
will you please?</p>
<p><strong>int. hi-fi room - dawn</strong>: Alexander sits looking up.
Rubinstein, Julian and Dolin also listening to Beethoven played loudly
on tape recorder.</p>
<p><strong>int. dolin’s house - prisoner bedroom - day</strong>: The 9th
Symphony booming up through the floor. Alex slowly regains
consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I woke up. The pain and sickness all over me
like an animal. Then I realised what it was. The music coming up from
the floor was our old friend, Ludwig van and the dreaded 9th Symphony.
He staggers to the door. It is locked. He kicks and tugs the door.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Open the door… turn it off… turn it off. CUT
TO:</p>
<p><strong>the billiard room below</strong>: Hi-Fi gear laid out on the
table. Large speakers facing upwards. Mr. Alexander trembles and
twitches. He is now completely mad. The others merely wait, coolly.</p>
<p><strong>int. dolin’s house - prisoner bedroom - day</strong>: Alex on
his knees. His hands cupped over his ears, banging his head on the
floor. Then he stops and slowly straightens up, staring at the
window.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Suddenly I viddied what I had to do, and what
I had wanted to do - and that was to do myself in, to snuff it, to blast
off forever out of this wicked cruel world. One moment of pain perhaps
and then sleep - forever and ever and ever.</p>
<p><strong>ext. window - dawc</strong>: Alex leaps out of the
window.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital ward</strong>: Alex in bed. Camera slowly
tracks along length of his body. Everything is bandages and plaster
splints, wire cages, blood drips.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I jumped, O my brothers, and I fell hard but I
did not snuff it, oh no. if I had snuffed it, I would not be here to
tell what I have told. I came back to life, after a long, black, black
gap of what might have been a million years. We hear Alex moan, and then
another moan. Alex and the other - a few times. Suddenly, some curtains
which have been drawn around another bed in the ward are parted, and a
nurse hurries to Alex, hastily buttoning up her uniform. She is trailed
by a young Intern fumbling with his trousers.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Oh, he’s recovered conscienceness,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: Em and Pee sitting around the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Hullo, lad.</p>
<p><strong>em</strong>: Hullo, son, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: Are you feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you
think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.</p>
<p><strong>pee</strong>: There, there mother, it’s alright. He doesn’t
mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great
wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do
yourself in… and when you think about it, son… maybe it was our fault
too in a way… your home’s your home when it’s all said and done, son. Em
sobs.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital</strong>: Psychiatrist wheels trolley to Alex’s
bed. He is sitting up.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good morning, Missus.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fine. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. I’m doctor Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I haven’t seen you before.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: I’m your Psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Just part of hospital routine.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What are we going to do? Talk about me sex
life?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: No… I’m going to show you some slides
and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ohhh… jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me
something to me first.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half
awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these
doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know… like the inside
of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D’you
think it means anything?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Patients who’ve sustained the kind of
injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It’s all part of the
recovery process.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Now then, each of these slides needs a
reply from one of the people in the picture. You’ll tell me what you
think the person would say. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the
dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Isn’t the plumage beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I just say what the other person would
say?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Yes. Yes, well don’t think about it too
long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right… Knickers… Cabbages… It doesn’t have a
beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. The boy you always quarrelled with
is seriously ill.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s right and I’ll smash your face for you,
yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. It wa your fault… you sold me a
crummy watch. I want my money back.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Bollocks. You know what you can do with that
watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man
at the window.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out,
I’ve just come to read the meter. Slide of bird’s nest with eggs.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. You can do whatever you like with
these.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Eggiwegs. I would like to smash ’em. Pick up
th elot and f… owww… He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fucking hell…</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Fine. Well, that’s all there is to it.
Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I hope so. Is that the end then?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I was quite enjoying that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Good. I’m glad</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How many did I get right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: It’s not that kind of a test. But you
seem well on the way to a complete recovery.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And when do I get out of here then?</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: I’m sure it won’t be long now.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: Alex sitting up, being fed by
Nurse.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: So I waited and, O my brothers, I got a lot
better munching away at eggiwegs, and lomticks of toast and lovely
steakiweaks and then, one day, they said I was going to have a very
special visitor. Doctor enters followed by Minister and Matron.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Good evening, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, how are you getting on today, young
man?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Great, sir. Great.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Can I do anything more for you ,
Minister?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: I don’t think so, Sir Leslie. Thank you
very much.</p>
<p><strong>dr. taylor</strong>: Then I’ll leave you to it. Nurse. They
exit. Minister moves to Alex.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: You seem to have a whole ward to yourself,
my boy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too,
sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Yes… well good to see you on the mend.
I’ve kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I’ve
come to see you personally to see how you’re getting along.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve suffered the tortures of the damned. The
tortures of the damned, sir.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Yes I can… Oh look, let me do that for
you, shall I?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: I can tell you that I… and the Government
of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply
sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made
to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends.
We’ve put you right, you’re the best of treatments. We never wished you
harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those
are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends.
People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would
have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who
those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive
literature - who has been howling for your blood. He’s been mad with
desire to stick a knife into you, but you’re safe from him now, we’ve
put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he
believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that
you h</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where is he now, sir?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: We put him away where he can do you no
harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in
you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall
see to everything… a good job on a good salary.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What job and how much?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: You must have an interesting job at a
salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which
you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have
suffered, but also because you are helping us.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Helping you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: We always help our friends, don’t we? It
is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of
you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we
shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of
what we tried to do.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, who can blame them, sir?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion
has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Certainly, sir. What do they call you at
home?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: My name is Frederick. As I was saying,
Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you
understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an
azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Good… good boy. Oh yes, I understand
you’re fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Surprise?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: One I think you will like… as a, how shall
I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between
two friends.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and
signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in.
Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And what do you know, my brothers and only
friends, it was the 9th, the glorious 9th of Ludwig van. Oh, it was
gorgeosity and yummy yum yum. I was cured.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As the music came to its climax, I could viddy
myself very clear, running and running on like very light and mysterious
feet, carving the whole face of the creeching world with my cut throat
britva. I was cured all right.</p>
