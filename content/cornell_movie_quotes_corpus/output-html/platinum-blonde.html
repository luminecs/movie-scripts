<h1 id="platinum-blonde">platinum-blonde</h1>
<p><strong>platinum blonde</strong>: Story by Harry E. Chandlee and
Douglas W. Churchill</p>
<p><strong>- day - full shot</strong>: General atmosphere, typical of a
busy newspaper office. Copy boys running about, shirtsleeved reporters
and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters. Little wire baskets
containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such as are used
in some department stores, etc.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: bells and all other sounds relative When shot
has been fully established:</p>
<p><strong>2. close shot</strong>: On Conroy, the City Editor at his
desk, speaking on the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah, that’s all I ever get from you guys -
a lot of hard luck stories. You come back here and I’ll give you an
assignment. It will be a last interview - with the cashier!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Oh Mr. Conroy, give me a crack at that
Schuyler story, will you?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: You? If you ever got your foot into a
drawing room, you’d step on a sliding rug! Stew is the only man that’s
got brains enough to handle this. Scram!</p>
<p><strong>copy boy</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Well, did you look in the�</p>
<p><strong>copy boy</strong>: First place I looked.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Not there, eh? For cryin’ out loud, where is
that�? Go and dig him up! Stew! Stew Smith!</p>
<p><strong>camera trucks on:</strong>: Until it takes in a sort of
make-shift screen, concealing a corner of the room.</p>
<p><strong>3. close shot</strong>: On the other side of the screen. Stew
Smith is holding something in his hand. His hat tilted back on his head,
and he is regarding this plaything intently. Gallagher is sitting close
to him, also gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher is a girl, one
of the sob sisters on the newspaper, dressed in a trim but inexpensive
little tailored suit.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Here it is. Pray for me, Gallagher. Pray for
me. Hold everything . . .</p>
<p><strong>4. close shot</strong>: On the object in his hand, one of
those hand-puzzles where you have to land jumping beans in the
holes.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Stew, your hands are shaking. You’ve been
drinking again.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher!
Here they come!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: The boss is getting hoarse.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: There’s the third one. If I don’t get the last
one, there’s a certain sob sister I know that’s going to get a kick
right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.</p>
<p><strong>6. med. close shot</strong>: Conroy, the City Editor at his
desk, looking about with a scowl for Stew.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Stew! Stew Smith!</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What? The screen?</p>
<p><strong>7. close shot</strong>: On Stew Smith</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher! I made it!</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 6</strong>: A wrathy Conroy, his eyes
centering suspiciously on something. With his eyes on the screen, Conroy
reaches out and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his desk.
Still looking off, he heaves it forcefully.</p>
<p><strong>9. med. close shot</strong>: Showing the screen. The
telephone book crashes into it, overturning it and revealing Stew and
Gallagher on the other side. They both look up, startled. The newsroom
erupts in laughter.</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 6</strong>: Conroy, glaring off
fiercely.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Come over here!</p>
<p><strong>10. medium shot</strong>: Conroy at his desk. Stew saunters
into the scene.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Look, I quit!</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’re always picking on me. It took me three
hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in
a minute. Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Mmm, not as easy as it looks, is it?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Aagh! No wonder you’re batty. Would it be
imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today?
Just to sort of break the monotony?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: With me you can always do business.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Do you know what to do in a
drawing-room?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It isn’t a question of knowing what to do,
it’s knowing how to get in one that counts.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gloria Golden?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah, little Gloria.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: The human cash register. Got her hooks into
the Schuyler kid, eh?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Right - for the first time this year.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well - it’s only April.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Come on, get going, get going!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Get going where? I can write that yarn without
stepping out of the office.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Yeah - and get us into a million dollar
libel suit. It wouldn’t be the first time. Now, you get over there and
get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them
- but get it.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What expenses? All you need is carfare to
Long Island. You’d better get a shave and a shine, because you, you’re
going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors
refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn’t want to rub
elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot</strong>: Someone pacing outside the mansion
gates.</p>
<p><strong>- day - close shot</strong>: A guard dog pacing inside the
gates.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: A parrot on its perch, hopping from foot
to foot.</p>
<p><strong>- close shot</strong>: Michael Schuyler, a callow youth with
the usual dissipated, spoiled look. His fingers are nipping out little
chunks of a folded piece of paper, dropping the bits on the floor. This
is indicative of a habit of the individual in question when undergoing
nervous stress. He is very fidgety and apprehensive, as he glances
around.</p>
<p><strong>camera pans over to show</strong>: Anne Schuyler, a beautiful
and aristocratic, though slightly hard girl, a few years older than
Michael.</p>
<p><strong>camera pans over to show</strong>: Mrs. Stuyvesand Van
Alstyne Schuyler, mother of Anne and Michael. A grande dame, stern and
glowering. Her attitude indicates suppressed nervousness and anger. She
glares over in the direction of Michael. Then she turns and looks in
another direction.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Dexter Grayson, if you were any kind
of a lawyer, you’d get those letters back!</p>
<p><strong>camera pans over to show</strong>: Dexter Grayson, the family
lawyer standing, his hands clasped behind his back, just completing the
pacing of a few short steps in his best courtroom manner, his head bowed
in an attitude of deepest thought. He is dressed in striped afternoon
trousers and black coat. He turns to regard Mrs. Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: But I keep telling you how difficult it is,
Mrs. Schuyler. The last time I asked her for those letters, she made
very uncouth noises with her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>camera pans over to show</strong>: Anne Schuyler, trying
desperately to keep from laughing.</p>
<p><strong>camera draws back</strong>: To reveal a full shot of the room
and group. They are in the magnificent drawing room of the Schuyler
home, resembling the Union Depot and furnished with almost imperial
splendor and magnificence. They very much resemble a jury in session. As
they continue:</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know why you’re making all this
fuss. I only sent her six of them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: If you had to make a fool of
yourself, why didn’t you tell it to her instead of writing?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Because I couldn’t get her on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You should have known better than to write,
Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: I should say you had. At the rate you
two are going, we’ll have to leave the country to save our faces.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Splendid, Mother. Let’s hop over to Monte
Carlo. It’s a great place to save a face.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Oh, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: What is it, Smythe?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to
the newspapermen?</p>
<p><strong>17. closer shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She
rises and speaks imperiously:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Dexter, go out and tell those
ruffians I have nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: You can’t do that. Leave it to me. I know
how to handle reporters.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: All right, then - get it over
with.</p>
<p><strong>18. medium full shot</strong>: Grayson turns officiously
toward the waiting butler.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: We’ve decided to see the reporters. Send in
the man from the Tribune first.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda,
quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels will upset me.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I’ve anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate
is ready.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: This room resembles the Grand Central Station.
It is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and
special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and
luxury.</p>
<p><strong>20. closer shot</strong>: Bingy, as he lingers at the table.
He is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face needs a shave and his pants
need pressing. There is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie. On the table
is a humidor. Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful of cigars.</p>
<p><strong>21. close shot - stew</strong>: As he looks up from the book,
he suggests:</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hey Bingy, you’ll find the silverware in the
dining room.</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 20</strong>: Bingy turns, putting the
cigars in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Much obliged.</p>
<p><strong>22. medium full shot</strong>: Smythe enters.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Mr. Grayson has decided to see you.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: The gentleman from the Tribune, first.</p>
<p><strong>23. closer three shot</strong>: Bingy beams broadly and Stew
is disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I understand, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my
boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and
read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Couldn’t make the last edition. It’d take me
four hours to translate your story into English.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, is that so?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Hey, make up your mind, will you?</p>
<p><strong>- medium close shot</strong>: By the door which leads out
into the hall. The butler enters and stops, standing stiffly. Bingy
enters behind him, shambling awkwardly. He stops in some consternation
as he sees:</p>
<p><strong>25. medium shot</strong>: The Schuyler jury. Grayson,
Mrs. Schuyler, Anne and Michael, all surveying him in varying degrees of
unfriendliness.</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 24</strong>: Bingy hesitates uneasily as
he regards this impressive assemblage. Quickly, he takes his hat back
off. Then he smiles nervously and starts forward.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Hi, folks!</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 25</strong>: Grayson comes forward to
meet him, attempting to be very cordial. Bingy is seized by a sudden
impulse to sneeze. He does so, violently. There is awkward silence.
Mrs. Schuyler throws off a visible shudder.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: What’s the matter? Isn’t there a ‘bless you’
in the crowd?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: You’re the Tribune man?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Yeah, hello. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Fine. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Thanks, I will.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, man!</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, boy!</p>
<p><strong>26. medium close shot</strong>: Bingy and Grayson. Grayson
picks up a very flossy and expensive cigarette box from the small end
table beside the chair. It is made of gold and semi-precious stones are
inset in the cover. Grayson opens the lid and takes out a cigarette, but
pointedly does not offer one to Bingy.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Fine newspaper the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Well, I should say!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I knew your managing editor very well.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Yale ’21, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: We were classmates.</p>
<p><strong>27. close shot - mrs. schuyler</strong>: She clears her
throat menacingly, as she looks sternly at Grayson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Ahem!</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: What’s the matter? She got a cold?</p>
<p><strong>continuation, scene 26</strong>: Bingy and Grayson. Both look
over. Grayson gives her a quick reassuring glance, as though to say
“leave it to me now.” He continues his conversation with the
reporter.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I got him his job on the paper. I’m a
stock-holder, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: As one Tribune man to another�</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: But right now I’m acting in the capacity of
Mrs. Schuyler’s attorney.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, that’s all right with me. I won’t hold it
against you. But you see, I’m here to find out about�</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I know, I know. But there’s no truth in the
story whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>28. medium shot</strong>: Grayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy
by the arm and leads him over to a corner of the room, assuming a
confidential pose.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: However, I’ve taken the trouble to prepare
a little statement. Here it is. Here.</p>
<p><strong>29. closer two shot</strong>: Grayson and Bingy. Grayson
takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Bingy. Bingy opens
the flap and sees the contents.</p>
<p><strong>insert: envelope</strong>: The corner of a fifty dollar bill
protrudes.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up.
Grayson is watching him closely.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: So, you see how silly that rumor is?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Why, sure. It’s a lotta hooey.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: That’s what I wanted to say, but I couldn’t
think of it.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: All right, all right, don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Give my regards to your managing
editor.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: I certainly will.</p>
<p><strong>30. medium shot from his angle</strong>: The Schuylers all
sitting silently and contemplating him.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Well, so long folks!</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Uh, bless you!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Bless you!</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: So long!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Smythe, bring in the other reporter.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>full shot</strong>: The group awaiting the advent of the Post
reporter. Stew is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book
in his hand. They give him the once-over. Mrs. Schuyler raises her
lorgnette with a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them with animation, not
in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. He starts
toward them.</p>
<p><strong>32. medium shot</strong>: As Stew approaches them.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Schuyler’s the name, I presume? Yes, thank
you, thank you. My name’s Smith - Stewart Smith. No relation to John,
Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can’t have everything.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Nice set of Conrads you have out there,
Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What’s Michael
tearing the paper about?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out
by all the rumors going around.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a
breach-of-promise case a rumor?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: No breach-of-promise case has been filed.
The matter has been settled out of court.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh I see, but Gloria doesn’t seem to be
satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>34. a medium shot of group</strong>: At this, Mrs. Schuyler
rises wrathfully.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Dexter Grayson, you told me it was
only ten thousand�and you didn’t even get those letters from that
Jezebel!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars,
eh? and there are letters . . .</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor
class, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: We admit nothing. However, I have a little
statement all prepared.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: A statement? Good.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I have it here.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Fifty bucks, eh?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Don’t you know you should never offer a
newspaper man more than two dollars? If you do, he’ll think it’s
counterfeit. I don’t need fifty dollars. As a matter of fact, I’ve got
fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly
satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw
fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny
thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks
stupid, doesn’t he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a
typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>36. medium shot</strong>: Schuyler group - taking his action
with dismay. Stew starts walking back toward them, talking as he walks,
Grayson beside him, considerably distracted.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: So ten grand was the amount you gave the girl?
Any other statement you folks would like to make?</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: That’s not so!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute. Don’t get excited. I wouldn’t
worry about it. A little publicity never hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>37. close shot - mrs. schuyler</strong>: She is on the point
of an apopletic stroke. She advances menacingly toward Stew. She calls
to Grayson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Dexter, have this person leave
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>38. medium shot - the group</strong>: Stew is not at all
perturbed. Dexter takes him by the arm and starts to lead him out.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I think you’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Go?! Wait a minute - that’s a great story!
Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Wait a minute�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t mind Mother.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I don’t mind her if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 37</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler, almost choking
in her wrath at this outrageous stranger.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Anne!</p>
<p><strong>39. close shot - anne and stew</strong>: Anne stifles a smile
at this cheerful insolence.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m sure you’re quite willing to be decent
about this.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be
noble.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re not going to print this silly thing,
are you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Because my name’s Schuyler too. And I haven’t
done a thing, but I’ll suffer with Michael. And so will Mother.</p>
<p><strong>40. closeup - stew</strong>: He has been listening to this
and enjoying it immensely. He looks over at Mrs. Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Mother’s suffering already!</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 39</strong>: Anne, not wanting to lose her
point, looks up at Stew pleadingly.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: As a special favor to me, you won’t print that
story, will you?</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 40</strong>: Stew, looking down at her in
frank approval and admiration.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Please�</p>
<p><strong>42. medium shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and
Grayson. All watching the couple intently, hanging on the next
words�wondering if Anne is going to succeed. They are tense and
expectant.</p>
<p><strong>43. close shot - anne and stew</strong>: He is looking down
into her soft, melting eyes. Then he smiles.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You know something, lady, if you sold life
insurance, I’d go for a policy in sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, thank you, I knew you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 42</strong>: The three. They relax and
exchange relieved and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne has won.</p>
<p><strong>44. medium shot - entire group</strong>: Stew turns
aside.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: May I use your telephone?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Certainly. Right over there.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Beekman 1300? That’s an unlucky number.
You know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>45. close shot - stew</strong>: At the telephone. He turns
back to the instrument as he gets his connection.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give me Conroy.
He isn’t? Try the washroom, will you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other day -
Einstein. Swell guy, a little eccentric, but swell. Doesn’t wear any
garters. Neither do I as a matter of fact. What good are garters
anyway�?</p>
<p><strong>stew’s voice</strong>: Yes, it’s easy to see where her beauty
comes from. From her mother.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 45</strong>: Stew at the phone</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep your
shirt on. I’m coming to that. The Schuylers admit the story is true.
Right. They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. But she’s got some letters
- and she’s holding out for more dough - and it looks to me like she’s
going to get it.</p>
<p><strong>47. medium shot - schuyler group</strong>: Horrified and
shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Right boss. I’ll be right over. Right - no, I
don’t think I can get any pictures now. Right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Oh-h-h . . .!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’ve met some rotters in my time, but without
a doubt, you’re the lowest excuse for a man I’ve ever had the misfortune
to meet�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, if you feel that way about it, here’s a
nickel for the phone call.</p>
<p><strong>fade out:</strong>: ? 20 ?</p>
<p><strong>fade in: day</strong>: INSERT: Dingy board sign outside a
building.</p>
<p><strong>lap dissolve to:</strong>: INSERT: Three column heading in
newspaper:</p>
<p><strong>suit for $10,000.</strong>: Gloria Golden, Follies
Beauty,</p>
<p><strong>48. medium full shot</strong>: A reasonably respectable
speakeasy, smoke-filled. Quite a number of men and a few women are
leaning on the bar and seated around at the tables. Stew and Gallagher
are seated at one of the rude round tables, smoking, drinks before them.
Gallagher is reading the newspaper story.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: �and she walked up to me and put her hand on
my shoulder and said, ‘Mr. Smith, You wouldn’t print that story, would
you?’ Oh no, I wouldn’t print it - read it!</p>
<p><strong>50. close shot - gallagher</strong>: Over Stew’s shoulder.
She laughs at his attempted imitation.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: You’re sure going to be poison to that
Junior Leaguer from now on!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I hope not . . . I’ve got to call on her this
morning!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her
wounds need soothing.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Stew, are you
completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can’t go
back there.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, the story is cold, but I’m not. I’m
sizzling - look! Psst!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: O-o-oh! Came the dawn, came the dawn!</p>
<p><strong>51. close shot - stew</strong>: Over Gallagher’s
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you’ve
got to meet her. She’s it�</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: �and that�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: �and those and them.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Well, I’ve seen her pictures, and I don’t
think she’s so hot.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, you don’t appreciate it. Her pictures
don’t do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she’s queenly - she is queenly -
and I know queens! And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses
too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she
cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Of course I haven’t got a nose.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, sure. You’ve got a nose, Gallagher.
You’ve got a nose. But there’s different women, Gallagher. You know,
like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: On now, Stew, don’t be too hard on her. I
wouldn’t call her a brewery horse.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher! She’s the real McCoy!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: And the rest of us are truck horses?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: There you go, talking like a woman!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, you’re my pal, aren’t you? Then don’t
turn female on me.</p>
<p><strong>53. medium shot</strong>: Stew seems a little resentful of
her attitude. He rises.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Pay that check, will you Gallagher? I’ll give
it back to you some time. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I go now - I go with Conrad in quest of my
youth! Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher?</p>
<p><strong>54. closer shot - gallagher</strong>: Sitting, looking
dismally after Stew.</p>
<p><strong>- long shot</strong>: Smythe, the butler, previously
introduced, comes from the direction of the rear of the house, and
proceeds down the long, vast hallway towards the front door. The bell
keeps ringing steadily.</p>
<p><strong>56. closer shot</strong>: As the butler opens the door and
reveals Stew standing outside, hatless, a book in his hand, a spring
overcoat slightly askew, the pockets bulging with contents. The butler
quickly tries to slam the door in Stew’s face, but Stew’s right foot
comes forward with a practiced newspaperman’s gesture and he forces his
way into the room.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now, now Jeeves. Was that nice? Was that being
a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: The name is Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?
Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake! Now,
as a Smith to a Smythe�</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I know, I know. I waited outside till she went
out. She’s a very nice lady, but we don’t vibrate well together.</p>
<p><strong>58. medium shot</strong>: Anne, dressed in smart sports
clothes, starts to cross thru the hall. She stops as she sees the butler
engaged in conversation with Stew.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: No one’s at home, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now Jeeves, what would you call this - ‘no
one’?</p>
<p><strong>59. closer three shot</strong>: Anne looks up and sees that
the butler is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that if
this person came here again, I was to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s a good idea - telephone the police. The
number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a
rubber of bridge.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You may go, Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: But I�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now the lady said you may go�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I
had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I
still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my
hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning,
I got up and put your book in my hand, and here’s your book in your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s considerate of you.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend
you read it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m not interested in your literary
recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, maybe it’s a bit heavy for you. Perhaps
if you’d like something lighter - something with a touch of romance�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Just listen to this� Adorable Babykins�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Just a moment. I don’t see how that trash
could possibly concern me.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Ah! But you don’t know who Bobo is. And you
don’t know who Babykins is.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m not interested. Smythe will open the
door.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: But Bobo is your brother, Michael. And of
course nobody would ever guess who Babykins is.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Where did you get those letters?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins
about Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I suppose you’re going to print them?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No - give you another guess.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, I don’t need another guess. It’s quite
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: So, it’s obvious, huh?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Will you step into the library?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, I’ll take a chance.</p>
<p><strong>63. close shot</strong>: Anne at the desk, starting to fill
in the date on a blank check.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What are your initials - Mr. - er�</p>
<p><strong>64. close shot - stew</strong>: Who has remained standing. He
is watching her with a peculiar expression.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smith. Stewart Smith. My friends call me Stew.
It’s an injustice too because I hold my liquor all right.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 63</strong>: Anne writes on the check.
Then she looks up.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Will - uh - five thousand be enough?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: For the letters, of course.</p>
<p><strong>66. medium close shot</strong>: As Stew walks closer and
addreses her.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gee, you shouldn’t do that, Miss Schuyler.
That’s all right for your lawyer friend, but you shouldn’t go around
thinking you can buy people. They’re yours.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know how to thank you. Mother’ll be so
grateful - she’ll probably want to kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back
my letters. That’s the breaks I get. It’s the mothers that are always
grateful to me. Here.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re a peculiar person. Why the other day I
pleaded with you not to send in that story and �</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I know but that was news. This is blackmail
and I don’t like blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I won’t even pretend it isn’t a very great
favor. I wish there was something I could do for you�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, you could make this table a little - uh
- a little less wide. There is something you can do for me, Miss
Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I haven’t had any lunch yet. Have you got
anything in the icebox?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, you fool!</p>
<p><strong>68. med. full shot</strong>: A lovely, sunny room, cretonne
drapes and colorful painted furniture. Stew and Anne are sitting at the
table. Anne looks amused and</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: After years of research, I finally discovered
that I was the only guy in the world who hadn’t written a play, so
believe it or not, in my spare time I’m now writing a play.</p>
<p><strong>69. close two shot</strong>: Anne is casually amused.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah, I haven’t figured out the plot yet, but
it’s laid in a Siberian village.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re a bit eccentric, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me.
Only one thing wrong with me�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You don’t wear garters!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Naw, that’s just a symbol of my
independence.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m color blind. That’s what’s wrong - I’m
color blind. I’ve been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and I
don’t know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m just beginning to believe that something
could be done with you.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Say, you could do anything with me you wanted
to. Putty - just putty, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now getting back to those eyes of yours -
would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Not if you’re going to lose any sleep about
it.</p>
<p><strong>70. close shot</strong>: He gets closer, takes her chin in
his hand and gets an eyeful.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Now, how would you like them�open like
this?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Close them both. Something tells me I’d better
leave.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: That’s an excellent idea.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, hello Mother!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello - hello, Mrs. Schuyler. Come right in.
Will you have a slug of tea?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: What is this person doing here?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: As a matter of fact, I was just trying to
decide the color of Anne’s eyes. I can’t tell whether they’re blue, or
whether they’re violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Why�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t say it, Mother, please. Mr. Smith came
here today to do us a great favor.</p>
<p><strong>71. closer shot</strong>: Anne, Mrs. Schuyler and Stew.
Mrs. Schuyler, with an effort, restraining her impulse to yank Stew out
by the collar, speaks:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great
favor.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: With pleasure, Madame!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Mother!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It’s all right. It’s all right, Anne. I can
take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Please go. I’ll explain to Mother.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: The caviar was lovely, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>72. wider shot</strong>: Stew starts to the door, smiles at
Anne, and remarks to Mrs. Schuyler as he passes her:</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You must come over and see us sometime.</p>
<p><strong>73. medium shot</strong>: Anne in a stunning evening dress is
seated, a cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other. Dexter Grayson,

<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Where were you yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>74. close shot - anne</strong>: She has a faraway,
speculative look in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Yes - Sing Sing.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 74</strong>: Anne. She ignores this
crack.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Just the same, he’s going to be a different
person when I get through with him.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 75</strong>: Grayson. He is looking at
her, deeply disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: When you get through with him?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes, it’ll be a very interesting
experiment.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: To make a gentleman out of a tramp?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to
get rid of that baseball player?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You don’t seem to understand that this one’s
different. He has brains.</p>
<p><strong>77. med. close shot</strong>: Grayson seats himself beside
her on the divan.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: But what about me, Anne?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You? Oh, don’t go serious on me, Dexter.</p>
<p><strong>78. med. shot trucking</strong>: An elaborate, modernistic
roof apartment, thronged with people all in evening dress. Stew and Anne
are walking down among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily
guiding her among the stuffed shirts. Anne stops before a group. There
is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink of glasses, music from
stringed invisible orchestra, etc.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss
Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: How-di-do.</p>
<p><strong>80. close shot - group of women</strong>: They are looking
off in Anne’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: Say, who’s Anne’s new boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: Well, if these old ears don’t deceive
me, I believe his name is Smith.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: Smith! Can’t be one of the brothers -
he hasn’t a beard on.</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: Well, he must have something if Anne
has got her clutches on him.</p>
<p><strong>81. med. full shot</strong>: Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is
standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an
anaemic-looking young man. Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian
with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter bows toward the swarthy one, who
bends almost double in acknowledgement. There is a polite scattering of
applause, and some of the guests seat themselves.</p>
<p><strong>82. med. full shot</strong>: A most beautiful, romantic spot.
Rose trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a
few choice marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous
spot. Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house. The garden is
dark except for the lights from the interior of the house. From within,
comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic,
sentimental Italian love song. This will continue to the FADE OUT of the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>83. closeup - anne &amp; stew</strong>: On divan, arms around
each other.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out of
here. Give me the air. Throw me out of this joint, will you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why should I? We’re happy, aren’t we,
darling?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Throw me out - because I’m beginning to get
goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they
concern me.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have
been able to stand for the last month. I’m white, male and over
twenty-one. I’ve never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer
Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and
I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I’ve got eight
hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don’t know yet
whether your eyes are blue or violet.</p>
<p><strong>84. medium full shot</strong>: Typical atmosphere, as

being typed.</p>
<p><strong>88. close shot - gallagher</strong>: As she talks on the
phone to one of her girlfriends</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Sure I got a new dress. A new hat too.
Well, I’ll try to get Stew to come with me. Yeah - he’s all right. You
know, he thinks he’s stuck on some society gal. Naw, it won’t last. It
better not last!</p>
<p><strong>89. closer shot - conroy</strong>: Hastily glancing over the
headlines of the papers. The phone rings. Without looking at it, Conroy
answers:</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What? Oh, I’ll be surprised, eh? Listen if
there’s any news in that sheet that I haven’t thrown in the wastepaper
basket, I’ll eat it.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 87</strong>: Stew, as he studies his
typewriter. Over his CLOSEUP comes the excited outraged voice of
Conroy.</p>

here!</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 87</strong>: Stew gets up from his
machine, crumples the sheet of paper into a wad and flings it at the

and automatically reaches for the phone. He picks up the receiver and in
a voice fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew exits.</p>
<p><strong>90. medium shot</strong>: At Conroy’s desk. Conroy’s
expression is one of bitter reproach as he leans back in his swivel
chair as Stew approaches and stands by the desk.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now listen boss, if you’re going to kick about
that expense account�</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Do you call yourself a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>91. medium shot</strong>: Of other reporters, the older man
at the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister or two nearby, who look up
with expectant interest, expecting to hear Stew get a bawling out.</p>
<p><strong>92. close shot - gallagher</strong>: At her desk. She looks
up worried and apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 90</strong>: Stew and Conroy.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It has been alleged - yes�</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: You wouldn’t know news if you fell into a
mess of it, nose first. So you’re the bright lad that’s never been
scooped!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Not on my own beat, no.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: No? Well, where were you when that
happened?</p>
<p><strong>93. close shot - stew</strong>: Not knowing what it is all
about, Stew, with an injured expression, takes the paper and looks at
it.</p>

<p><strong>94. medium shot</strong>: The other reporters, copy readers,
sob sisters, etc., seeing the unusual commotion and Stew’s bewildered
reaction, get out of their chairs and cross over to the City Desk, where
they take up other copies of the same paper to look at. There are amazed
and excited exclamations.</p>
<p><strong>95. closer shot - stew and conroy</strong>: Stew, still
staring dumbly at the paper. A few others are crowding around, glancing
over his shoulder, etc.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: I’ve heard of people being scooped on their
own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it’s news when Anne Schuyler
gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our
own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! Well! What do you guys
want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. Now don’t
tell me you were drunk at the time and don’t remember! Or is this one of
Bingy’s snow-storms?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, no - it’s true, all right, only we didn’t
want to get it in print yet, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, you see, I’ve acquired one of those new
mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn’t understand the whole
idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What do I care about your mother-in-law!
You’re still working for this paper, aren’t you! Or are you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Well, it’s your business to get news! And
here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop
us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever
happens again - just don’t bother about coming back. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Thanks for your congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>96. medium shot</strong>: Stew turns away from Conroy’s desk,
and a group of his confreres come up, surrounding him in a series of
ad-lib congratulations. pounding him on the back, whooping, and in

pushing them off.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the matter with you mugs? Can’t a guy
get married without all this?</p>
<p><strong>100. med. close shot</strong>: Gallagher is seated alone at a
table, looking very forlorn. Her life is suddenly empty. A drink is in
front of her, untouched. She is fighting hard to keep her emotions under
control.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There
you are. What did you run away for?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I didn’t run away.</p>
<p><strong>101. closer shot of the two</strong>: He looks across at her,
grinning boyishly, utterly unaware that what he has done has hurt her
deeply.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, you ran away. Aren’t you going to
congratulate a guy?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Sure. I wish you all the luck in the
world, pal.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Thanks, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I hope you’ll be very happy.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh sure, we’ll be happy. What’s the matter
with your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: It’s the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Joe! A little snifter.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Who me? She wouldn’t want to meet me. I’m
just an old load of hay.</p>
<p><strong>102. close shot - stew</strong>: As his drink is served.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Ah! Thank you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Not since you broke into society.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Remember the time we had a spaghetti party,
and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and
while those mugs weren’t looking, I picked it up and served it to them
anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.</p>
<p><strong>104. close shot - gallagher</strong>: Looking across at
him.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Do you think your wife would walk up
three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Remember, she’s a Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That’s the
name.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: My error.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, if she doesn’t want to come, I’ll come
down alone.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh no, you won’t, Mr. Smith. You’re a
married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with
married men.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Say, what kind of a pal are you? You’re not
going to leave me flat?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh, I’ll call you up some time. And if
your social duties permit - why -</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Cut that out. Just because I’m married -
there’s no reason for that.</p>
<p><strong>106. med. shot</strong>: Conroy, the City Editor, entering
the speakeasy.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 105</strong>: Stew and Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Hey, ixnay - here’s the ossbay.</p>
<p><strong>107. med. shot</strong>: Stew buries his head in the
newspaper, in pretense of looking for something. Conroy appears at the
table and stops. He indicates Stew.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What’s the Benedict looking for in the
newspaper - his lost freedom?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, if it isn’t old Fagin himself.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher and myself just came over here to do
a little work on a story -</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Baloney! Joe! Bring me a special!</p>
<p><strong>108. closer three shot</strong>: Gallagher tries to be very
bright and smiling.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Isn’t it swell about Stew’s marriage?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Well, when are you quitting?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Quitting? I’m not thinking about quitting.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: I take it you don’t have to work for a
living any more�</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: �Mr. Schuyler .</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always
was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s so.</p>
<p><strong>109. closeup - conroy</strong>: He shows that he is genuinely
interested in Stew and his problems, but can’t help being a little
sarcastic.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Anne Schuyler’s in the Blue Book - you’re
not even in the phone book. Think that one over, sucker.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: That doesn’t make any difference� �if
they love each other.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Blah! It’s like a giraffe marrying a monkey.
Listen - you’ll never be anything but just the reporter that married the
Schuyler’s millions. Stew Smith is dead and buried. From now on, you’ll
be just Anne Schuyler’s husband. A rich</p>
<p><strong>gallagher’s voice</strong>: But that’s perfectly
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute. Now, Gallagher, let me do the
talking. Get this, Conroy - Anne Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all
right - and I married her, all right - but her dough and me? No
connection.</p>
<p><strong>110. med. close three shot</strong>: Gallagher is looking
fixedly at Stew - very much worried about Conroy’s dismal prophecies.
Conroy shakes his head in sorrowful gloom.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Just a boid in a gilded cage -</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Aw, you’ve been reading a lot of cheap
tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little
flat, we’re gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we’re gonna be
known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: And live on your salary, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I
finish writing my play.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: What play?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: My play.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: The one about the Siberian bloodhound?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Siberian bloodhound? No. That’s been all
rewritten. It’s laid in Araby now.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Araby?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Araby, my eye�!</p>
<p><strong>111. wider shot</strong>: Conroy, having finished his drink,
pushes back his chair and rises. He puts an affectionate hand on Stew’s
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: Well, I’m sorry to see a good reporter go
blooey� Let me know when you’re quitting.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m not quitting!</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>conroy</strong>: ‘For he’s only a bird in a gilded cage, a
beautiful sight to see�’ Tweet, tweet - ha, ha�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Laugh - laugh, you hyena!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Don’t pay attention to him, Stew. He
doesn’t know what he’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Pay attention? I’m not paying any attention to
him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He’s a
tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn’t know the fine things in life -
that guy. A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It’s getting so a guy can’t step
out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me.
Say, I’m not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life!
I’ll tell you that. Not me, not me. I’m going to step out and mean
something in this world. You watch me. Say, am I a lucky guy to be near
Anne Schuyler? I’ve been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe
me I know it. Lucky, I’ll say I’m lucky!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Sure - I think so, Stew.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I knew you would, pal. A bird in a gilded
cage, eh?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: How is her family going to feel about
it?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Her family? Oh, they’ll be all right. I’ll
bring them around. Gilded cage?! Besides, I’m not marrying her family.
Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha! That mug. What does he
know?</p>
<p><strong>113. med. full shot</strong>: Another jury scene. This time
it is Anne who’s on the carpet. Grayson, in correct afternoon attire,
his hands behind his back and his head sunk, is pacing back and forth in
a very depressed and gloomy fashion.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know what you need me here for - it
isn’t my funeral.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: You stay right here, Michael. Some
day you’ll be head of this family, but thank heaven I shan’t be here
when it happens. And I hope you never have a daughter who gives you
gastritis as Anne has me!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Now Mother, calm yourself. There’s no use in
getting so excited.</p>
<p><strong>114. medium shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler is vastly
agitated.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Oh, isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Some bicarbonate - quick!</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Double strength!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mother, if you keep this up, you’ll have a
nervous breakdown before you go to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>115. closer shot</strong>: Anne, Grayson and
Mrs. Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: It’s a good thing your father passed
away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can’t imagine what made
you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian
who lets his socks come down!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mother, I promise you that he won’t be a
reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get
him away from a man named Gallagher�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>116. wider shot</strong>: The butler enters with a tray on
which is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and brings it to Mrs. Schuyler.
Walking immediately behind the butler is Stew, airily debonair. The
butler glances somewhat uneasily at Mrs. Schuyler as he presents the
tray. She glares blackly at Stew without a word of greeting, and taking
the foaming glass from the tray, starts to lift it to her lips.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Drink hearty, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Anne!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Well, what’s to be done? He’s here
now.</p>
<p><strong>117. medium close shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler and Stew.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Nobody seems to want to do anything�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: About what? Your marriage to
Anne!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we
don’t want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual
blessings, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>118. medium shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler’s eyes flash. She
draws herself up with haughty dignity.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Young man, I want you to know that I
object violently to this whole affair!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly
ridiculous. It’s done now. Stewart and I are married.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m afraid she’s right, Mrs. Schuyler. I’m
really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes
that you would like me. I’m not the burglar that you think I am. After
all, we’re married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up -
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Stop calling me Mother!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right, Grandma�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: This man’s impossible! I can’t talk
to him. Grayson, let’s go where we can talk - hic! See what you’ve done
to me!?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Got it too, huh?</p>
<p><strong>119. closer medium shot</strong>: Anne, Michael and Stew.
Michael grins at Stew.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Who won that round?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m afraid your mother won that round - that
is, she got in the last blow.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t feel the way they do. You’re really
not as bad as everybody thinks.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’re beginning to appreciate me, eh?
Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t worry too much about Mother - she’s
enjoying this. Come on upstairs, I’ll give you a little -</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: A little�? Sure, I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: He can bend!</p>
<p><strong>120. closer shot</strong>: Anne takes a step backwards and
sits down with him on one of the divans. CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM.
He puts an arm about her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Come here baby!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I haven’t seen you for three hours. You’re
neglecting me already�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the matter? Something I et, no doubt.
Egg marks the spot�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I don’t need any new ties. I’ve got another
tie - I’ve got another one besides this one. And it’s a pip, too.
There’s only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a
little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward
ketchup. Of course that’s only in its weaker moments. When you move down
to my place, I’ll show it to you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your place?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah. Oh, it’s great. Of course it doesn’t
compare with this coliseum of yours here, but ’twill serve m’lady,
’twill serve. The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic -
and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a
tiny touch of Grand Rapids.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t you think it’s silly of us to think of
living there when we have this whole big house�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: When ‘we’ . . .? You mean, you’d like to have
me live here in your house?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Sure. We can have the whole left wing and be
all by ourselves all the time.</p>
<p><strong>122. closeup - stew</strong>: He is slightly dazed.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn’t
that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn’t -
there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn’t enough, Mother
will give us the blue room too, I think.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You
haven’t a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn’t that be
nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she
would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But we don’t need it, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I see, we won’t need that. Plenty of room,
plenty of room.</p>
<p><strong>124. wider shot</strong>: He gets up and paces the floor. He
looks at Anne and sees that she is taking him seriously. He drops down
beside her.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Look Anne, you’re not serious about this, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Of course I am Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now let’s get this settled�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You have the cutest nose I’ve�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do
you think I am? You think I’m going to live here in your house - on your
dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don’t be silly. I’d
get the razzing of my life for that. ‘A bird in a gilded cage’ - that’s
what I’d be. Not me. Oh no, not me!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What do you think my friends would say if they
found me in a little cheap flat?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It isn’t cheap. It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Listen Stew baby, let’s not talk about things
like that now�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll do anything you ask me,
Anne, but I will not live�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, I love that nose. It’s such a sweet
nose.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Nevertheless, whether the nose is sweet or
not, I’m not going to live in your house. You may as well get that
straight.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You do want me to be happy, don’t you? Then
I’m not going to live in your house . . .</p>
<p><strong>126. close shot - stew</strong>: In bed, asleep, all curled
up, his head on his arm. CAMERA TRUCKS BACK showing the magnificent
bedroom, with carved wooden panellings, a raised, canopied bed. The
clothes that Stew has taken off the night before are draped haphazardly
about the room. When the Camera gets to a point that takes in a LONG
SHOT of the room, the door to the hall opens and a correctly attired
valet appears. He closes the door noiselessly, goes over to the windows,
and draws the brocaded drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered object
and with a small flourish removes the cover - revealing a birdcage. He
approaches the bed.</p>
<p><strong>127. closer shot</strong>: As Dawson the valet stops beside
the bed. The valet leans over and speaks distinctly.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Mr. Smith, sir�</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Mr. Smith, sir!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Mr. Smith, sir�</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: How do you like your bath, sir?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I like my bath all right. How do you like your
bath?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I’m your valet, sir. Dawson is the name,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’re my what?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Your valet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Thank you, thank you, thank you! I’ll do that
for you some time. That’s very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your
name was?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Dawson, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Drunk, sir?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if
I hired a valet.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Oh, but you didn’t engage me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Who did engage you then, if I didn’t engage
you? What are you doing with my pants�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Did you take anything out of those pants?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Oh no, sir!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What are you doing fooling around in here?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she
engaged me this morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, huh?
That’s very nice of Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley.</p>
<p><strong>129. wider shot</strong>: Stew walks over and gets a
cigarette out of a box on a small table, waving his hand in a gesture of
dismissal. The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for
Stew to step into.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Say, you are nice. You’re all right. You’d
make a good wife.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: But not for me! Though I like you well enough.
You’re a nice fellow. You’re all right. But I’m sorry I don’t need any
valleys today.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don’t
mind my saying so. A gentleman’s gentleman, as it were. Someone to draw
your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it’s really most
essential, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Are you trying to tell me that I need someone
to help me put on my pants and button them up?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Quite so. Quite.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now I’m sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But
I don’t need anybody to help me button my pants - I’ve been buttoning my
pants for thirty years all right, and I can button ’em with one hand as
a matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Now Mr. Smith, now please�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’ve got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn’t
want anything to happen to your face, would you?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Oh no, sir�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right, outside!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I beg your pardon, sir?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Outside!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I think I understand, sir. You mean you want
me to go?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: There you are. You caught on. You see, you’re
nice and you’re smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on!
Outside! And don’t come back!</p>
<p><strong>131. medium shot</strong>: The valet starts edging toward the
door.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: No, sir. No!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Birdcage.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: That’s a canary, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s a canary! Who brought that in here?
Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes, sir. Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that
thing out of here!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Good morning, darling.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith’s clothes
go to the cleaners this morning, please, will you?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Very good, madame.</p>
<p><strong>132. closer shot - anne and stew</strong>: As they hug.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Say, who is this mug?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’ve got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep ’em
closed. I know you’re going to love them.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you like them?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Got my initials on them too. They’re cute.
They’re nice little things - what do you do with them?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You wear them of course, silly.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven’t worn these
things for Years.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Besides I’d look foolish. I couldn’t look
Gallagher in the face.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Darling, I don’t care whether you can look
Gallagher in the face or not, but you’re gonna be a good boy and wear
garters.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Honey, I love you. I’ll eat spinach for you.
I’ll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I’ll wash behind my ears
for you. But I will never wear garters!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my
dear - you’ll wear garters and you’ll like it too!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, no I won’t my dear - oh, no I won’t my
dear - I’ll wash behind my ears, but no I won’t my dear!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my
dear - you’ll eat spinach but you’ll wear garters too!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, you can’t carry a tune - you can’t carry a
tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won’t
wear garters�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh yes you will wear garters�</p>
<p><strong>134. medium full shot</strong>: General activity, as
before.</p>
<p><strong>135. medium close shot</strong>: Stew, reading the newspaper.
It is opened up before his face.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Headlines - about a three-column
article:</p>
<p><strong>occupy schuyler mansion</strong>: As Stew reads this, he
looks very glum and depressed.</p>
<p><strong>136. medium shot</strong>: A reporter, the one Stew had
socked with a wad of paper in an earlier sequence, shambles past and
stops abruptly, staring at Stew’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Of what he sees. Stew’s feet. The socks are
strangely taut.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: The reporter glances up and sees
that Stew cannot see him, and then carefully lifts Stew’s trouser leg a
few inches.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Stew’s feet and legs. As the reporter’s hand
lifts the trouser leg, the fancy solid-gold garters are on full
display.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: The reporter stares at them
goggle-eyed. He can hardly contain himself at the sight of the garters.
He looks off:</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Psst!</p>
<p><strong>137. wider shot</strong>: One or two other reporters hear him
and look over curiously. The reporter looks very mysterious and
important and makes a motion for silence and caution. They get up and
cross on tip-toe to join him.</p>
<p><strong>138. medium shot</strong>: The men around Stew. They quietly
gather around his feet and the reporter who made the discovery proudly
displays his find. One or two more step by and all stare. Stew still has
the paper up in front of his face.</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: Is it real?</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Of course it’s real!</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Any diamonds on them?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Musta set him back at least six bits.</p>
<p><strong>139. medium close shot</strong>: Stew. He is suddenly
attracted by this unusual conversation and lowers his paper, revealing
the group of six or seven men in a huddle round his feet.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: One just can’t wear those and be
decent.</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Yes you can, if you belong to the Four
Hundred.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: I wonder what number he is.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Go on, get out of there! What’s the matter
with you mugs? Didn’t you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on
before?</p>
<p><strong>140. medium shot</strong>: The two reporters who have done
most of the talking scramble to their feet. The second reporter speaks
in mock perplexity.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What do you suppose he wears them for?</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Can it be possible to hold his socks
up?</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Yeah, exactly. You know, one’s hose
look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like, don’t you think so,
percifield?</p>
<p><strong>4th reporter</strong>: Yes, my dear chap - they look ghastly
- they look ghastly!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Go on! Screw! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hey, Stew!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Your policeman!</p>
<p><strong>141. close shot</strong>: Stew at phone.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello? Oh hello dear. Wait just a minute�</p>
<p><strong>142. closeup - anne</strong>: She is lying on her stomach on
a rubbing table, as used by a masseuse. We see a considerable part of
her back, on which a middle-aged Swedish masseuse is industriously
working. Anne has the telephone in her hand. Throughout her scene, we
hear very telling whacks:</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But it’s nearly six o’clock darling, and you
know how long it takes you to dress. But the Ambassador is coming at
eight, and you’ve got to be ready by the time he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>144. ext. front entrance gate</strong>: Two footmen stand at
either side of a huge iron gate. Cars and limousines are arriving,
dropping off guests in evening wear.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor schuyler home</strong>: 145. Gallagher is just
entering. Smythe holds door open for her.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I’d like to see Miss Wilson, please.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Who shall I say, madam?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Miss Gallagher of the Post.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, miss.</p>
<p><strong>146. int. schuyler reception hall</strong>: MOSS AND FONTANA
are doing a beautiful tango. Guests scattered around the room, watching
interestedly.</p>
<p><strong>147. int. corridor schuyler home</strong>: Gallagher is still
waiting. Smythe enters, leading Miss Wilson, a refined-looking girl of
26 or so, her hand extended.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Miss Gallagher of the Post.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Oh yes - of course. Miss Gallagher?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: I’m Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler’s
social secretary.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I was sent from the Post in place of our
social editor.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned
me. Well, what would you like to have?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Why, a list of the guests. That’s the
usual thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Yes, of course. I’ll get it for
you�</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: That’s a lovely dress.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Thank you. Where is Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler’s
husband?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: He’s probably very tired. You see, he’s
had to meet all these people personally tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I bet.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: You newspaper people have a lot of fun
with him, don’t you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?</p>
<p><strong>148. int. entrance of ballroom</strong>: Moss and Fontana are
just finishing their dance. Gallagher stands in doorway with Miss
Wilson, watching them. Excited voices comment on the dance. Miss Wilson
beckons to Gallagher to follow her.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: There’s the Spanish Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: You know, he looks like one.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Miss Wilson�</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Mrs. Smith would like to see you.</p>
<p><strong>miss wilson</strong>: Will you excuse me? Make yourself at
home for just a moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ballroom</strong>: Several groups of men and women are seated
at tables. Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the
men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends
broad stone steps and advances into garden.</p>
<p><strong>151. int. secluded spot in garden</strong>: Stew, his head
cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher wanders into
scene. She sees Stew and stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, with a
happy smile on her lips, moves closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes
conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up. He sees Gallagher;
his face breaks into a happy grin.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Mr. Smith, I’ve read some of your plays
and I’d like an autograph.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, well! If it isn’t my old friend! Turn
around, gal! Let’s get a look at you.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: There you are�!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get
out of the ghetto?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I’m pinch-hitting for our society editor
tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw,
huh? Well gal, I’m afraid we ain’t got no raw life up here.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Well, I’ll have to look someplace
else.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some
well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better
still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give
you a good stiff pain in the neck.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Say, who’s been tying your ties lately?
It looks rotten.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you
doing to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What did you do to that hair? And where did
you get that dress?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I dyed one and washed the other.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well!
You certainly look good.</p>
<p><strong>153. another part of the garden</strong>: Anne is walking in
direction of Stew and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when she sees them.
Her body stiffens.</p>
<p><strong>another shot - stew and gallagher</strong>: From Anne’s
angle. Gallagher is facing in the direction of Anne.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Don’t turn around now - but there’s a
very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Staring at us?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: My mistake - she’s glaring.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Must be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don’t go away. Stay
right there, because I’m going to bring a friend up I want you to
meet.</p>
<p><strong>154. med. close shot - anne</strong>: Standing as before. She
is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and Gallagher come up
to her.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your
life. This is Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Gallagher!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure - my pal on the paper. She’s subbing for
the society editor tonight.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that
Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to
mention that Gallagher was a girl.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Didn’t I? That’s funny. Isn’t it funny?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes - isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>156. close shot - stew and anne</strong>: Stew is beginning
to realize that all is not well as it could be.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You see, we never look at Gallagher as a
girl�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No? What do you look upon her as?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Why, down at the office, we always look at
Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: They all consider me just as one of the
boys.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Indeed? How interesting.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes - isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and
any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Thank you. I’ll go and look for her at
once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Goodbye, Stew�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne.
After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous
to her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I thought I was very charming, Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You did? That’s a lot of hooey! I’ll go and
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Stewart, please!</p>
<p><strong>159. close shot</strong>: Gallagher has just reached the
ballroom when Stew catches up to her.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh, that’s all right, Stew. Forget it. As
far as she’s concerned, I’m just part of the hired help.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, no. Strange, I’ve never seen Anne act that
way before. It’s funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>160. med. close shot</strong>: The butler is just opening the
door. Bingy, looking more disreputable than usual, steps inside.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Hello, there, Meadows!</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Who is it you wish to see, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I
mean Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are
having a reception here this evening�</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and
merry pranks. That’s me. I’m a guy who loves parties. You know�</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: �a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen
now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters, and
tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don’t my whole family’s
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I’ll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a
seat.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to
put it.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Pardon me, sir, but I’ve heard that one
before.</p>
<p><strong>161. close shot</strong>: Stew and Gallagher standing
together. The butler is seen leaving the scene, having just informed
Stew of Bingy’s presence at the reception.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Excuse me. I just want to make sure and see he
doesn’t take away any of the vases.</p>
<p><strong>162. med. shot</strong>: Bingy gets up from his throne chair,
and crosses into the doorway of the library opposite him. He stops by a
carved low-boy, and curiously examines a large antique vase. Stew comes
in and stops with a smile as he sees him.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy to
get in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: No. I was just looking at it. Pretty, ain’t
it? I was just looking for the price tag.</p>
<p><strong>163. closer shot of the two</strong>: Bingy looks him up and
down in silent, insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to
see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Would you like to have me turn around for you,
Bingy?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Oh boy, I’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought
to be able to fool about almost anybody.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or
would you like a photograph?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: A photograph? What’s the matter? Hasn’t mama
had you done in oils yet? “Just A Gigolo . . .”</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now get this mug. You’ve got the kind of chin
I just love to touch. And if you don’t get out of here, I’m going to
hang one right on it.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Take it easy! Take it easy, Dempsey. Just
relax, my boy, relax and open your pores.</p>
<p><strong>164. closer two shot</strong>: Stew glares at him. Bingy goes
on.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: I bring a message from Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a
job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah - go on.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: It’s all right. You can write your own
ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’ll bite. What’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: There’s no catch. This is on the up and up.
Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne
Schuyler’s Husband.</p>
<p><strong>165. med. shot</strong>: Taking in the doorway. The butler
starts to pass by. Stew’s eyes are blazing.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Well, how does the old Cinderella man feel
about that?</p>
<p><strong>166. closer shot in doorway</strong>: Bingy describes a
backward arc, just as Smythe, the butler, seeing he can be of service,
steps forward and catches him.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Well done, sir. Very neat.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s what I think of it, Bingy!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>167. medium close shot</strong>: Anne and her mother at the
breakfast table.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Good morning, Mother. Didn’t I tell you that
he’d be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: I was so worried for fear he’d knock
over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot. What does it
say about the reception last night?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended
the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Stop it. Anne. You’re behaving like
the person you’re married to.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You don’t have anything to complain about,
Mother. He was all right last night, wasn’t he? I told you not to worry
about him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: It was a miracle. The man was ill or
something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Ah-ah-ah!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Look! Look! The front page!</p>
<p><strong>168. medium shot</strong>: Mrs. Schuyler gets up. Paces
wildly about room. In a frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: I knew it! I knew it! I felt it in my
bones!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Did you see the papers? “Cinderella Man
Grows Hair On Chest!” This is the most terrible kind of publicity that
could possibly�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Don’t you think I know it,
Grayson?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Double-strength!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: “Cinderella Man Grows Hair On
Chest!”</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: “I wear the pants,” says Anne Schuyler’s
husband!</p>
<p><strong>169. medium shot</strong>: Stew, now dressed in a business
suit, comes from the direction of the stairs and stops just before he
gets to the door of the drawing room. From within there is an ominous
silence. Stew looks longingly in the direction of the front door - then
back at the drawing room, squares his shoulders and goes in.</p>
<p><strong>170. close shot</strong>: As Stew stops just inside the
doorway. He had been prepared for this, but it strikes terror into his
soul, just the same.</p>
<p><strong>171. medium full shot</strong>: From his angle in the
doorway. The jury - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back - is standing,
gazing at Stew with a fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. Anne is
crying softly.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 170</strong>: Stew - looking around at the
gallery of faces. Then he forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts
to enter, whistling as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Good morning, everybody�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Have you seen this?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes - the worm!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: He’s a worm - and I’m gonna step on him!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common
brawl, in my own home! “I wear the pants!” The pants ! Not even the
trousers!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I’ve tried to stop the evening papers, but
it’s useless.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You quit trying to stop anybody�</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Well, at best you might deny it.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they
print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our
traps shut.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Traps shut!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Certainly! I’ll take care of this guy Bingy
myself, personally. Now what are you crying about?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say
it?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn’t say
it for publication, however.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: And you struck him right here in our
house�?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes, I’m sorry, I struck him right here in
your house. And I’ll strike anybody in anybody’s house that calls me a
Cinderella Man.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Well, what else do you expect them to call
you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Dexter.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s the fourteenth crack you’ve made to me.
I’m keeping count. When you get to twenty, I’m gonna sock you right on
the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit
there and watch this man insult us? Haven’t you any decency left?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why doesn’t Dexter show some decency? And you
might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he’s
called such names? I’m glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved
it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: All right, all right! It’s your
funeral, Anne Schuyler!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Go on, beat it, shadow.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Cinderella Man! That’s fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>177. full shot</strong>: Six or eight people of distinction
scattered around the room. All dressed in full evening clothes. Among
them is Grayson, Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator’s uniform. The
men have their coats and hats in their hands, the women have their
evening wraps on. Apparently they are ready to leave for someplace and
are being detained. An indistinct murmur of ad-lib conversation is
heard.</p>
<p><strong>178. close shot</strong>: On Smythe, the butler, as he
approaches Mrs. Schuyler.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from
the Mayor’s committee to remind you it’s past the hour for the
reception.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Are the cars ready?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: They’ve been ready for the last half
hour.</p>
<p><strong>179. med. close shot - group</strong>: Including Captain
White, a young, handsome aviator.</p>
<p><strong>aviator</strong>: I hope I don’t have to make any speeches
tonight, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, you can’t disappoint all the women. After
all it isn’t every day they get to see a famous round-the-world
flier.</p>
<p><strong>aviator</strong>: Yes, I know, but they scare me to death.
This is the fourth dinner you’ve taken me to this week. I’m running out
of material.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you complaining?</p>
<p><strong>aviator</strong>: Yes, there are always too many other people
around.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Anne, it’s getting late. What are we waiting
for?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: We’re waiting for my husband�</p>
<p><strong>180. medium shot</strong>: Stew stands in front of a mirror,
fumbling with his dress tie. He pauses, his hands still on his tie.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Stewart! We’re all waiting for you. Where’s
your valet?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I poisoned him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m not going!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m talking about - I’m not going out.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What am I going downstairs and tell those
people?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell
them I’m not going. Tell them I’m not home.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Stewart, would you mind telling me why you’re
not going?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes, I’ll tell you - for the same reason I’ve
never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling
fashion plates. I don’t like them. They bore me. They give me the
jitters.</p>
<p><strong>anne’s voice</strong>: Do you know you’re talking about my
friends?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes, I’m talking about your friends, and they
still give me the jitters.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, are you going - or aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Anne, come here. Listen�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’ll tell you what. Let’s you and me sneak out
all by ourselves�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Think of the fun we can have - we’ll sneak
down the back stairs and get in the valet’s Ford. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Will you stop being silly, Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’ll tell you what let’s do - I’ll take you
and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But I don’t want to meet your gang.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I don’t mean the newspaper fellows that you
don’t like. Another gang I know - you’d love them. They’re writers and
musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great
things. People who are worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Meaning, my friends aren’t worthwhile, I
suppose?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, they’re all right, Anne. But I�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s exactly what you mean. Heaven knows
you’ve made that clear to me often enough. Well, I’m sick and tired of
it. I’ve given you party after party - I’ve taken you to some of the
best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance -
and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I’m sick
and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you’ve
done. Perhaps it’s just as well you’re not coming tonight. Maybe I can
enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you’re
going to do.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: And that, my friends, is what is known as the
society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter to go to -
how-have-you-been, Mr. Smith!</p>
<p><strong>184. close shot</strong>: As Stew sits in a typewriter chair.
He rolls up the sheet in the machine so that he can read what is already
written.</p>
<p><strong>an hacienda in mexico</strong>: Strumming of guitars are
dimly heard.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: He studies it for a moment, frowning
in dissatisfaction. He’s stuck. He leans back in the chair and looks up
for inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>185. long shot</strong>: Of Stew Smith pacing the grand
foyer. Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by the surroundings. He tries
hopscotching on the pattern of the floor. That wears thin quickly.
Supremely bored, Stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a cavernous
echo. Smythe the butler then appears, nervously crouched behind some
grillwork.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Did you call, sir?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you. Come
on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I’m going nuts. I’m going nuts in this
house! This big . . . come on, I’m not going to hurt you. Come on,
what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Shhh! Do you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You try it.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, no. Give it more volume.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, that’s enough. I just wanted you to get
the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over .
. .?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Found no skeletons?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It’s haunted just the same.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean,
when you’re not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Well, sir, I putter.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe! I mean - when you’re alone and want to
amuse yourself, then what?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I just putter.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a
putter to putter?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, isn’t that nice? You just go right ahead
and putter with your hands. That’s all right. How do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Well sir, I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: That’s puttering, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No! Well, well, well! That’s all right, if you
like it. Can anybody do that?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Oh no, sir. Some people are natural
putterers. Others can never master it.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh my. You mean, some people are born and
never will become putterers?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh my, wouldn’t that be tragic? To know that
you could never be a putterer.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: How about me? Do you think if I concentrated
and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a
putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, if I couldn’t be a good putterer, I
wouldn’t want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn’t be a
good putterer?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Well sir, to be a putterer, one’s mind must
be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For
instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he’d
be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not
in a cage, because he’d be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will
pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an
eagle in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: A bird in a gilded cage?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s all I wanted to know!</p>
<p><strong>187. medium shot</strong>: As Stew makes a telephone
call.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Gallagher old pal. How are you, old
pal?</p>
<p><strong>188. medium shot</strong>: A simple room, probably in a
boarding house or cheap hotel. Gallagher is on the phone. A typewriter
stands nearby.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh, hello Stew. I’m pretty good, can’t
complain. How’s our gentleman of leisure?</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 187</strong>: Stew at phone.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m on the coast of Norway and I can’t get out
- will you come and get me out of the coast of Norway?</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 188</strong>: Gallagher at phone.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene One:
Coast of Norway - and then a lot of blank. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 187</strong>: Stew at phone.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Yeah. Come on, don’t be silly. All right, if
you feel like you need a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You’ll find him
at Joe’s, no doubt. Yeah. Hank would be my idea of a perfect
bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 188</strong>: Gallagher at phone.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Stew comes out of the library. Smythe is
going down the hall. Stew intercepts him.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe, I’ll get this. I’m expecting some
friends.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>190. med. close shot</strong>: At entrance door. Stew enters
and opens it. Gallagher and Hank enter.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Hello, Stew.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Hank. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Fine, but kinda thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Come right in - I’ll get you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Okay - you remember Joe�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow.
You don’t mind, do you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It’s all right. Bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Come in, Joe. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just a minute - Johnson’s outside. You don’t
mind if he comes in and dips a beak do you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, no, bring him in. The more the
merrier.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Come on in!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hello, Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Glad to see you. Come in, kid.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Wait a minute. I got two of the boys I
brought along - they were cruising around with nothing to do. You don’t
mind if I bring them in?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You brought two of the boys? That’s all right.
Bring them in. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>191. medium full shot</strong>: They swarm into the hallway
and overflow into the rooms on either side. The butler stands aghast at
this invasion. Stew starts to close the door when three or four more
troop in, shouting cheery greetings. Stew regards them in amazement.</p>
<p><strong>192. closer shot - stew</strong>: As he watches them file
past.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I’m sorry nobody could come.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: The rest of the gang had to get out the
morning edition - but they’ll be down later.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now Hank, are you sure they’re coming? It will
be lonesome without them.</p>
<p><strong>193. full shot</strong>: The gang have taken seriously Stew’s
suggestion that they make themselves at home. They have draped
themselves about the place - a couple are strumming on the piano and
others are inspecting the room in awe-struck attitudes. Smythe is being
propelled around the room by the revellers.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: It isn’t done, gentlemen! It isn’t done, I
say! It isn’t done!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no
chances, did you?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I’m sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank
did the rest.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I see. Hank brought them all. That’s all
right. We’ll give them a drink and throw ’em out. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Smythe! Give them one drink and throw ’em
out!</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Is there a green elephant standing beside that
bwana?</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: No, it’s just little Bingy Baker.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Big Chief Bingy come to white man’s tepee to
make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over
and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn’t miss this one
for the world.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Fire water all right. Both start
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Well, Stew, that’s all thrashed out. By
golly, I’m surely glad to see that you’re not really sore. You know our
racket - after all, news is news.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure, sure. That’s all right. That was a great
story, Bingy. A great story - wish I’d printed it.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: I gave you the breaks, didn’t I? That hairy
chest story!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’ve raised it up to the chin, I see.</p>
<p><strong>195. closer shot</strong>: Gallagher and Stew.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You know what I should do with you? I should
sock you right in that funny little nose.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yes - and I’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Sure, you’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>196. medium shot</strong>: Stew and Gallagher enter.
Apparently they have been talking about Stew’s play on the way
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: How far have you gotten?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Well, I’ve just been able to get off that
Norway coast - so far.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: ‘Act One - Scene One - A Street in Old
Madrid�’</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Well, you’re not getting your play done,
but you’re certainly covering a lot of territory.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Haven’t I covered some territory? It feels
like I’ve been on a Cook’s Tour some place.</p>
<p><strong>197. closer two shot</strong>: Stew, standing before her.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Stewart, have you ever been to Old
Madrid?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Been where?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Never even been to New Madrid.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Then how do you expect to write about
it?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Did Conrad draw on his imagination?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Did who?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What do you know about Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I don’t know a thing about him, but isn’t
he the one you’re always yelling about?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gosh, you look cute.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Isn’t he the one that always writes about
things - only the things he knows about?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Didn’t he go to sea before he wrote about
it?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Then why don’t you write about something
you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich
girl - now there’s a swell theme.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gee, that’s an idea, Gallagher. That’s an idea
there. I wonder now . . .</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Oh, sure. She’d make a beautiful heroine
. . .</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: And there’s her mother - and what a character
that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer
friend of theirs - he’d make a great villain - and there’s you!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: What could I be?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You could be something. I’ve got an idea,
Gallagher. Let’s get this set. That’s a great idea for a play. Pal, get
me a cigarette, will you?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right, thanks. Now, let’s see. How will I
start? Hey pal, how would you start?</p>
<p><strong>199. med. full shot</strong>: Shooting through into the
drawing room. It is many hours later. The members of the party,
including Smythe, are pretty well lit. On the floor of the entrance hall
a dice game is in progress. In the drawing room four or five are hanging
over the piano singing “The Grasshopper Jumped Over Another
Grasshopper’s Back.”</p>
<p><strong>hall</strong>: The outer door starts to swing open. One of
the party guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in
his hand, staggers toward the door. It opens wider, and Anne and
Mrs. Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in the opening. The guest
comes up to them.</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Say, you can’t come in here - this is a
private party.</p>
<p><strong>201. medium shot</strong>: On a drunk Bingy as he peers at
them from an alcove above.</p>
<p><strong>bingy</strong>: Hey, my old classmate from Harvard! Whoopee!
Harvard, ’98! Hello, mama!</p>
<p><strong>202. medium shot</strong>: Most are too cock-eyed or too
engrossed in the ongoing crap game to notice them.</p>
<p><strong>dexter</strong>: I know who’s the cause of it all!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Dexter!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Smythe! Smythe - who are these
people?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Friends of mine. Very lit-lit-literary
people.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Smythe, you’ve been drinking.</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: I have. Double-strength!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Very drunk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Where is Mr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>smythe</strong>: Well, for crying out loud, I don’t know. And
I don’t care. Whoopee!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Very, very drunk.</p>
<p><strong>203. medium shot</strong>: Stew gets to his feet as an idea
strikes him.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great
scene - a tremendously emotional scene - some-</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Nope - afraid I’m all out of tricks
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now, we’ve got it right up to where the boy’s
wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>204. med. close shot</strong>: At the partially opened door
into the hall. It opens wider, and Anne looks in. She stares in
horrified amazement.</p>
<p><strong>205. medium shot</strong>: Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled
out on the chaise longue, stretches luxuriously and yawns. CAMERA PANS
TO Stew at the typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot and cups prominent,
the dressing gown over the back of his chair. Neither of them has seen
Anne.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 204</strong>: Anne. She gasps as she
quietly steps further into the room.</p>
<p><strong>206. close shot - gallagher</strong>: Gallagher, caught in
the midst of a grand stretch, sits up abruptly, startled. She stares
uncomfortably off at Anne.</p>
<p><strong>207. close shot - stew</strong>: At the typewriter. He
glances up momentarily and very absently, and goes right on typing.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh hello, Anne�</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Good morning. What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What does what mean?</p>
<p><strong>208. medium shot - the three</strong>: Gallagher, sensing
scene, starts hastily looking for her shoes. One of them has been shoved
under the chaise longue and she has to get down on her hands and knees
to retrieve it. Anne comes in and confronts them, her hands on her
hips.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so
interested in the play I forgot all about them.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a
play! Of course most of it is Gallagher’s. She did most of it. That
brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m not interested in the way her brain
snaps.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I think I better go, Stew.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I think you should, Miss Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute, Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the idea, Anne?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The idea is simply this - that I want those
people to leave here immediately.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now wait a minute. Aren’t you being a little
unreasonable?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place
looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place
turned into a cheap barroom?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Now wait, don’t get excited, Anne. There’s no
reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink.
That’s all right. I’m sorry. I’ll go right down and throw them out.
That’s no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly
have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your house?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: I suppose I’ve been boarding out this past
year.</p>
<p><strong>210. medium shot</strong>: He takes his coat off back of
chair and slips into it.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right, I’ll tell you this�I don’t like
your boarding house, lady�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: �and if it’s all the same to you, I’m moving
out.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Stewart!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: This is something I should have done a long
time ago, only I didn’t have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick
around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well
was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that’s
that.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You can’t walk out of here like this.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Oh I can’t? Who’s going to stop me? I’d like
to see somebody stop me. If you think I’m going to stick around this
joint just to look at this mausoleum, not on your life! You’re going to
make no stuffed shirt out of me. Now what do you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: What’s going on here? Who is this
woman?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Joan of Arc! What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schuyler</strong>: Heavens! The man’s insane!</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Sure I’m insane, but I’ve got some good news
for you. This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint.
This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that
is what is known as telling the mother-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Eurek�!</p>
<p><strong>212. medium shot</strong>: Stew is stuffing things into a
bag.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You’ve done nothing but watch me - watch me! -
ever since I’ve been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a
hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane� �goes out
and counts the silverware.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Fine! I don’t blame her. I know I’m out of my
own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I’ll
stay in my own backyard from now on.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re acting like a child.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: All right, I’m a child. Have it any way you
want. But I’m going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived
in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All
right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside
will say “Mr. Stew Smith” and you’ll have to be “Mrs. Stew Smith” or
there’s nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler’s husband�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: �and here’s some more news for you. You can
take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing,
and you know what you can do with them!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Stewart!</p>
<p><strong>213. medium shot</strong>: Stew and Gallagher appear, coming
through the iron gates.</p>
<p><strong>214. medium moving shot</strong>: As Stew and Gallagher move
off down the street, a ragged old panhandler comes wheedling up to
them.</p>
<p><strong>panhandler</strong>: Pardon me, could you spare a dime for a
cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Coffee? How would you like to be a Knight of
the Garter?</p>
<p><strong>panhandler</strong>: Huh! No�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Just a minute. Entertain the gentleman,
Gallagher.</p>
<p><strong>panhandler</strong>: How about the socks?</p>
<p><strong>215. med. close shot</strong>: As Stew and Gallagher pass the
Camera and go down the street, arm in arm. As they get past the Camera,
Stew is seen to square his shoulders and throw out his chest. He shakes
first one leg, and then the other, as if he were throwing off
shackles.</p>
<p><strong>216. closer moving shot</strong>: Stew and Gallagher moving
along. Gallagher has a peculiar expression as she glances at Stew. She
has been deeply affected by the scene she has just witnessed. Stew’s
face is very thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: I wouldn’t worry too much about it, Stew.
She’ll see it your way.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Huh? Oh, I’m not worrying about her - I’m
worrying about that second act curtain, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Why, you’re just a first-class chump! You
just staged a scene that would play like a million dollars! How about
that declaration of independence for the second act curtain?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: That’s an idea, Gallagher - a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>insert: sheet in typewriter</strong>: On it is being
typed:</p>
<p><strong>full shot</strong>: Inexpensive but comfortable. Stew is in
his shirtsleeves. A battered old typewriter stands on the table with a
sheet of blank paper in it. Stew is seated in a chair before it, and is
picking out the letters, typing. He pauses, running up the roller to
regard what he has written.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying some
ham and eggs. She looks up as she sees Stew from the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Hey, Gallagher!</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: How about my breakfast? How do you expect me
to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: It’ll be ready in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Never mind that. If you can’t get my breakfast
ready - and can’t get here on time in the morning - then you can go get
yourself another job.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Sorry, boss�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Don’t be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: There is a knock on the hall door.</p>
<p><strong>220. closer shot</strong>: As Stew opens the door. It reveals
Dexter Grayson in the little hallway, immaculately clad, as usual. Stew
regards him in frank surprise for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Hello, Smith.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Holy jumping swordfish!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I suppose you know why I came�?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: No, I have no idea - unless some of the
silver-ware is missing.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Now don’t be absurd, Smith�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Surely, come right in.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Thanks. May I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Surely, sit down. If I had known you were
coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I don’t eat waffles.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>221. med. shot</strong>: Grayson sits stiffly on one of the
Grand Rapids chairs. Stew remains standing, and waits silently for
Grayson to speak. Grayson clears his throat.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Anne asked me to come and see you about the
divorce.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: She did�?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: She wants me to arrange the financial
settlement.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Listen Grayson, I’ve got 106 bucks and 75
cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but
she’d better hurry because I’m spending it awfully fast.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: You don’t seem to understand. Anne doesn’t
expect anything from you.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Gallagher. Overcome by curiosity at the sound
of voices, she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway
and peeks out.</p>
<p><strong>223. med. shot</strong>: Grayson and Stew.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: We should like to know how much you would
want to�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she
wants to pay me alimony?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: That’s putting it crudely, but�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Remember what I told you about that twentieth
crack? All right, you’ve just made it. Before you go unconscious I want
you to get this through your nut.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Unconscious. You know, when you don’t know
anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can’t buy
their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of
those guys.</p>
<p><strong>224. close shot</strong>: Showing kitchen door open a crack.
Gallagher’s eyes are glistening as she watches and listens.</p>
<p><strong>225. med. close shot</strong>: Stew and Grayson.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: We just thought that�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Don’t think. Let me do all the thinking. Now
you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn’t marry
that dame for her dough and I don’t want any of her dough now. I was too
poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I’m giving her
a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: And now for that twentieth crack�</p>
<p><strong>226. wider shot</strong>: Stew thrusts his hands into his
pockets and walks thoughtfully back to the typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>227. closer shot</strong>: Stew standing staring down at the
typewriter. He is still flushed with anger. Suddenly a thought strikes
him, and his face breaks into a broad grin. He sits down quickly, and
begins pounding away.</p>
<p><strong>228. med. shot</strong>: Gallagher enters from the kitchen,
carrying a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee pot. She sets them on a
small table and this is spread with a cloth. Then she crosses over to
Stew.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us
a great opening for the third act.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: What was the idea he gave you?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: It’s a swell idea, Gallagher. How’s this? The
wife’s family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the
divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him
alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws
him out. How’s that for the beginning of the third act, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: Well, from now on the play will be easy.
All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she’s sorry, and
then your play’s over.</p>
<p><strong>230. closeup - stew</strong>: He looks over at Gallagher with
a peculiar expression.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the matter? Do you think I’m going to
let that guy go back to his wife? Not on your life. He’s got to go to
the other girl.</p>
<p><strong>231. closeup - gallagher</strong>: She almost drops her
coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as she looks back at him. Gallagher
tries hard to keep her voice steady.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: What other girl�?</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: The little O’Brien girl, of course - the one
you suggested in the story.</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: But that’s ridiculous! You can’t make a
sudden change like that.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me
how to write a play?</p>
<p><strong>gallagher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: There’s nothing sudden about that�</p>
<p><strong>233. close two shot</strong>: Gallagher watches him a bit
uncertainly.</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: He goes to the little O’Brien gal and he says
to her - in some pretty words of some kind - something that you can
write - he’ll say�</p>
<p><strong>stew</strong>: What’s the matter, Gallagher? What’s the
matter?</p>
