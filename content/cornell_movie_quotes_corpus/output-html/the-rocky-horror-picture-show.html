that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in
on Dr Scott’s refresher lectures.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only
reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite
subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.</p>

<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dammit, Janet.</p>
<p><strong>brad, janet, family.</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I would like if I may to take you on a
strange journey.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss left Denton that late November
evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of
them. It’s true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and
pendulous, toward which they were driving. It’s true also that the spare
tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. But they being
normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was a night out they were going to
remember for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Gosh. That’s the third motorcyclist that’s
passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the
weather and all.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yes, Janet. Life’s pretty cheap to that
type.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What’s the matter Brad, darling?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I think we took the wrong fork a few miles
back.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists
come from?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hmmm … Well, I guess we will have to turn
back.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What was that bang?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: We must have a blow-out.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You’d better sit here and keep warm while I go
for help.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: But where will you go? We’re in the middle of
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Didn’t we pass a castle back down the road a
few miles? Maybe they have a telephone I might use.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: There’s no point both of us getting wet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m coming with you. Besides, darling, the
owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come
back.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night
Burning bright.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: There’s a guiding star No matter what or who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: There’s a light</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: Over at the Frankenstein place.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: There’s a light.</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: Burning in the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: There’s a light, a light In the darkness of
everybody’s life</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I can see the flag fly I can see the rain Just
the same There has got to be Something better here For you and me.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: There’s a light.</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: Burning in the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: There’s a light.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: A light In the darkness of everybody’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: The darkness must go Down the river of
nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Into my life.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: There’s a light.</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: Over at the Frankenstein place.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: There’s a light.</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: Burning in the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>phantom voices</strong>: There’s a light, a light.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: In the darkness of everybody’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And so it seemed that fortune had smiled
on Brad and Janet and that they had found the assistance that their
plight required - or had they?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, Brad. Let’s go back. I’m cold and I’m
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just a moment, Janet. They may have a
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this
is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our
car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we
might use?</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: You’re wet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Yes, the rain has been very heavy.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: I think you had better both come
inside.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You’re too kind.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad, I’m frightened. What kind of place
is this?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh, it’s probably some kind of hunting lodge
for rich weirdos.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Are you - giving a party?</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: No. You’ve arrived on a rather special
night. It’s one of the master’s affairs.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, lucky him.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: He’s lucky.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: You’re lucky, I’m lucky, we’re all
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: It’s astounding Time is fleeting Madness
takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer I’ve got to
keep control.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: I remember doing the Time Warp.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Drinking those moments when The blackness
would hit me.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: And the void would be calling.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It’s just a jump to the left.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: And a step to the right - right - right -
right - right.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With your hands on your hips.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: You bring your knees in tight. But it’s the
pelvic thrust.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: It’s so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you
can’t see me No not at all.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Well I was walking down the street Just
having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink. Well it shook
me up It took me by surprise He had a pick-up truck And the devil’s eyes
He stared at me And I felt a change Time meant nothing Never would
again.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Let’s do the Time Warp again.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It’s just a jump to the left.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: And then a step to the right.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With your hands on your hips.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: You bring your knees in tight.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh….Say something.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Brad, please lets get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: For God’s sake keep a grip on yourself
Janet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: But it seems so unhealthy here.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s just a..a party Janet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well I want to leave.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: We can’t go anywhere until I get to a
phone.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Then ask the butler - or someone.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Let’s wait awhile Janet. We don’t want to
interfere with their celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: This isn’t the Junior Chamber of Commerce
Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: They’re probably foreigners with ways
different from our own. - They may do some more folk dancing.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Brad - I’m cold, I’m wet, and plain
scared.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m here, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>go to colour at beginning of following scene</strong>:
——————————————–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t get strung out by the way that I
look.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t judge a book by its cover I’m not much
of a man By the light of day But by night I’m one hell of a lover.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual
Transylvania.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m glad we caught you at home Ah - could we
use your phone We’re both in a bit of a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: We’ll just say where we are Then go back to
the car We don’t want to be any worry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You got caught with a flat Well how about
that Well babies don’t you panic By the light of the night It’ll seem
alright I’ll get you a satanic mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m just a sweet transvestite From Transexual
Transylvania.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why dont’cha stay for the night</p>
<p><strong>riff &amp; magenta</strong>: “night” Or maybe a bite</p>
<p><strong>riff &amp; magenta</strong>: “bite” I could show you my
favourite obsession I’ve been making a man With blonde hair and a tan
And he’s good for relieving my tension.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m just a sweet transvestite From Transexual
Transylvania.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: “Sweet Transvestite”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: From Transexual Transylvania.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: “Transylvania”</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So come up to the Lab.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Slowly, slowly. It’s too nice a job to
rush.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s alright Janet, we’ll play along for now
and pull out the aces when the time is right.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Ah, hi. My name is Brad Majors and this is my
fiancee, Janet Weiss. You are …</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: You are very lucky to be invited up to
Frank’s laboratory. Some people would give their right arm for the
privilege.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: People like you maybe</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: It he - Frank - is he your husband?</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: The Master is not yet married. Nor do I
think he ever will be. We are simply his servants.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff
Raff.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I will entertain…ah…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet
Vice.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How forceful you are Brad. Such a perfect
specimen of manhood. So dominant.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well, yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you have any tattoos Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Certainly not!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh well. How about you.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Everything is in readiness, Master. We
merely await your word.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tonight…One, one, one. Can you hear me at the
back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in
biochemical research.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And paradise is to be mine.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It was strange the way it happened. One of
those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem
irredeemably lost: you panic; you’re trapped; your back’s against the
wall. There’s no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. All the
pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you’r been. What a fool.
The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it
happen. An accident!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s how I discovered the secret. That
elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Throw open the switches on the sonic
oscillator.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And step up the reactor power input three
more points.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Brad…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s alright Janet.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: The Sword of Damocles is Hanging over my
head.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: And I’ve got the feeling Someone’s going to
be Cutting the thread.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: I woke up this morning With a start When I
fell out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of
un-nameable dread.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: That ain’t no crime</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: My high is low. I’m dressed up With no place
to go.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Oh, no no, no no.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Sha la la la That ain’t no crime.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: No no no, no no.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Sha la la la That ain’t no crime - That
ain’t no crime.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn’t know
He was doing just fine.</p>

day out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: O.K? I think we can do a little better than
that.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well. I don’t like men with…er, with too
many, muscles.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I didn’t make him for you</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: CHARLES ATLAS</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A weakling weighing Ninety eight pounds Will
get sand in his face When kicked to the ground. And soon in the gym With
a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his
ca-ha-hause</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Will make him glisten - thank you - And
gleam. And with massage And just a little bit of Ste-he-he-he-hem… He’ll
be pink. And quite clean.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’ll be a strong man - Oh honey -</p>
<p><strong>guests, riff, magenta &amp; columbia &amp; frank.</strong>:
But the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’ll eat nutritious high protein And swallow
raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>guests, riff, magenta &amp; columbia &amp; frank</strong>: I
can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’ll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the
snatch, clean and jerk.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Eddie!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Stay cool baby.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Who’s Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: The delivery boy.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: His delivery wasn’t good enough though.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Whatever happened to Saturday night When you
dressed up sharp And you felt alright It don’t seem the same since
cosmic light Came into my life and I thought I was divine.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that
rock and roll</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: My head used to swim From the perfume I
smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I’d
taster her baby pink lipstick, And that’s when I’d melt. And she’d
whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that
rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>all eddie</strong>: Hot patootie HOT PATOOTIE - Bless my
soul. BLESS MY SO-O-OUL. I really love that rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One from the vaults.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But a deltoid And a bicep, A hot groin And a
tricep Makes me - ooh - Shake. Makes me want To take Charles Atlas By
the ha-and.</p>
<p><strong>guests, riff raff, magenta &amp; columbia &amp;
frank</strong>: I can make you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There are some people who say that life is
an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations!
If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden
departure of their host and his creation had left them feeling both
apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests
‘departed’ and ‘they’ were shown to their separate rooms.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Who is it? Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>brad’s voice</strong>: It’s only me, Janet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, Brad, come in, darling.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what
if…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s alright Janet. Everything’s going to be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch
on the light.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: No, don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh don’t be so shy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m afraid so, Janet. But isn’t it nice?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You beast, you monster, what have you done
with Brad?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nothing. Why, do you think I should?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You tricked me - I wouldn’t have - I’ve never
- never</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know. But it wasn’t all bad was it? In
fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so
sensual.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help. I - Brad -
Oh. Brad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ssssh. Brad’s probably asleep by now. Do you
want him to see you like this?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Like this - like how? It’s your fault. You’re
to blame. I was saving myself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I’m sure you’re not spent yet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Promise you won’t tell Brad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cross my heart and hope to die.</p>
<p><strong>janet’s voice</strong>: Oh Brad, it’s no good here. It will
destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t worry Janet, we’ll be away from here in
the morning. Hmmmm, you smell so good.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad. Oh no. Not till after the wedding,
Darling.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Alright, Janet. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Maybe we could try it this way.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Janet! Oh! Yes it’s alright. Janet.
Everything’s going to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I hope so my darling.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m afraid so, Brad. But wasn’t it nice?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why you - what have you done with Janet?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nothing. Why do you think I should?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You tricked me. I wouldn’t have - I’ve never -
never.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know, but it wasn’t all bad was it? I think
you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet. Janet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shush. Janet’s probably asleep by now. Do you
want her to see you like this?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Like this. Like how? It’s your fault - you’re
to blame. I thought it was the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh come on, Brad, admit it. It was enjoyable,
wasn’t it? There’s no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You promise you won’t tell?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: On my mother’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Master, Rocky has broken his chains and
vanished. The new playmate is loose and in the castle ground. Magenta
has just released the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What’s happening here? Where’s Brad? Where’s
anybody?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Once in a while she don’t want to call you
Speaking on the telephone Once in your life she won’t want to know you
You look around The one you’ve found She is gone.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m engaged to Brad just the same as Betty
Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank’s kisses overwhelmed me with an
ecstacy I’ve never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: And that’s all the time that it takes For a
heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break
You hear something about someone You’d thought you’d known.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I could see Brad’s face before me and my mind
screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: So baby don’t cry like there’s no tomorrow
After the night there’s a brand new day. And there’ll be no pain And no
more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It’ll be O.K.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I wanted to be loved completely. My body
throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this
to you?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: And that’s all the time that it takes For a
heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look
around The one you’ve found Is back again.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: If only we hadn’t made this journey. If only
the car hadn’t broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane
persons.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: “If” and “Only”, two small words. Words
which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet’s thoughts. But
it was too late to go back now. It was as if she were riding a giant
tidal wave. It would be folly to fight against it. Her only chance would
be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Yes. There you see it’s instinctive. This
room is your womb. You returned here for one thing - security.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad! What have they done with him?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh Brad. How could you? Oh, but you’re hurt.
Did they do this to you?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Here, lie down. I’ll dress your wounds.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: “Emotion”. Mental agitation - an excited
state of. It is also an irrational and powerful master and from what
Janet had witnessed on the monitor, there seemed to be little doubt that
she was indeed its slave.</p>
<p><strong>columbia &amp; magenta</strong>: Tell us about it, Janet.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I was feeling done in Couldn’t win I’d only
ever kissed before</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: You mean she only ever kissed?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I thought there’s no use getting Into heavy
petting.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Now all I want to know Is how to go I’ve
tasted blood And I want more I’ll put up no resistance I want to stay
the distance I’ve got an itch to scratch And I need assistance.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be
dirty. Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff, magenta, columbia</strong>: Down, down down.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: And that’s just one small fraction Of the
main attraction You need a friendly hand. Oh, and I need action.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: I wanna be dirty.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna
be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me - oh - Creature of the
night.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Creature of the night.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Creature of the night. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Aaaargh! Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How did it happen? I understood you were to
be watching.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: I was only away for a minute Master.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, see if you can find him on the
monitor.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Master, we have a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: You know this earth - this person.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I most certainly do. He happens to be an old
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I see. So this wasn’t simply a chance
meeting. You came here with a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I told you, my car broke down.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I was telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr
Everett Scott. His name is not unknown to me.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And now he works for your Government, doesn’t
he, Brad? He’s attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you
call U.F.O’s. Isn’t he, Brad?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: He might be. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hmmmm. He’ll be in the Zen Room.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, let’s ask him.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dr. Scott!</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: Brad! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t play games, Dr Scott. You know very
well what Brad Majors’s doing here. It was part of your plan was it not
that he, and his female, should check the layout for you. Well,
unfortunately for you all there’s to be a change of plans. I’m sure
you’re adaptable, Dr Scott. I know Brad is.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: I can assure you that Brad’s presence
comes as a complete surprise to me. I came to find Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Eddie? I’ve seen him. He’s…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Eddie? What do you know of Eddie, Dr
Scott?</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: I happen to know a great deal about a lot
of things. You see Eddie happens to be my nephew.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dr Scott.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: Janet!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Dr Scott!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Janet!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rocky!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen! I made you, and I can break you just
as easily.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: Master, dinner is prepared.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Under the circumstances, formal dress is to
be optional.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Food has always played a vital role in
life’s rituals. The breaking of bread - the last meal of the condemned
man - and now this meal. However informal it might appear you can be
sure there was to be very little ‘bonhomie’.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A toast to absent friends.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Absent friends.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: We came here to discuss Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Eddie!</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; janet</strong>: Dr. Scott!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say doctor von
Scott.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What exactly are you implying?</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: That’s alright Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: But Doctor Scott…</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: From the day he was born, he was
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But he never caused her Nothing but
shame.</p>
<p><strong>122/ int. dining room night</strong>: 133 DR. SCOTT produces
scrapbook, opening it at a picture of Eddie’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: He left home the day she died.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Was rock and roll,</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: When Eddie said He didn’t like his teddy You
knew he was a no good kid.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What a guy</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Makes you cry</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Und I did.</p>
<p><strong>134/ int. columbia’s room night</strong>: 135 She has a large
portrait of EDDIE on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: Everybody shoved him, I very nearly loved
him. I said, hey listen to me, Stay sane inside insanity. But he locked
the door And threw away the key.</p>
<p><strong>136/ int. dining room night</strong>: 137</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Making him warn, me, In a note</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: What’s it say, What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m out of my head Oh hurry, or I may be
dead. They mustn’t carry out their evil deeds, Yaaaow.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: When Eddie said he didn’t like his teddy You
knew he was a no good kid.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Und when he threatened your life With a
switch blade knife</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What guy</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Makes you cry</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Eddie!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: When Eddie said he didn’t like his teddy You
knew he was a no good kid.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What a guy</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Woe woe woe</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Makes you cry</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hey hey hey</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Und I did</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh Rocky, how could you!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll tell you once, Won’t tell you twice
You’d better wise up Janet Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve laid the seed It should be all you
need.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: When we made it Did ya hear a bell ring?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Y’got a block, Take my advice. You’d better
wise up, Janet Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The transducer Will seduce yah.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: My feet - I can’ move my feet.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: My wheels - My God, I can’t move my
wheels.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s as if we were glued to the spot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You are - so quake with fear, you tiny
fools.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: We’re trapped.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: You won’t find earth people quite the
easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, I suppose, some
kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device….</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You mean…</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Yes Brad. It’s something we ourselves
have been working on. But it seems our friend here has found a way of
perfecting it. A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter
and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even
time itself!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You mean he’s gonna send us to another
planet?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Planet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’d better wise up, Janet Weiss. You’d
better wise up, Build your thighs up. You’d better wise up.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Then she cries out -</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Sto-o-o-o-o-op.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You’re a hot dog But you’d better not Try to
hurt her, Frank Furter.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: You’re a hot dog But you’d better not Try
to hurt her, Frank Furter.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You’re a hot dog…</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: My God! I can’t take any more of this -
first you spurn me for Eddie, then you cast him off like an old overcoat
for Rocky. You chew people up and then spit them out - I loved you, do
you hear me - I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - I’ll tell you - a
big nothing. You’re like a sponge. You take, take, take, take! You drain
others of their love and emotions. Well, I’ve had enough. You’ve got to
choose between me and Rocky - so named because of the rocks in his
head.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s not easy having a good time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My children turn on me. Rocky’s behaving just
as Eddie did. Maybe I made a mistake in splitting his brain between the
two of them.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: When will we return to Transylvania? I grow
weary of this world.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and
your brother RIff Raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as
yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me I
can be quite generous.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: I ask for nothing, Master.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you shall receive it - in abundance.
Come. We are ready for the floor show. Our guests will be growing
restless.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And so, by some extraordinary coincidence
- fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that
appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a
situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a
few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both
tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a
man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities
were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor
show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it
was clear that this was to be no picnic.</p>
<p><strong>columbia</strong>: It was great when it all began I was a
regular Frank fan. But it was over when he had the plan To start working
on a muscle-man. Now the only thing that gives me hope Is my love of a
certain dope Rose tints my world keeps me Safe from my trouble and
pain.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: I’m just seven hours old Truly beautiful to
behold And somebody should be told My libido hasn’t been controlled Now
the only thing I’ve come to trust Is an orgasmic�rush of lust Rose tints
my world keeps me Safe from my trouble and pain.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s beyond me Help me Mommy I’ll be good
you’ll see Take this dream away What’s this, let’s see I feel sexy
What’s come over me Here it comes again.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I feel released Bad times deceased My
confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind
has been expanded It’s a gas that Frankie’s landed His lust is so
sincere.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate
satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I
wanted to be dressed just the same.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh Erotic nightmares Beyond any
measure And sensual daydreams To treasure forever.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Don’t dream it. Be it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Ach, we’ve got to get out of this trap
before this decadence saps our wills. I’ve got to be strong and try to
hang on. Or else my mind, may well snap.</p>
<p><strong>dr. scott</strong>: Und my life will be lived, For the
thri-i-i-i-ill…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s beyond me Help me Mo-ommy.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My my my my I’m a wild and an untamed thing.
I’m a bee with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping. Your
heart’ll thump and your blood will sing. So let the party and the sounds
rock on. Gonna shake it till the life has gone.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I’m a wild and an untamed thing I’m a bee with
a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping Your heart’ll thump
and your blood will sing.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Frank N. Furter It’s all over Your
mission is a failure.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait! I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: On the day I went away.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Goodbye</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Was all I had to say</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Now I</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Want to come again and stay</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Oh my, my,</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Smile and that will mean I may</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve seen blue skies Through the tears in my
eyes And I realise I’m going home I’m going home</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Feeling</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Like I’m outside in the rain</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Wheeling</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Free to try and find a game</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Dealing</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: How sentimental.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: And also presumptuous of you. You see
when I said “we” were to return to Transylvania, I referred only to
Magenta and myself.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: You see, you are to remain here, in
spirit anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: Great Heavens, that’s a laser.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Yes, Dr Scott. A laser capable of
emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You mean you’re going to kill him? What’s his
crime?</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: You saw what became of Eddie. Society must
be protected.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Exactly, Dr Scott. Now Frank N. Furter,
your time has come. Say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do your worse - inferior one.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You’ve killed them.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: I thought you liked them. They liked
you.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: They didn’t like me. They never liked
me.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: You did right.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: A decision had to be made.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: You’re OK by me.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Dr Scott I’m sorry about your nephew.</p>
<p><strong>dr scott</strong>: Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: You must leave now Dr Scott while it’s
still possible. We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet
of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: Our noble mission is almost completed my
most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores
of our “androgenous” planet.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to
sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the
right…</p>
<p><strong>riff raff</strong>: But it’s the pelvic thrust that really
drives you insane.</p>
<p><strong>magenta</strong>: And our World will do the Time Warp
again.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’ve done a lot God knows I’ve tried To find
the truth I’ve even lied But all I know is down inside.</p>
<p><strong>brad &amp; dr scott</strong>: I’m bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: And super heroes Come to feast To taste the
flesh Not yet deceased And al I know Is still the beast</p>
<p><strong>trio</strong>: Is feeding.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And crawling on the planet’s face Some
insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And
