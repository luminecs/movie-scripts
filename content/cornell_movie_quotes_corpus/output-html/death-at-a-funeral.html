<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: MUSIC CUE: “DON’T WORRY, BE HAPPY” by
Bobby McFerrin plays as we</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: The music fades out. TIGHT SHOT on AARON
thirties, dressed in a black suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with
a somber expression. The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR
UNDERTAKERS place a coffin on a raised platform.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The living room has been prepared for
the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Would you like to see… Aaron nods his head
“yes”, as BRIAN begins to open the coffin. Aaron crosses to the coffin.
There’s a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces
himself for what he’s about to see. The coffin opens and Aaron stares
long and hard at the body.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Brian… who is that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Who is this man I’m looking at? ’Cause it’s
not my father.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Are you asking me if I’m sure I know what my
father looks like?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: People make mistakes in times of grief.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into
the coffin. We see it’s an ASIAN MAN.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh shit! The other undertakers look
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks
like. He used to take you to little league.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m sorry, man. I got a little nervous. This
almost never happens.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s happened before?! You mean this is a
normal thing?… This isn’t Burger King. You can’t just mess up my
order.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I think I know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You think?</p>
<p>****: That’s not my father.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I better .,see my dad in this coffin in an
hour, or you’re going to take his place. The undertakers pick up the
coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll get him, man.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p>****: My people, my people, my people…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: They brought the wrong body. Can you believe
that?</p>
<p>****: The wrong body?! Do they know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: They think so. They’re getting him now. The
thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I told you not to use Marshals. But no,
you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a little
more, but at least they know where the bodies are. Michelle writes
something down on a piece of paper as Aaron crosses the room and sits on
the bed.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You were right. Please don’t rub it in, not
today. I’ve got so much to worry about. Michelle gets up and heads to
the bathroom as Aaron takes out some index cards and looks them
over.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dad insisted on having the funeral here,
Mom’s crying all the time, Ryan didn’t help with anything, not like he
ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I can’t wait until this day is
over.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh come on, honey. I’m sure it’s not that
bad.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: If it is, at least Dad’s too dead to hear it.
Michelle exits the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Honey, it’s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I write. All anybody’s
going to be thinking is “why isn’t Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I’m going
to be thinking it. She holds him close.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Baby, you’re the oldest. You have to do
the eulogy. Besides, I think you’re just as good a writer as your
brother. You just need to let someone read your book. Aaronlooks
away.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Soon. It’s not ready to be read yet.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’m sure it’s fine. Once the funeral’s
over, and everything dies</p>
<p><strong>down–</strong>: Aaron gives her a look.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Sorry. Look, once this is all over, you
know your mom’s thinking about selling the house, so you know we’ve got
to get out.of here. Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You called them, right? Silence from Aaron
in the next room.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Aaron?… You put the down payment on the
condo, right?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I said I’d take care of it and I’ll take care
of it. Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You better, because I can’t live with your
mother anymore. I’ve done my time, now it’s time for your brother to
take over. From now on, it’s only Christmas and birthdays for us. Once
we move, we can concentrate on your writing and our baby. Michelle gets
down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron’s pants. Aaron pulls
back.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We have to do
this today? Michelle is still on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yes. Today’s the last day of this
cycle.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Can I at least find the body first?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I hate funerals. It’s all death, death,
death.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t think funerals are designed for
anybody to really like.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t want a regular funeral. When I die,
I want people to celebrate my life.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not me. I want it to be the saddest day ever.
I want the stock market to stop. Schools to close. And no garbage
pick-up. Derek starts to light a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You still smoke?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You used to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I used to piss my pants too, but I stopped.
The only thing I want black is my skin. At least open the window. Derek
opens the window very slightly.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ve got enough problems of my own to deal
with.</p>
<p>****: Yeah? What problems?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I told you… About the rash…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Got to use condoms.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: .on my hand…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Still got to use condoms.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Look at it. Norman pulls up his sleeve and
makes Derek look at his wrist, but he doesn’t take a great deal of
interest.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s not a rash.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know, but it doesn’t look right.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, damn. Norman continues to drive. Derek
continues to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: If you hate funerals so much why are you
coming?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You know why.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I can’t. She’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: So you’re going to win her back over a dead
body?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If I have to.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yeah, just a little nervous…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: About seeing my dad?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I just don’t think I’ve ever been so openly
hated by anyone before.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He doesn’t hate you. He just loved
Derek.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Great. That makes me feel much better.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: At least you know it’s not you, so try not
to get so nervous when he’s around.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I can’t help it. He puts me on edge. I feel
like I owe him money.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He’s going to be more.concerned that his
brother-in-law just died. He won’t be focused on you. Anyway, when I
tell him we’re getting married, he’ll have to accept you. Elaine takes
his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar takes his eyes off the
road for just a brief moment. Suddenly there’s a BUMP!!! And we see a
bicyclist flying over Oscar’s car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump
out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oh my God. Are you okay? The guy gets up.
He’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>bike guy</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Are you sure? Is anything broken? I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bike guy</strong>: It was my fault. I ran a light. Oscar
starts hyperventilating.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I could have killed you. What if you had
cracked your head open? I’d have blood on my hands! Elaine shakes
him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, calm down!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You heard the man, he ran a light. Come on,
let’s get out of here before he wants to sue. She grabs him and pulls
him into the car.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What’s taking you so long?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I just started.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You want this baby as much me. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: If I didn’t want you to come, you would
have done it five minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Do I have to do this today? The door opens
and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Who’s picking up Uncle Russell?– Aaron
and Elaine quickly pull apart. As the Housekeeper steps back out into
the hall.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh shit, Uncle Russell. Aaron fixes his pants
as he exits the room.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hello?… How are you?… Okay..</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Uncle Russell?! Damn! He’s always in a bad
mood.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s not a mood if he’s always in it. It’s
his personality. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright… ’Alright. I’ll do it. See you soon.
Bye. Norman hangs up irritated.</p>
<p>****: So is this your father?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Come on, man. You know that’s my father.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Just trying to be professional. What up,
Michelle?</p>
<p>****: Brian.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He closes the lid and all four
undertakers quietly head off. Aaron looks up and sees his mother,
Cynthia, has entered the room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She
stares at the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Mom, how are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: There were so many things we wanted to do…
We were going to go to China.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: China? You don’t even like Chinese food.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: That’s not the point. I haven’t been
feeling good. Who knows how long I’m going to live without him. It
happens all the time. One spouse goes and then the next. I mean, it
might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of
everything.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Cynthia, I– They all cross to the
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Come on, Mom. You’re healthy. You’ll be fine.
You’ve got your friends and family… Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand
around the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Where is Ryan? Have you heard from him?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He’ll be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Just seeing that boy’s face makes me feel
better. I’ve missed him so much. My baby.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She looks down at the coffin. Aaron
turns away frustrated. Michelle gently touches the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Do you need anything, Cynthia?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah, you can get your hand off my
husband’s coffin. You’re leaving smudge marks. Michelle tries to wipe it
off with her sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: “PAPER PLANE” by M.I.A. Elaine and Oscar are
walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, I found them. The ones in the Valium
bottle?… Yeah… I’ll get them to you this evening… Can’t do this
afternoon… It’s your fault you left them here… I’ve got a funeral… My
uncle died… Yeah, tragic… No, I haven’t taken any. I saw what they did
to you… What are they anyway?… The doorbell rings.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ve gotta go, my sister’s here… I’ll take
them with me and stop by after the funeral… Bye. The doorbell rings
again.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hang on! Jeff stands up and we see that he’s
only half dressed for the funeral. He doesn’t have any pants on.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He puts the bottle on the counter then
crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you always open the door half naked? Come
on, Jeff. We’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ve just got to put my pants on and I’m
ready. Oscar is still a little shaky.</p>
<p>****: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar’s freaked out. A guy on a bike ran
into the car.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: It came out of nowhere. I didn’t see him. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s okay, baby. Go put your damn pants
on.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m going. I’m going. Jeff heads off to the
bathroom and closes the door. Elaine spots the bottle of Valium on the
table and picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Here. Take this..: It’ll calm you down.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s just Valium. I used to take them all
the time… It’ll make you feel better, promise.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Are you sure? I mean, I’ve got to drive.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’ll be okay. I’ll drive, honey. Come on,
open wide. She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water.
Oscar swallows. Jeff returns wearing pants.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ready. Let’s do it. Oscar and Elaine leave,
Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium bottle, puts it in his pocket,
then follows them out.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hello! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ryan! Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings
her arms around him. Aaron looks a bit lost in the background with
Michelle but they walk over.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I know this is hard, Mom. But you’re going to
be okay.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You always know exactly what to say, Ryan.
I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m always here for you, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I guess if people died every week, we’d see
you all the time. Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: How was the flight?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay. I had to buy the seat next to me because
I don’t trust the airlines with my bags. And there was a lot of
turbulence… I guess that’s the thing about flying first class. It
doesn’t matter how much you pay if the plane crashes, you still end up
dead– uh… Ryan realizes what he’s said and stops speaking abruptly. It’s
too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: “End up dead”?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh damn.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’ll make sure she’s okay. Michelle heads
off upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You didn’t tell me the guy was in a
wheelchair. UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his
chair. Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls
down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his
face.</p>
<p>****: Hello, Uncle Russell. How are you? We’re here to take you to
the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Where the fuck have you been, you fat
bastard? You’re late. If you took any longer I’d be dead, too. The fake
smile falls off Norman’s face.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s hard to see Dad like this. But he’s in a
better place now.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: When does dead beat sick?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I guess you’re right. This is why I try not to
get close to people. There’s too much emotion involved.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well that explains why you never call.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you want me to say? Some families talk
to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals. That’s
us.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I guess it is.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs
flanking the coffin. Aaron sits as well.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: By the way, I’m going to need that money.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What money?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The money for all this… the funeral. You’re
supposed to pay half.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What about the insurance?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That’s Mom’s money.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What about the pension?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That’s Mom’s money.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So we’re spliting the cost.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are we?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yes. We are.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t have it right now.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What do you mean, you don’t have it? You just
bought a first class seat for your bag.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And that’s why I don’t have any cash.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So, poor old Uncle Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yeah. But he was sick for so long. He’s much
better off now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Dead? Since when does dead beat sick?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Shut up, Jeff. Jeff turns his attention to
Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I love when you come to family functions,
Oscar. Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you. There’s no response
from Oscar. He looks distantly out the window. The pills are starting to
kick in.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Was there a dog in here just now? Elaine
looks at Oscar very-strangely.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What? He sniffs.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Dalmatian? No, Schnauzer… A beat.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What the hell are you talking about? Oscar
falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There’s nowhere to park. Then the small
flower delivery van pulls out. Derek points out the newly empty
space.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That truck is pulling out. Park there.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright. Just as he’s about to drive in,
another car takes it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Elaine, I was going to park there.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you family, Norman?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Well, no, but I’m like family.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No such thing. Derek leans out the
window.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hi, Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Your father invited me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh please. She grabs Oscar and heads to the
house followed by Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Did you see that?… She totally blew me off.
The flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward. It’s driver
beeps the horn.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I said what’s happening? Are we
there?. Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Aw, damn. I have Uncle Russell. How could I
forget about Uncle Russell? Derek has other concerns and the van beeps
again.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yeah, alright!!</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What the hell is going on? Uncle
Russell pokes Norman with his cane.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: .barely even looked.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Norman, now highly irritated, is forced
to drive backwards.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: It’s very green here, isn’t it?… Green… Very
green… Very… green. Elaine takes Oscar to the side.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: All this talking about phantom dogs and
things being green… What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What are you talking about? I’ fine . Never
been greener. Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Elaine, what’s wrong with Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know. Something’s not right…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I think it’s the Valium.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Valium?!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I gave him a Valium at your place. I think
he’s just not used to it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jeff’s face reveals his realization of
what’s happened. He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: You’re going the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ow! That hurts.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stop the car, Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stop the car. I have to speak with her. I
have to speak with Elaine. Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets
out.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What about Uncle Russell? I need help with
Uncle Russell! It’s too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman
honks the horn.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What’s going on here? Where are we?!
We’re going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ow! Can you please stop doing that?! The van
keeps beeping. Norman backs up.</p>
<p>****: Nice to see you again. The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then
walks away.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Who are all these people? I don’t even
recognize half of them.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s your family. You don’t recognize them
from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: So what side of the family is he on?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The guy in the leather jacket. Ryan looks
around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN approaching the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad’s from
work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So, you’re telling me I’m going to have to
pay for the whole funeral?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No I’m telling you you’ll have the money in a
few months when I get my advance.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND
DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Aaron, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yes, um… We’re just waiting for everyone to
arrive, then we can get going. I know you’re in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Yes, I have two more funerals and a
Christening. I don’t know what it is about the Spring, but they’re
either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look
at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to
Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Have you met my brother, Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Ah, the writer, of course. I must
admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I’m reading
“Mama’s Secret” right now. Don’t tell anybody, I’m not supposed to be
reading that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m sure the Lord will forgive you. Aaron is
irritated.</p>
<p>****: You must be very proud of your big brother. He really made
something of his life.</p>
<p>****: I can’t wait to hear your eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No, no, I’m doing the eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Oh. I thought…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron is the oldest. The reverend tries her
best not to look disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Great… Well, I’ll just make sure
have everything I need.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She looks at the coffin and then at the
Bible in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: We’ve got a body and a Bible. Well,
I’m all set. She walks off.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Look, I think you should do the eulogy.
Everyone’s expecting you to do it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, they’re not. You’re the oldest. You should
do it.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Look most of the people are here for Dad, but
let’s not kid ourselves. A lot of them are here to hear your eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: So imagine how surprised they’ll be when they
hear yours. Ryan walks away.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: How’s my little sister?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’m trying to hold it together, Duncan. He
was a really good husband. My friends always told me about the crap
their husbands put them through. I never had to deal with any of that.
Remember when Uncle Matt got that nanny pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: That was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: They don’t make ’em like my Edward anymore.
A good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys. Michelle
cringes in the background.</p>
<p>****: I’ll make you a cup of coffee, Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Coffee can do many things Michelle, but it
can’t bring back the dead. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Tea?</p>
<p>****: “My father was an exceptional man… My father was an exceptional
man… My father was an exceptional man…” Michelle approaches him.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Honey, we still need to finish that thing.
Remember today is the last day.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Can we talk about this when there’s a little
less death in the air?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No. No we can’t.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Honey, I’m just not in the mood…</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I don’t have any panties on.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What? You don’t have any panties on? It’s my
father’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’m just trying to help you out. I’ll put
them back on before the service starts. Now come on. They turn. Aaron
looks around the corner into the living room and sees the four foot six
man standing by a table. Aaron stops Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Babe, don’t make it obvious, but that guy in
the leather jacket standing by the wall. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t
look. Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Do you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Isn’t that the guy from the Home
Depot?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No, I don’t think so. Don’t look. Don’t
look.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Did he put in the cable?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No, no, that’s not it. He keeps looking at
me. Don’t look. Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: He’s probably just a friend of your
father’s. I’ll meet you in the garage. We have a few minutes before
Uncle Russell gets here. Michelle walks off. Aaron peeks around the
corner again and makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who
seems to be staring straight at him. Aaron averts his eyes and heads
off.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What are you doing?! Be careful with
that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Hurry up, we’re late. Norman slams
the trunk closed.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: God damn, that Martina has grown up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Are you talking about Little Martina?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She was like a teenager when I left, and now
she’s… you know. She’s like damn. Aaron looks distastefully at his
brother.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Can you keep an eye out for Uncle
Russell?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I think I should go see how she’s been.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah, why don’t you do that? See if she wants
a juice box.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron
continues across the room.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hi there. Aaron turns and finds himself
cornered by Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was really sorry to hear about your dad. He
talked about you a lot. I saw your wedding pictures. Your wife’s dress
was very beautiful. Aaron is a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Uh… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did he ever mention me?… Frank? Frank steps
forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Frank?… I don’t think so, no… Were you a
friend of his?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Something like that, yeah. Michelle sticks
her head out of the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Honey. Can I see you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming.
Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up
a hill.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Come on, put your back into it.
You’re supposed to be a young man. Don’t you have any strength?</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: I think we should get started.
really have to leave at three.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Sure. Can we just wait five minutes for my
Uncle Russell? We can’t start without him.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: .Of course.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s so nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m so sorry to hear about your uncle. But
he’s in a better place now. I hear Ryan is doing the eulogy. Oscar,
carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Look… Isn’t it beautiful? He wanders off
again. Elaine doesn’t know what the hell is going on.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Elaine, can I speak to you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine’s arm
with some urgency and moves off to the side.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What? What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I have to tell you something and, I’m warning
you in advance, you’re not going to like it. Elaine looks at Jeff
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Aaron. How are we doing on time?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we’ll be
ready to start.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So what’s this I hear about Ryan not doing
the eulogy?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I was just telling him how much I’m looking
forward to hearing your eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: That’s a shame. I mean, I’m sure you’ll be
good, Aaron. It’s just with Ryan being the writer of the family…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: There are people here that don’t even know
your father. They just came to hear Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Would you excuse me? Aaron walks away.</p>
<p>****: So any new books coming out? I just finished “Black Hurt.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Every single person wants Ryan to do the
eulogy. He was my father, too. I’m supposed to do the damn eulogy! I’m
the oldest. Where was Ryan when I was taking care of Dad?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Calm down. Calm down. Forget about
everyone. You’re going to do the eulogy and it’s going to be the best
eulogy anyone’s every heard. Now could you please do me a favor and get
me pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Come on, do I have to do this today?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yes. What do you want? You want me to talk
dirty? I’m gonna suck it. I’m gonna to suck it. Before Michelle can
continue her PG rated dirty talk, there is a knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is there more soda in here?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yes! Come in! Michelle is frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What do you mean it’s not Valium?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I mean what you thought was Valium, wasn’t
actually Valium. It’s a hallucinogenic. Like, acid, mescaline… Special
K… Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine looks at
him. He’s making strange contorted expressions with his face and
pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to notice him and think
he’s slightly odd.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: This isn’t funny, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not being funny. Look at him, he’s high as
a kite! Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What the hell are you doing leaving that
stuff around your house?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A friend left it. And who the hell just goes
into someone’s house and takes pills?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I thought they were Valium! What am I
supposed to do? Should I tell him?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, don’t do that. It’ll just freak him out…
We’ll just keep a close eye on him, and make sure he doesn’t get out of
control… And don’t let him spend too long talking to one person… or
bush. Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him.
Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see this and
follows as well.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hi, Dad. How are you? She gives him a
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not bad considering we’re at a funeral. Jeff
steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hi, Dad. He shakes his hand.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: How’s Pepperdine treating you? Is Professor
Clarke still giving you a hard time?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no. It’s all worked out. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m not worried about you. Duncan looks
pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So I see you brought your friend.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He’s my boyfriend. And you know his name.
Derek approaches.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Doctor, how nice to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Derek. How are you doing at the
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Great. Great. We should have lunch soon. I’d
love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar’s.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like to join
us for lunch? They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away
disgusted. Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello.
Oscar stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Elaine… Jeff… good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m so sorry, Auntie. We’re going to miss
Uncle Edward so much.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah. He was a great guy.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, this is my Aunt– Oscar grabs Cynthia
in a tight hug.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m so sorry about… the death… He sings
“Amazing Grace” softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That
saved a wretch like me… Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads
back outside. Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after
Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t leave. Aunt Cynthia
would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He
rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You look nice, Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m dressed for a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah, but you make death look sexy. She looks
at him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So, I heard about the engagement.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hey, hey. I don’t really have time to deal
with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad
yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sure. Anything for you. Derek looks over and
notices Oscar looking bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So that’s him? That’s the man you’re going to
spend the rest of your life with? Elaine looks over at the drugged up
Oscar. Oscar leans over like he’s on a nod. Jeff leans down with him,
watching. Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then
he starts walking.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yep, that’s him. Oscar who has been walking
in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies
by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Elaine., I- Elaine follows the guys, leaving
Derek behind.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: My father was an exceptional man… My father
was– Frank again approaches Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Actually, there’s something I’d like to talk
to you about… when you have a minute. Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah, that’s great. Do you mind if we do it
later though? My uncle just got here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure. Aaron heads off.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thank you, Derek, you’re a life saver. Hope
it wasn’t too much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No problem at all. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell
inside.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: How are you doing, Uncle Russell?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Terrible. Derek follows, leaving
Norman standing there out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Can I get a little help?</p>
<p><strong>reverend.davis</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, could you all
kindly take your seats? We’re about to begin the service. Ryan helps
Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar. Elaine grabs Oscar and
drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell to his place.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Move! Move! He pokes people with his
cane. Aaron then takes his seat with Michelle. Oscar is not looking so
good. Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his
seat. Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating,
pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for the
disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of everyone. Norman
takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans away.</p>
<p>****: You stink.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Family and friends, we’re gathered
here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle
Russell up that damn hill all by myself. Then took all the credit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Elaine, turns around.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Norman, shut up. Elaine turns back around.
Norman is irritated by this.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: I’d like to start with a favorite
passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King
James Bible.</p>
<p>****: “And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and
would let him go no more home to his father’s house…” While the reverend
is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the shoulder and leans forward.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Elaine, I know you don’t think I’m part of the family–</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: ’Cause you’re not.</p>
<p>****: .but when you dissed me back there, I had Uncle Russell in the
car. Aaron, disturbed by Norman’s whispering, looks over.</p>
<p>****: You stole my parking space, and I had to push him half a mile
up a hill. We almost missed the service! Aaronlooks over again.</p>
<p>****: Look, Norman, if you poke me one more time, I’m going to kick
your ass.</p>
<p>****: What the hell is going on?!</p>
<p>****: She stole my parking space!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Stole your parking space?!. My father’s dead!
Act right. Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: .”Then Jonathan and David made a
covenant, because he loved him as his own soul…” As she speaks, Norman
looks at his wrist, worried. The woman sitting next to him smacks his
wrist down.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar.
Oscar is fidgeting and looking worried.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks
worried.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: .”And Jonathan stripped himself of
the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even
to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control
him.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: And now we’ll have a few words from
Edward’s son, Aaron. Ryan’s older brother.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle
gives Aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees
Frank staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Uncle Russell.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Why isn’t Ryan doing the eulogy? This
is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aaron arrives at the front and looks out
across the expectant crowd. He’s extremely nervous.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for
coming… I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he’s got more
friends now that he’s dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia
looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly.
Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his
notes out.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: My father was an exceptional man… He was born
in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in
the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their
summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the
lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy
is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like “what can I do?” Jeff looks
more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks
like he’s going to burst.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dad’s first job was working after school as
an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks
weren’t allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot.
Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad
what his first boss was like… The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar.
He suddenly grabs Elaine’s arm. Aaron keeps talking.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Did you just see that?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: The coffin just moved.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m telling you I saw it move. Aaron becomes
vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: .He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly
well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with
his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know
that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never
saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a
decision which lead to a career in corporate finance… But his real
passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance
and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and
contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar’s
protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a
disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: There, look. It happened again.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, please- People start looking at
Oscar, who’s becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like
someone on acid.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: That coffin’s moving!</p>
<p>****: Oscar. Just calm down. Aaron looks over to Oscar.</p>
<p>****: The coffin’s moving! Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches
silently. Oscar jumps up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die
from embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: There’s someone alive in there!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her
and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in
astonishment, including Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine tries to
hold Oscar back, but she can’t.</p>
<p>****: Oscar, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: There’s someone moving in there. Can’t you
see? Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to restrain
him, but can’t. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to help.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you?!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Ryan, no!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan
stands up and tries to help.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Get away from there!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: No, I have to show you! He’s alive! He’s
alive! The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and
struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over.
The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia.
Cynthia screams. Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through
the kitchen. The living room is left in chaos.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s alright, Cynthia. It’s alright. She
sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry, he just
marches out.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Please let me extend my apologies to you all.
I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but
everything will be… returned… to it’s proper place. Please enjoy the
refreshments, and we’ll call you when we’re ready to continue.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: It wouldn’t have happened if Ryan had
done the eulogy. Aaron exits through the garden door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Elaine, what the hell was that?!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m so sorry, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh, okay. My dead father’s sprawled out on
the living room floor, but it’s okay, you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: But the coffin was moving.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I’ll explain
later. An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house.
He’s almost to the door when Michelle arrives.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No, I haven’t made the call about the down
payment yet.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I wasn’t going to say that.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No I’m not going to have sex with you.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I wasn’t going to say that.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What were you going to say?</p>
<p>****: Hi. He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there. Duncan
comes out and heads for Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’ll kill him! Elaine tries to keep Duncan
away from Oscar, who is stressed enough and looks terrified.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Dad, leave it alone!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Leave it alone?! He just knocked my
brother-in-law out of his coffin.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It wasn’t his fault.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I can’t
believe you brought this idiot! I don’t ever want to see him again, do
you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Because we’re… moving in together. Duncan
looks over at Oscar, who looks like he’s just seen a ghost. He’s
struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who’s doing his best to look
after him.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Dad, this isn’t actually what he’s like. He
took some drugs and–</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Drugs?! Is he on the pipe?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with
Elaine not to tell on him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No he’s not on the pipe. He took some Valium
and had a.bad reaction. Jeff looks grateful.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Valium?! That’s not a Valium high. Your
mother was on Valium for forty years. She never knocked over a
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Dad, please.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I just want to point out that you won’t see
Derek knocking over a coffin.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not right now, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Fine. I’ve got to check on Cynthia, but this
isn’t over. Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar
who is hugging a tree.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Come and sit down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Are you alright?… That was insane. He just
fell out the coffin like a dead fish. I guess its not much of a metaphor
when you’re talking about a dead human, but–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aaron looks at Norman.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Norman, please.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh yeah… Sorry. It’s just that you never
know when it’s your time. Like, I have this weird thing on my wrist.
I’ve had it for a few weeks now. I don’t know what it is–</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Why don’t you show it to my Uncle Duncan?
He’s a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: He is? Great. Thanks. Norman walks off
toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to
Martina.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I read your last book, “Black
Hurt.”</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Good, good. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I’m not giving you a compliment you
arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn’t wipe my ass with
it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I swear it was moving. I must be losing my
mind… Why are my hands so big?!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you
something… Elaine sits him down on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Now… You remember I gave you some Valium
earlier?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well it turns out that it wasn’t actually
Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the
background.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p>****: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad time,
but I’ve got this thing on my hand. I’ve had it for weeks now… Duncan is
looking at Norman incredulously.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What do you think it is? Cynthia stands
up.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Duncan, I’m going back now. She exits.
Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You should probably go see a dermatologist.
He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Really? Why? What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t know. It looks like some kind of
pigment mutation. Duncan walks further out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Pigment mutation?! Duncan turns again.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re probably just allergic to something.
Maybe from shellfish, nuts… Duncan heads further out of the room, but
Norman won’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Nuts? What kind of nuts? Duncan turns around
again.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I don’t know. Pecans? Peanuts?… Excuse me.
Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and terrified.</p>
<p>****: A pigment mutation?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you understand? Hallucinogenic. Oscar
recoils. He turns to Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, now, the best thing to do is relax and
just go with the flow. Try and enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff
by the lapels. We see the bottle of “Valium” falls out of his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! She tries to pull him off Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: How long does it last?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know… eight hours?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Eight hours?! Of this?!!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar let go. She pulls him off Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Derek watching from the window.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Derek smoothing his hair seeing his
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Oscar runs inside. Elaine follows with
Jeff in tow.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! Come back. They head into the
house.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh, hi, Elaine. You following me? She just
runs right past, then Jeff rushes past following Elaine. Oscar pushes
through people.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Elaine grabs Oscar and leads him to the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Excuse me. He’s going to be sick. They head
up the stairs with Jeff following.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar. Oscar grabs the hair-dryer and wields
it like a gun.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Stand back!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, put down the dryer.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Get back or I’ll blow your head off. Oscar
backs Elaine out of the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, please– Oscar shuts the door and
locks it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, are you okay? She tries to open the
door, but it’s locked. Jeff walks up checking his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, let me in.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jeff realizes he lost the pill
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar. Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh… Elaine… I can’t find the pill bottle? But
Elaine is too busy to hear.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! Open the door. Jeff looks at the
floor as he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Okay. Breathe.</p>
<p>****: It’s going to be okay. Breathe. You’re and investment banker.
You’ve handled mergers for billion dollar companies. You can do this.
Dead bodies don’t move. They don’t move. But that body was moving. It
was moving. Then he slaps himself.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Snap out of it! You can handle this. You can
do this. He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Alright. You’re okay. Stay calm… Stay calm…
Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: That’s it, Oscar, keep it together. K.I.T.
Keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. Everything’s going to be
fine. Nothing moved. Dead people don’t move. They’re stiff. They don’t
move, do they?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Easy now. Easy now. We can do this. A few
hours. That’s nothing. No sweat. I mean you’ve already been in here for…
He looks at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Where’s my watch?! He sees it’s on the other
wrist.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oh! He checks the time.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: It’s already been…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Open the door. Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Five minutes. Suddenly the pressure of. the
situation overtakes him.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: God damn! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s alright. Aaron turns around not knowing
what to do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Grief does strange things to people. Aaron
looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you remember, I have something to talk to
you about.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is there somewhere private we could go?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Sure. They walk away. The screaming continues
as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his
steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you writing a novel?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Uh… yeah. Aaron takes the manuscript and
moves it away.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Like your big brother.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Actually I’m the oldest. I was writing
before.he was. I’ve had a few pieces published in the New Yorker. But
now I’m mainly teaching.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh. Well, you must be very proud of your
brother then. Getting all his novels published. Aaron decides to move
the conversation on.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So anyway. What did you want to talk about?
He motions for Frank to take a seat and sits across from him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Your father and I were very… close.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah. Okay. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And we spent a lot of time together.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy. Frank takes an
envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and takes some photos from the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Um… I’ve got some photos I want to show
you.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Sure. Frank passes the first photo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s me and your Dad in Central Park in New
York. Aaron looks at the photo curiously.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s us on Santa Monica Boulevard on
Halloween… Aaron takes the next one, becoming more suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So, where did you and my dad meet?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just around.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Ahhh. He smacks his lips together and then
opens his mouth and waits for the next drop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s one of me and your father going to the
premiere of “Dreamgirls”. I was dressed as Deena and your father had to
be Effie. Aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So… I mean you have all these pictures, but
he never said anything about you. This is the first I’m</p>
<p><strong>seeing of–</strong>: Frank gives Aaron a knowing look.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: How did you know my father? Aaron looks
around the room. There is a copy of “People Magazine” sexiest men issue
on the table. He sees figurines of male ballet dancers. It’s getting
clearer. He sees three Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There’s a
signed Kathy Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it.
Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh Jackman.
Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh God… Aaron jumps up and closes the study
door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you really that shocked? Frank gestures
around the room.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sure he would have eventually
told you, but I guess he wasn’t sure how you’d react. Aaron shakes in
disgust.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Uugg. Like this. Aaron gathers his senses. He
has a thought and turns to Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Does my mother know?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. And there’s no reason why she should…
Just as long as I get what’s owed to me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A long pause. Aaron looks over at
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: “What’s owed to you”?</p>
<p><strong>frank .</strong>: Well, obviously I should get something… I
mean, your dad and I were lovers, and he left me absolutely nothing in
his will. How do you think that makes me feel? Aaron fails to respond,
because he’s in too much shock.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll tell you how it makes me feel cheap.
Like some cheap piece of ass… I mean, I’m entitled to something.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What I want is a lot, but I’m not asking you
for what I want. I deserve thirty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thirty thousand dollars?! I can’t just give
you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids–</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Your father told me you were having
trouble…</p>
<p>****: Look, your father promised to take care of me, and I made
sacrifices to keep him happy. Aaron gets angry.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You think you can come in here, slander my
father’s name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up
going to see “Dreamgirls”? I saw “Dreamgirls” twice. I’m not gay. That’s
not proof of anything… “Steppin’ to the bad side / Gonna take a mean
ride.”</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against
the wall.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m not giving you anything but a– Frank
pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron’s face. Aaron,releases
Frank and snatches the picture.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now I don’t want to, but I will show these
photos to your mother… Do you really want me to do that today?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Wait here. He exits the study.</p>
<p><strong>middle aged man</strong>: Aaron, I was just telling George
here how when we were boys together your dad used to love to make us all
go skinny dipping. Aaron just stares at them. Then he moves toward the
living room.</p>
<p>****: Oh God, oh God, oh God… He’s looking around for Ryan, but
there’s no sign-. -Michelle watches Aaron walk around the room.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar. Open the door. Derek arrives behind
her and leans in close.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Anything I can do to help?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not really, thanks. Derek moves over to face
her and leans his arm on the door very coolly.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I guess you’ve got it under control. Elaine
ignores him and continues banging on the door.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar? Anguished noises emanate from the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So what are you doing after the funeral? I’ve
got Maxwell tickets.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Look… I’m busy. I don’t have time for your
shit. Now get the hell away from me! Derek looks hurt and storms
off.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: .so you’ve never been to New York?</p>
<p><strong>martina</strong>: I’ve been with my parents once.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, that’s not really seeing New York. You
have to come visit me. When’s your birthday?</p>
<p><strong>martina</strong>: I turn eighteen next month.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Great. All star weekend is in New York this
year.</p>
<p><strong>martina</strong>: I know. I know. Aaron approaches.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Ryan, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Not now, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Give me five minutes. Aaron pulls him
away.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What are you doing? What is it? Aaron lowers
his voice.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That guy that was here before, that we didn’t
recognize…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: The guy in the leather jacket?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What about him? Aaron lowers his voice
further.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well, I was just with him in the study, and…
and he showed me some pictures…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: So? He showed you some picture? What’s wrong
with that? I’m busy…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Pictures of him and Dad together at the
premiere of “Dreamgirls”. Ryan’s face is blank. It’s not
registering.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look, is this going anywhere, Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Ryan, he was Dad’s lover!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What? No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The guy in the leather jacket just showed me
pictures of him and Dad together.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, no, no. I don’t believe that. My father is
not gay. I’ve known him my whole life. And he’s the most non-gay man
I’ve ever met. Matter fact, he’s so straight he makes me seem gay. And I
know I’m not gay– Aaron pulls out the picture.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Uugg.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Uugg. I know.</p>
<p><strong>ryan/aaron</strong>: Uugg/Uugg. Aaron nods.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How can she be more interested in that idiot
than me? Women. They don’t know what they want! Norman’s still examining
his arm.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It sounds serious, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: A pigment mutation. Derek gives Norman a
disparaging look. Norman picks up some cake and takes a bite.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ooh, will you try this cake? I think it
might have nuts in it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: So?… Aaron’s uncle says I might be allergic
to nuts…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Then don’t eat nuts. Put the cake down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I can’t not eat the cake. That’s what I do
when I’m stressed. I eat cake.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I bet you won’t eat it when your arm falls
off. Norman sniffs the cake.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Will you just try it and tell me if there’s
nuts in it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Just do me a favor– Norman is pushing the
cake towards Derek’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get away from me. Derek gets up and walks
off, leaving Norman spitting out the cake. From under the table, Jeff
pops up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You haven’t seen a pill bottle around, have
you? A Valium pill bottle?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No. But can you try this– Jeff smiles
nervously and goes back to his search on the floor. Jeff slides across
the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the other end of the table. An
OLDER LADY turns to Russell.</p>
<p><strong>older lady</strong>: Edward and I watched the Tony Awards
every year. We would get all dressed up and sip cocktails. I’m going to
miss him so much.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Don’t worry. The way you look, you
won’t be far behind. The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his
search along the floor.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m sure we’ll start soon. He looks toward
the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to avoid him.</p>
<p>****: Let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: In a moment. Duncan gets up and heads
toward the house. He passes Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Doctor, I just have a– Duncan doesn’t stop,
leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman looks over and sees Cynthia. He
sits next to her.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m sorry… you know… about… you know…</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Thank you. I’ll be alright. I know he’s
watching over me.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You think so?’ I mean, there are a lot of
fine ones up in heaven. Anna Nicole Smith’s dead too, you know. might be
watching over her. Norman sits next to Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Death is a terrible thing… Did you check to
make sure he.was wearing shoes? I hear they steal the shoes. And I hope
you took off his ring, ’cause if it’s worth anything, someone is going
to take that, too. Cynthia stares at Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Before he died, did he have a rash? She gets
up and exits. Norman notices Jeff’s pill bottle on the ground. He picks
it up and puts it in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You don’t understand. If we don’t give him
the money, he’s going to show Mom the picture.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay. Let me think, let me think. Ryan is
trying to come up with a solution.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I think you should pay him the money.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What do you mean, you think I should pay him
the money? Where the hell is all your money?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m in debt up to my ass. I’m broke, man!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So after paying for the funeral, the clothes,
the catering… Now I’m supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars?
He’s your father, too.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You’re the oldest. Besides, you’ve been living
off Mom and Dad long enough. You must have some money saved. You haven’t
paid rent in two years.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I have not been living off of them… I’ve been
living with them.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No I haven’t paid rent, but Dad hasn’t worked
in five years. Who do you think has been paying all the bills?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well if you’ve got money problems and I’ve got
money problems, what can we do? Fuck him! Aaron shows Ryan the photo
again.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You’ve got to pay him.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yes, yes. Keep coming. Join the others. Join
the others.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar? She tries the door. It’s still
locked.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Os…</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: .car.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: No, my nephew is dead and these
bastards ate all the potato salad. Nearby mourners look appalled. The
reverend looks over and sees Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen
corridor. She approaches them.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Ah! I think we’re just about ready
to start the service, so-</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Would you mind giving us five minutes?</p>
<p>****: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thanks. Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He
passes Michelle, who’s sitting on the couch. She stands up.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No. I’m really sorry, honey, but buying a
condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What are you talking about? Why?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Babe, you know I wouldn’t do this unless I
had a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What’s the reason?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I haven’t got time right now, please. I’ll
explain later.</p>
<p><strong>but–</strong>: Aaron walks off to join Ryan, who’s at the
door of the study.</p>
<p>****: You? So you and my–. You?! It’s you. So when I called my father
and he didn’t answer, he was with you?! Aaron realizes what Frank is
reading.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Hey, hey, hey! Aaron rushes over and takes
the manuscript away from Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What are you doing with my manuscript?! It’s
not ready. He puts it in the desk.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, you left it on a coffee table.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, when you put things on coffee tables,
it’s assumed it’s for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It kind of is…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Can we get to the point here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fine by me. Aaron is now extremely irritated.
He exchanges a look with Ryan confirming that there’s no other way
out.</p>
<p>****: If I write this check, then that’s it. You give us the photos
and stay away from our mother. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Deal. Aaron sits down at the desk and
reluctantly takes out his check book. He starts writing.</p>
<p>****: Is it your first one? Aaron stops writing and looks up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The novel… it’s a first draft?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, nothing. Aaron continues to write the
check.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I tried writing once… Didn’t work for me,
either. I think it’s just a gift. You either have it or you don’t… It
must be hard for you though, especially since your younger brother is
such a great writer.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Your father and I read “Black Hurt” together.
Truly amazing. We loved it. He was so proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thanks… I guess… Aaron rips the check into
little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That’s it. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: There’s no way in the world I’m giving him my
hard earned money.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Don’t be stupid. Not today. I’ll pay you back
as soon as my money comes in.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He comes in today! Of all days, he picks the
day of my father’s funeral! Who the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He has the pictures!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So what. Who cares what he’s got. Let him
show the world. Put it on facebook. I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Let’s just get it over with. There’s a long
pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do. Finally, Frank stands
up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fine. This is on your head. Frank heads
towards the door.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What? No, wait.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ryan rushes to stand in front of the
door, blocking Frank’s</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Let’s just discuss this a minute.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s nothing to discuss. Frank grabs the
door and tries to open it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get out of my way. He tries to push past, but
Ryan covers his mouth, muffling his cries.</p>
<p>****: Get out of my way. Move! Ryan restrains Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Ryan, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get off me! Ryan is trying to muffle Frank’s
screams.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron, help me! Ryan is holding Frank down and
trying to keep him quiet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ah!!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron, you got any rope or duct tape?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?! I’m not a serial killer. I don’t keep
rope and duct tape in my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well just grab something! There, from the
curtains. Aaron grabs the cord that’s tied around the curtains. He holds
it over the wrestling duo, but Ryan’s hands are occupied with Frank.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Tie his legs. Aaron grabs his legs and in
doing so falls on top of Frank as well. As he wraps the curtain cord
around Frank’s legs…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: This is a really bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Men.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Tell me about it… How’s Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: How would I know? He’s been avoiding me
all day. We’re trying to get pregnant. But I can’t really do that by
myself, can I? I feel like I’m making him eat brussel sprouts every time
we do it. Elaine looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The guy’s father just died. Don’t you think
this is a bad day for sex?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Don’t you think I know that?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry. At least your husband didn’t ruin
the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s a funeral, it’s already ruined. When
you start off with a dead guest of honor, how much worse can it get?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Get that tie. Aaron grabs the necktie from off
the desk.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What am I supposed to do with the tie?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Whatever you do with a tie.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I don’t know what to–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just stuff it in his mouth! Damn, I have to do
everything?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Apparently everything but write a damn
check.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Suddenly the door opens and Norman
enters.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Aaron, do you know what was in this cake,
I-</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping
he’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Shut the goddamn door! Shocked, Norman does as
he’s told. It takes Norman a moment to register that Aaron and Ryan are
sitting on top of Frank. Frank continues screaming through the
cloth.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What is going on? Who is that guy? Ryan
thinks quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He’s having a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I just found some Valium outside. Would that
help?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah. Great. Give him some. Frank shakes his
head “no.” Norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s okay. This should help. calm you down.
Frank tries to protest, but can’t. Ryan holds Frank’s mouth open as
Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills into Frank’s
mouth, then Ryan holds Frank’s mouth shut. Suddenly the door opens again
and Jeff walks in.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying
around– They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time
he’ll get saved.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Norman! I told you to lock the damn door.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You said “shut the damn door.” Jeff locks
the door and looks shocked.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: He’s having a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why is he all tied up? No one knows what to
say.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s blackmailing you? Over what?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: If I could tell everybody, it wouldn’t be
blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look, just trust us. He’s the bad guy. We’ll
explain later.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What are you going to do with him?
Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him?
Ryan doesn’t have any answers.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You don’t know?! Come on, you’re the big
writer. You’re the one who came up with “Black Hurt.” Dream up something
where we all live happily ever after. We can’t keep him tied up forever.
How long do you think those Valium are going to last?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Valium?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yeah, I found that bottle of Valium. We gave
him a few to calm him down. Norman hands him the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ah shit! Jeff stands up and heads over to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: What? They all head over to Jeff. Frank looks extremely curious
to know what’s going on. Everyone talks very quietly so that Frank can’t
hear.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The thing is… those pills aren’t really
Valium. It’s acid and… acid.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oscar took one by mistake. That’s why he’s
acting crazy.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: A friend left them at my place.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What friend, Amy Winehouse?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Wait, you’re telling us that Elaine’s
boyfriend, who knocked over our father’s coffin, had just one of these
things…</p>
<p>****: And you gave him how many? Norman looks a bit guilty.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Five?! Poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I thought they were Valium. They all turn
and look at Frank who is looking back at them, increasingly concerned by
whatever conversation they are having, and the pitying expressions on
their faces.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Maybe we should call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You can’t do that. I’ll go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: He’s right. If anyone finds out this guy’s
been force fed acid, we could all be arrested.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So what then? What’s going to happen? Is he
going to die?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No… I don’t think so… I doubt it.. Probably
not…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The moment is broken by someone trying
the door, followed by a knock.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Are you in there? They look at each other
in panic.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Be out in a minute, Mom. Ryan looks at Norman
and Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay. We have to go out there. You two stay in
here and watch him. Ryan closes the curtains.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Watch him?! What do you mean, “watch
him”?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just make sure he doesn’t escape. Lock the
door behind us. We’ll deal with him after the funeral. Aaron and Ryan
open the study door leaving Norman and Jeff to take care of Frank.</p>
<p><strong>aaron .</strong>: How’s it going, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Reverend Davis wants to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Lookie here, brother. I’ve been
patient. We all know it’s a virtue, but I’m about done with patience.
Now if we don’t resume service soon, we’re going to need to have a
little conversation about my compensation.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Sure. So sorry. Um… can you just give us
another five minutes? The reverend doesn’t look too pleased.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Is everything okay, boys? Ryan and Aaron
kiss their mother and walk off.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why didn’t you just pay him the money?!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Why did you tie him up?!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Do you want Mom to find out?!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What is wrong with you? They start to
argue.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What’s your problem?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Women are my problem.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: No such thing as having a woman
without a problem. If they didn’t have problems, do you think they’d let
us touch ’em? Let me tell you something about women. Smarter than you
think they are. But not as smart as they think they are.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She acts like she doesn’t care that I exist.
I mean how can she not feel what I feel?</p>
<p>****: Oh she feels it. She’s playing hard to get. She wants you to
work for it. Look, let me tell something about women. They want a man
who can control them. I know they talk all this Oprah, Beyonce “single
women” BS, but what they really want is an old school man.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Listen here, boy. This is what you
do: you walk up to her, slap her–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Slap her? You want me to hit her?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Has not hitting her worked? Look,
then you grab her and kiss her. The harder the better.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you sure, ’cause that–</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where’s the
can? He rolls away quickly.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I can’t believe you gave him five. Even if
they were Valium, that’s too many. I wouldn’t give a guy five cough
drops. Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both look
terrified.</p>
<p>****: Hello? Jeff covers his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Hello?! Neither Norman nor Jeff want
to speak. They argue in gestures. Finally Jeff relents.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I need the toilet. Jeff and Norman
both look panicked. Norman goes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Can’t you use the one upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I’m in a wheelchair, you idiot! How
am I supposed to get up the stairs?!</p>
<p>****: Hello? Norman and Jeff look at each other not knowing what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Open the damn door! Uncle Russell
starts banging on the door with his cane.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What are we going to do? They look at Frank
who’s starting to look high as a kite.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We’ll stick him behind the couch.</p>
<p>****: Just looking for the key. They pick Frank up and dump him
behind the couch. Jeff stays with Frank to keep him quiet as Norman
opens the door. Uncle Russell wheels himself inside.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What the hell is wrong with you
people? I’m about to take a dump in my pants!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What do you want, Derek?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I just want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Please don’t make me go through this
again.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: The only reason you don’t want to go out with
me is because your dad likes me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No. The reason I don’t want to go out with
you is because it was a mistake. I was drunk off my ass. You could have
been a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That wasn’t a compliment. I’m saying I
couldn’t remember it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well I remember every minute of it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: A minute, huh? That’s why I don’t
remember.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What is it about this guy? What has he got
that I haven’t got?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Okay, well for one thing, he’s responsible.
He’s caring. He’s considerate. He’s thoughtful. He’s stable. He’s–</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m not the one who tied him up.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well somebody had to look out for Mom.</p>
<p>****: I’ve been looking out for Mom since you got your book deal.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You just can’t get over it, can you? You’re
burning with jealousy because I left and did what you always wanted to
do.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I couldn’t leave because I had
responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Don’t put it off on responsibilities. You
spent three years on a novel and you won’t even let anyone see it! What
are you going to do? Wait until you’re dead? You think you’re going to
be the Tupac of books?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: At least I’m not some hack writing crap.
Mr. “Mama’s Secret”, Mr. “Black Hurt.”</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Mr. “Out of Ink”, Mr. “Blank Page.” At least
my crap gets published. Michelle enters.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Aaron, what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Michelle, please, not now.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Why are you acting like this? Fine. We
don’t have to have sex today, but the condo? Don’t you want to get out
of here?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Just tell her, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Tell me what? Aaron closes the garage
door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Listen… Do you remember the guy in the
leather jacket?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well, I don’t know how to say this, but… it
looks like he and my father were having sex.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What? No. Not your father. With him?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No. Your father was the straightest guy I
know.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or
he’s going to show everyone photos of them doing… stuff…</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Stuff like what? Aaron and Ryan share a
look. Aaron shows Michelle the picture. She reacts.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Hurry up! Norman is struggling to
hold Uncle Russell up.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Have you got me?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yes, I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Come on, quick, quick, quick.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright, I’m trying to see where the toilet
is. He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Pants down. Pants down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No you do it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: How can I do it? I’m handicapped.
Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Drawers. Drawers. Take down my
drawers.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Who calls them “drawers”? Norman pulls them
down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s all down.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Am I there? Am I there? Norman looks
and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yes, yes. Just sit down. Uncle Russell sits
down on the toilet trapping Norman’s hand underneath and lets loose.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Ooh, that’s better. Norman pulls his
hand out and looks at it in shock.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Norman’s hand has shit on the fingers. He
starts freaking out and screaming.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ahh!!! Jeff goes into the bathroom to see
what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ahh!!!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ugh! Norman, panicking, rushes to the sink,
turns on the faucet full blast and sticks his hand under the water. This
causes a great splashing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Norman? Norman? Norman still has his face
down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Please, please. Just come off.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Norman! Norman turns and we see he has shit
splattered on his face.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What? Jeff points to his face.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You missed some. Norman turns slowly and looks
in the mirror. He freaks out.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, I think I’ve got some of it in my mouth!
Norman desperately rushes to wash it off.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Pull yourself together. Would you rather get
caught or have shit in your mouth?! Uncle Russell has fallen asleep on
the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, no. Check him. Check him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, man, you alright? No response.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Check him again. Check him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Man. Hey. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Wake him up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t know. Try Larry. Jeff looks at
Norman, but he doesn’t have a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Larry?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Shake him. Jeff bends down and shakes
him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Larry, wake up. It’s time to get up. From the
bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir. Norman quickly closes the
door.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Maybe it’s not Larry. Try something else.
Pinch him. Jeff pinches Frank. Still no response.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: He must be breathing. He has to be
breathing. Please God let him be breathing.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jeff looks concerned. He checks for a
pulse. He looks up at Norman with an expression that tells us all we
need to know.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: So that’s it? We’re just giving him all
the money we’ve saved?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well, it’s not that simple.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron refused to pay.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: How come you couldn’t pay, Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s not the point. Besides, the only reason
Aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his
novel.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Your novel? Michelle looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You let him read your novel? You wouldn’t
let me read your novel. Are you screwing him, too? ’Cause Lord knows
you’re not screwing me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ANGLE ON: Norman as he pastes a maniacal
grin on his face and crosses into the living room. As he moves through
the throng of mourners, they are all unnerved by him.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi. The
hugesmile never leaves his face.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman,
concerned. Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Norman, why are you grinning like that?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Can you come to the study for a second?
Aaron can see from Norman’s face, and the sweat on his forehead, that
something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia sitting in the
corner.</p>
<p>****: I’ll be back soon. Can you check on Mom?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Sure. They exit. Michelle crosses to
Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Hey, are you doing okay? It’s going to be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: If you’ve never given life, child, how can
you understand death?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s Aaron. Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan
and Aaron enter. Norman locks the door behind them. Aaron rushes over to
the body.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh shit! Call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s no point.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What do you mean “there’s no point”?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look at him! He’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Dead, dead?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Is there a “kind of” dead, Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What the hell did you do to him?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well he was alive when I left.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He hit his head on the table.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Oh no. This is really bad. This is really,
really bad.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Twenty-five to life. Norman looks at his
watch.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You know what, I really have to be</p>
<p><strong>someplace else–</strong>: Norman makes his way to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Look, I’m not the prison type. They’ll kill
me. Oh my God, I’m going to die. I’m going to die in prison. Oh my God,
do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison? Aaron smacks Norman.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Pull yourself together! Norman calms
down.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Thanks, man. After a beat, Ryan speaks.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look, no one here knows who this guy is.
Nobody knows his name. They probably didn’t even notice him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Didn’t notice him? He’s four fucking feet
tall.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Look, all we have to do is get rid of the
body. It’ll be like he came and left.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Get rid of the body?! It took me two months
to get rid of a couch.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did any of you happen to notice the size of
Uncle Edward’s coffin? Everyone looks at Jeff.</p>
<p>****: You want to bury him with my father?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why not?… I mean it’s not like he’s going to
know.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You have to admit, it makes sense, Aaron. The
coffin’s there, the hole in the ground’s there… He’ll be gone, finished,
end of story… Unless you have a better suggestion. Aaron desperately
tries to think of an alternative.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s funny. No matter what you say, I’m
convinced we’ll be together.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yeah, well, we all make mistakes… I used to
be convinced I was going to marry Prince. What happened there?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You still could.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m serious. You only live once. You might as
well do whatever it is that makes you happy.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes, but maybe I don’t think of life anymore
as all about me, me, me. Maybe I’ve discovered there’s something outside
of myself that I care about. And maybe you should, too. Derek looks
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s kind of cold. I care about you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, Derek, you care about you. You only care
about me in relation to how I affect you. There’s a difference.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s not true, Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Derek, get over yourself.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey! He slaps her on the butt. Elaine whirls
around. Derek grabs her on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m the man for you, and you’re coming home
with me. He kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What is that?! Elaine turns around.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! What are you doing? Get back here and
put your clothes on right now!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I saw you kissing him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I wasn’t kissing him. I swear. Please, baby,
put your clothes on. We’re at a funeral! Derek sticks his head out the
window behind Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: You cheater! You cheater! You’re committing
adultery!!!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m going to jump right now.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Remember you’ve got drugs in you. This isn’t
really happening. Oscar, look at me. She turns to Derek.</p>
<p>****: Get out of here! She pushes him back inside.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m going to jump. I’m jumping. You’re a
cheater!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: People gather. around and look up. We
only see Oscar from the waist up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’m going to jump. She’s cheating on me!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, please. Come back here.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There’s just no way we can do it. It’s
impossible. Suddenly there’s a knock on the door. Everyone freezes.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Norman, it’s Derek. Let me in. Everyone
freezes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh shit. Put him in the bathroom. Aaron and
Jeff drag Frank to the bathroom door.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you in there? Aaron opens the door and we
see Uncle Russell still on the toilet. He looks up.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What’s that? Aaron slams the door. We
can hear Russell’s muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom
door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Norman!! Why is Uncle Russell on the
toilet?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I forgot!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: How could you forget?! What the hell is wrong
with you?! Another loud bang on the door.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Aaron, open the door. Norman opens the door
as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from entering.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Aaron, where’s Norman?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s Oscar, he went crazy. He’s– Derek
realizes that something weird’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Nothing. Derek puts aside his curiosity for
the time being.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Look, Oscar’s on the roof stark naked. He saw
me kissing Elaine and now he’s threatening to jump!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ve got to go. Jeff rushes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I have to go out there. If he jumps, my sister
is going to kill me. Jeff rushes out.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Wait here. Aaron follows Jeff, but he does
not run. He walks out.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get back here. Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I believe I can fly! I believe I can touch
the sky!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aaron who steps out and sees everybody
watching Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, come inside. We’ll have some
coffee.</p>
<p>****: No! He climbs up on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar! She climbs out the window.</p>
<p><strong>gasps!</strong>: Aaron notices that everybody is captivated
by the drama.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine, what are you doing?! Elaine sees
Oscar climbing further up the roof.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine! Elaine follows Oscar. Aaron realizes
this is his chance. He heads back inside. Michelle catches him at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I think I can get rid of this guy, but I need
you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Okay. I’ll do what I can. She heads back
to the crowd on the lawn. As Aaron goes through the doorway of the
kitchen, Derek passes him on the way out to the lawn to see what’s
happening.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s Aaron! Norman opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Everyone’s out in the garden… We’ve gotta
move the body now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Let’s go! Ryan and Aaron grab Frank. As Norman
runs out.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Quick. Quick! Aaron and Ryan carry Frank out
as Norman looks around.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Make sure no one comes in. As they disappear
around the corner,, Norman closes the study door. He turns just in time
to find Reverend Davis approaching. He intercepts.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hi! The reverend looks around, not knowing
why Norman is being so especially friendly to her.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: So, what made you decide to get your God
on?</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, I really need to
use</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’d like to make a confession.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: I’m not a priest.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That’s okay, ’cause I’m not Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aaron, we have to do this. Aaron looks up at
Ryan and nods his assent. Ryan and Aaron lift up Frank and try their
best to put him in the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What do you think God’s favorite color
is?</p>
<p>****: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ll bet it’s blue. The sky’s blue. The seas
are blue. And the winds blew, too.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: We can’t leave it like that.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Ryan looks down and laughs.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: In a strange way, this might have been what he
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Be serious for a second. They begin lifting
him again.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why do you say I don’t take anything
seriously? You complain about me all the time, but if I didn’t play the
bad boy, you couldn’t play the martyr.</p>
<p>****: Aaron’s so great, Aaron’s so right, Aaron’s so responsible. Why
don’t you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while? It might make
you a better a writer.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Look, I must get to a phone. There’s
a man on the roof who’s going to jump.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m addicted to strip clubs. The shoes, the
poles, the smell. I just like to take my money and throw it in the air.
I like to make it rain.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar… Please don’t do this… love you.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Then why were you with him?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I wasn’t with him.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yes, you were! I saw you!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’ll never be good enough. Not for your dad,
and not for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oscar, please just come inside.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: No. You go inside.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Because you’re going to be a father. Oscar
looks at her, shocked.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m pregnant. We’re going to have a
child…</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Oscar and Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: You’re pregnant? Oscar is overcome with
emotion. Elaine holds out her hand.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I won’t be able to do it without you. Very
slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace. The crowd
applauds.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What about me?! I want a baby. Would
somebody get me pregnant?! Everybody looks at Michelle. She smiles
weakly.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Bye, Dad. Ryan takes a long look as he closes
the coffin.</p>
<p>****: We’re having a baby.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Great. Duncan heads toward the kitchen door.
He passes a shocked looking Derek. Michelle follows and speaks loudly as
Duncan is about to enter the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Aaron?! Oscar’s off the roof!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m going to kill him. Jeff follows Duncan
in, looks at the coffin, then looks at Aaron and Ryan questioning them
with his eyes. They return the look with silent assurance that the job
is done. Michelle comes in.</p>
<p>****: Hey, is he gone?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Thank God. Everybody breathes a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine! Elaine opens the bathroom door and
Duncan enters. Elaine helps Oscar get dressed.</p>
<p>****: Thank God you’re safe.</p>
<p>****: You idiot! What the hell is wrong with you? Stay away from my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Look, Dad–</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine, stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, I’m not staying out of this. Remember
how I told you we were moving in together? Well, I lied. We’re getting
married. Duncan is shocked.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’re what?!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: We’re getting married.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Elaine, you don’t have to marry him just
because you’re pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m not marrying him because I’m pregnant.
I’m marrying him because I love him.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: How can you love him? He’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Dad, this is my life. If you don’t like it,
too bad. But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you’d
better change your attitude, especially about my husband.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Bye, Dad. They exit.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Baby, I really think we should start again
now. Have you seen Uncle Russell? Aaron remembers where he is and looks
at Ryan. They rush off to the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his
pockets and realizes the pills are gone again. He goes off to find
them.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: What the hell is going on in this
place?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was
someone on the roof–</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Never mind that. What about that dead
body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What dead body?</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: Don’t mess with me. I know a dead
body when I see one. I live in a retirement home.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Did you hear that? She’s having a kid! Derek
looks at Norman who’s looking sort of distant.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How’s your skin thing?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh that… It’s probably nothing. I’m more
worried about Hepatitis C after having Uncle Russell’s shit in my mouth.
I think I’m feeling yellow. Norman touches his skin as he walks away,
leaving Derek confused.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Jeff frantically looking for the pill
bottle. He gives up and sits in a chair.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the
room as Aaron moves to his seat.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I’m telling you I saw the guy. He was
dead!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I know you did, Russell. We all did.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: No! In the bathroom. Ryan offers a
look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell’s a bit mad and
shouldn’t be listened to.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Michelle comes over to Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I can’t believe what a nightmare today has
been.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I don’t know. It’s been sort of exciting.
Aaron looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: For a funeral, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Listen, about the condo and the baby,</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: We’ll work it out. Let’s just get this day
over with. Then we can worry about the rest of our lives. Aaron hugs
Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I can’t believe I still have to do this
eulogy… with everything I’ve just found out. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It doesn’t change anything, does it?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Not a thing. Reverend Davis approaches Aaron,
looking at her watch and appearing flustered.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: We’re going to have to fly through
this now. I already missed a funeral and two Christenings.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Sure. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Do you want an open casket?</p>
<p><strong>aaron/ryan/norman/jeff</strong>: No! The reverend looks
shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She stands up at the front and
speaks quickly.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: Alright! Everybody in their seats
now! Hey, you, sit down. People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to
squeeze in next to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia
throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.</p>
<p><strong>reverend davis</strong>: I’d like to apologize on behalf of
the family for all of the distractions. I hope that everyone is settled
and ready to continue with the service. Aaron, the oldest son, would
like to say a few words about his father. Michelle gives Aaron an
encouraging look as he makes his way to the front. Aaron clears his
throat and prepares to begin. The room is absolutely silent. He takes a
deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry
up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: My father… was an exceptional–</p>
<p><strong>bang! bang! bang!</strong>: Suddenly, a loud banging emanates
from the coffin. Everyone stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks
over to Norman whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a
deer caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to
continue. He nervously struggles on.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: My father was an exceptional man.</p>
<p><strong>bang! bang! bang!</strong>: Everyone stares at the coffin in
awe. Aaron bravely continues.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Not only did he live for his family, but he
was always there for others–</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>mourner 1</strong>: There’s someone in there!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I knew it! I knew it! Suddenly the coffin lid
flips off and everyone stares in wonder as Frank sits up, looking like a
crazy person, and babbling incoherently. Several people scream. Frank
opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What the hell are you doing in my Dad’s
coffin? Frank starts grabbing at Edward’s body screaming.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Edward! Edward! Edward! Ryan, Norman and Jeff
try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but he’s holding onto the
corpse.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No! No! Finally they get Frank out and carry
him from the room. As he passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his
pocket at her feet. As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends
down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face
turns to horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is
broken by Cynthia’s furious cry. She drops the photos and runs at
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You bastard! Cynthia tackles Frank and
starts beating him.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He was with you! Duncan picks up the
photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell.</p>
<p><strong>uncle russell</strong>: I always thought he had a little
sugar in his tank. Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron
finally shouts across the room.</p>
<p><strong>my father was an exceptional man!!!</strong>: Everyone,
including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned. They all freeze.
There’s a long silence.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He had his… shortcomings, but he took care of
his family. He loved his family. He loved this house. He worked hard.
All I wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired
him. To give him the respect that he deserved… Is that really so much to
ask? We all get so distracted by the… little things in life. We forget
about the important things. Like the fact that we lost a great man. The
mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So maybe he loved “Dreamgirls” more than most
men. We don’t know why a man makes the choices he makes. But I do know
that my father made the best choices he could make. Life is complicated.
We’re just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and
confusion… and we do our best. And Dad did his best… Aaron looks over at
the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman,
Duncan as they are moved by Aaron’s words.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He taught us to go for what we wanted in
life, because you never know how long you’re going to be here… And
whether you succeed… or you fail… the important thing is that you
tried.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband
with pride. We see the various other mourners looking at Aaron and
listening.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: So when you all leave here today, I want you
to remember Dad for who he really was… A decent, loving man who never
condemned anyone for how they lived. Who never cast disparaging remarks
or held prejudices against race, gender… height. If only we could all be
as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father… Even dead, my
father has more character than everyone in this room. If I am half the
man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed. Aaron turns and
walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go. Michelle follows him out
of the room.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: How’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: She’s resting. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’ve asked Mom to come live with me for
awhile. It’ll give you and Michelle a chance to breathe a bit, you know.
Move and everything. Aaron looks at Ryan, surprised.</p>
