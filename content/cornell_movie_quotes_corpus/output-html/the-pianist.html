<h1 id="the-pianist">the-pianist</h1>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Mr. Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I came specially to meet you today. I love
your playing, but what a day to choose.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: My name’s Dorota, I’m Jurek’s sister. oh!
You’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jurek</strong>: C’mon, Dorota, you can write him a fan letter
later, this isn’t the best time, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Jurek, why have you been hiding her?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What you think, should I take Uncle Szymon’s
photograph?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Take it, don’t take it, take what you like.
Can’t you see I’m worried sick?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He’ll come home, he’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Mama, Wladek’s home.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Thank God - Wladek! You’re wounded.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s a little cut, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ve been worried sick.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: I told her not to worry. You had your papers
on you. If you’d been hit by a bomb, they’d have known where to take
you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Henryk, don’t say things like that, God
forbid, God forbid.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Papa, Wladek’s home.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: What’s it look like we’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: They bombed us, we’re off the air.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Warsaw’s not the only radio station.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Pack, darling, get your things, pack.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Out of Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Out of Warsaw. Where?</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: You haven’t heard?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Heard what?</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Haven’t you seen the paper? Where’s the
paper?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: I used it for packing.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: She used it for packing.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The government’s moved to Lublin.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: All able-bodied men must leave the city, go
across the river and set up a new line of defence, that’s what it
said.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: There’s hardly anybody left in this
building, only women, the men have gone.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: And what do you think you’ll do while
you’re setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your
suitcases?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Pack, Wladek, there’s no time.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Good! I’m not going anywhere either!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, we’ve got to keep
together.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: No, no, no, I’m staying put. If I’m going
to die, I prefer to die at home.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: God forbid!</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Sssh!</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Ssh! I’ve got something, listen…</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … an important announcement. News
has just been received through the BBC that Great Britain, having had no
reply… …and therefore has declared war on Nazi Germany… … next few
hours… awaiting latest news…</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: … but France is expected to make a
similar announcement… … Poland is no longer alone.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Mama, that was a great dinner.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It certainly was.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: When there’s something to celebrate, you’ve
got to make an effort.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Here’s to Great Britain and France.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I told you. Didn’t I tell you? All will be
well.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Five thousand and three.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes, five thousand and three zlotys, that’s
all we’ve got left.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: It’s three thousand and three zlotys too
much, ‘Re: Further restrictions regarding liquid assets: Jews will be
allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes.’</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What are we supposed to do with the
rest?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Banks? Who’d be stupid enough to deposit
money in a German bank?</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: We could hide the money here in the window
frame.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, no, no. I’ll tell you what we’ll do.
We’ll use tried and tested methods. You know what we did in the last
war? We made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: And suppose they take the table away?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What d’you mean, take the table away?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: The Germans go into Jewish homes and they
just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do they?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Idiot! What would they want with a
table?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What on earth are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: There’s a good place under the cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: No, no. Listen, I’ve been thinking –</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: That makes a change.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: You know what we do? We use psychology.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: We use what?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: We leave the money and the watch on the
table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search
high and low, I promise you, they’ll never notice it.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Of course they’ll notice it. But look–
This is a good place for something.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: A good place for what? He’s insane!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Just shut up.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: My violin?</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order!</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: She’s a lawyer, she likes order.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Listen, just listen. Let’s come to an
agreement. We jam the money in the window frame. The watch we hide under
the cupboard. And the chain we put in the violin.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Will I still be able to play?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>jurek</strong>: Wladek! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Fine, we’re fine, thank you, and you?</p>
<p><strong>jurek</strong>: Fine, we’re fine in the circumstances. But I
can guess what you’ve called about. There’s nothing we can do; they
won’t reopen the station–</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek…</p>
<p><strong>jurek</strong>: …not even music, nothing, no radios for the
Poles. But I’m sure you’ll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don’t be
offended, I didn’t call to discuss my future career.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at
last he gave in and said, ‘All right, come with me tomorrow,’ and so I
came and they bombed the station.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You know something? Meeting you like that
was absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes! It was…it was unforgettable.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I’ve always loved your playing,
Mr. Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Wladek, please.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: No one plays Chopin like you.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I could accompany you, me on the piano,
you on the cello.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Oh, Mr Szpilman, you’re quite… quite
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Wladek, please.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: ‘Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw
District. I hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw District will wear
visible emblems when out of doors. This decree will come into force on
the 1st December 1939 and applies to all Jews over twelve years of age.
The emblem will be worn on the right sleeve and will represent a blue
Star of David on a white background. The background must be sufficiently
large for the Star to measure eight centimetres from point to point. The
width of the arms of the Star must be one centimetre. Jews who do not
respect this decree will be severely punished. Governor of Warsaw
District, Dr. Fischer.’</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: I won’t wear it.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: won’t wear it. I’m not going to be
branded.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Let me see this.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Doesn’t it say we have to provide these
armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: We’re not going to get them. We’re not going
to wear them!</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: Why didn’t you bow?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’m sorry I…</p>
<p><strong>german officer</strong>: You are forbidden to walk on the
pavement. Walk in the gutter!</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Have you seen this?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What, I’m working, what?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman’s voice</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>halina’s voice</strong>: That’s where they’re going to put
us.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman’s voice</strong>: What d’you mean, put us?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: ‘By order of the Governor of the Warsaw
District, Dr. Fischer, concerning the establishment of the Jewish
District in Warsaw. There will be created a Jewish District in which all
Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside.” And look
here: ’Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to
the Jewish district by 31st of October 1940.’</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: But…they won’t get all of us… we’ll…it’s
too small…there’s four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so
it’ll be easy.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Mama, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Twenty zlotys. That’s all we’ve got left.
What can I buy with twenty zlotys? I’m sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>mr lipa</strong>: That’s the price. That’s what I’m offering.
And my advice is to accept. You won’t get more from anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: But…but it’s a Steinway, Mr Lipa…</p>
<p><strong>mr lipa</strong>: Two thousand. My advice is to take it. What
you going to do when you’re hungry? Eat the piano?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Get out! You’re a thieving bastard, we don’t
want your money, get out! We’d rather give it away! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>mr lipa</strong>: Hey! Hey! What’s the matter with you?
Haven’t you eaten today, what you suffering from? Hey!</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Henryk, stop it, leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>mr lipa</strong>: his breath,</p>
<p><strong>mr lipa</strong>: You haven’t eaten today, you’re crazy…</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Dorota!</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I didn’t want to come, I didn’t want to see
all this, but I couldn’t stop myself.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Fine, no, not really, they arrested my
cousin, but Jurek says they’ll let him out. This is disgraceful.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Don’t worry, it won’t last long.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: That’s what I said, it’s so - it’s too
absurd!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ll see you…soon.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: To tell you the truth, I thought it would be
worse.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: How will we sleep?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ll sleep with the girls in the kitchen.
You, Henrykc and Papa in here.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Look! Come and look!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You sell anything?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three
zlotys.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: That’s better than yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Three lousy zlotys. And there are people
here making millions.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: You don’t know, believe me. They bribe the
guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They’re bringing in cartloads,
food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all
around them and they don’t give a damn.</p>
<p><strong>the feather woman</strong>: Excuse me, but have you by any
chance seen my husband Izaak Szerman?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>the feather woman</strong>: A tall handsome man with a little
grey beard?</p>
<p><strong>the feather woman</strong>: No? Oh, do forgive me. Goodbye,
sleep well, if you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman’s his
name…</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Sometimes I wish I could go mad.</p>
<p><strong>the nervous man</strong>: This is totally insane; why do we
have to have a gentile street running through our area? Can’t they go
around?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Don’t worry about it, they’re about to build
a bridge, haven’t you heard?</p>
<p><strong>the nervous man</strong>: A bridge, a schmidge, and the
Germans claim to be intelligent. You know what I think? I think they’re
totally stupid. I’ve got a family to feed and I spend half my time here
waiting for them to let us through.</p>
<p><strong>the german soldier</strong>: Dance!</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: Faster! Go on, faster! Dance!</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: Dance! Dance!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Good, they’re here. Yitzchak Heller’s been
waiting for you, Henryk.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sit down, have tea, I’ll start lunch when
the girls get back.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: So, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He brought cakes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: His father’s back in the jewellery business
and doing well, isn’t that so, Yitzchak? Amazing. Jewellery.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: We’re recruiting.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Who’s recruiting?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Don’t be clever with me, Henryk. I’ve come
here as a friend. They’re bringing Jews in from all over the country.
Soon there’ll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more
Jewish police…</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me
to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the
Gestapo spirit. I see!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Someone’s got to do it, Henryk.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: But why me? I thought you only recruited
boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Yes, I’m looking at you and that’s why I’m
here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on
struggling for survival, selling books on the street?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: I’m doing you people a favour. And what
about you, Wladek? You’re a great pianist. And we’ve got an excellent
police jazz band. They’d welcome you with open arms. Join us. You’ve got
no work…</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Thank you. But I’ve got work.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Who wants me to stop?</p>
<p><strong>2nd child</strong>: Help me! help me!</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: I always say look on the bright side. You’re
in the small ghetto, intellectuals, professional people, you’re better
off than us. Here, in the large ghetto, it’s a cesspool. But you, you’re
living in Monte Carlo. You could say you’re privileged and that, of
course, goes against my principles. Nevertheless…</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Ah, here. Today’s news from the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You’re amazing, Jehuda.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: No, I’m a socialist. I have brothers
everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human
beings. Workers of the world unite.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: So, what’s the news?</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I don’t know why I come here every
evening, it’s always such bad news.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view,
Wladek, that’s your trouble. The news couldn’t be better. The moment
Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we’d be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same
business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Jehuda, give me something to do.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: You’re an artist, Wladek, you keep people’s
spirits up. You do enough.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: But I want to help, I want to.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: You’re too well known, Wladek. And you know
what? You musicians don’t make good conspirators. You’re too…too
musical.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: There are notices going up. The city’s to
be cleansed of undesirables.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: There are always notices going up.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind, Jehuda.
Working hard?</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in
Poland, maybe in the whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Meet Majorek.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: I know your name. I’ve never heard you
play.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Majorek used to be in the army. Brilliant
man. He’s got a mind like a searchlight. The only thing I’ve got against
him is he’s not a socialist. You’d better go now, Wladek. It’s nearly
curfew. You see these, Wladek? You know how many copies we print of our
newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Five hundred. You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty. That makes ten thousand readers. These
will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And
leaves them in toilets.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Toilets?</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: As many toilets as I can find. Germans
never go into Jewish toilets. They’re too clean for them.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And, please, tonight, for once, I don’t want
anything bad talked about. Let’s enjoy our meal.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Okay, then I’ll tell you something funny.
You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: The surgeon?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: The surgeon. Well, for some reason, don’t
ask me why, the Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an
operation…</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to come in to
operate on a Jew?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: He got a pass, that’s all I know. Anyway, he
puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation. He’d just made the
first incision when the SS burst in, shoot the patient lying on the
table, and then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there.
Isn’t that a laugh? The patient didn’t feel a thing, he was
anaesthetised -</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Henryk, I said nothing bad.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: What’s the matter with you all? Have you
lost your sense of humour?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Well, you know what’s funny? You’re funny
with that ridiculous tie.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What are you talking about, my tie? What’s
my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Boys, boys…</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Your work, yes, playing the piano for all
the parasites in the ghetto, they don’t give a damn about people’s
sufferings, they don’t even notice what’s going on around them!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I blame the Americans.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: For what? For my tie?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: American Jews, and there’s lots of them,
what have they done for us? What do they think they’re doing? People
here are dying, haven’t got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there
should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Be quiet, Mama, for God’s sake, be
quiet!</p>
<p><strong>a german voice</strong>: Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Oh my God, it’s terrible, you’ve got to do
something, oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Calm down, what, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: They’re hunting people on the streets.
They’ve picked up Henryk.</p>
<p><strong>the feather woman</strong>: Excuse me, but have you seen my
husband Izaak Szerman?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>the feather woman</strong>: He’s tall, he’s handsome. He has
a little grey beard. If you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman’s
his name, don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>the elderly man</strong>: They’ve got my grandson in there.
They pick ’em up, they take ’em away. What do they do to them? I’ve
stopped believing in God!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yitzchak!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yitzchak!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Here, please! Wladek Szpilman!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Henryk’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: I haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Believe me, they’ve picked him up.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Tough luck.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need
me!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Can you help us?</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: It costs.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ve no money.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Then there’s nothing I can do. He should’ve
joined us when I gave him the chance..</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yitzchak, they told me you had
influence.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: People I know. They said you’re an
important man.</p>
<p><strong>poor woman</strong>: A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher!</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein’s voice</strong>: Boys, keep your peckers up! And
girls, keep your legs crossed!</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Don’t let ’em get you down -</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Bandits! Crooks! Thieves!</p>
<p><strong>1st shupo</strong>: Good day, Herr Rubinstein.</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: If that means good day, I’m your man,
you gangsters, robbers, pirates!</p>
<p><strong>2nd shupo</strong>: Mad!</p>
<p><strong>rubinstein</strong>: Ich bin meshuge, you bandit!</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to
him?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You’re out, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of
shit, that cockroach?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I didn’t grovel, I asked him to help.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: What did you pay him?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Pay him? With what? With what could I pay
him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: I can look after myself!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: They were taking you away.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: It’s nothing to do with you. It’s me they
wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people’s business?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You’re mad, that’s your trouble, you’re
mad.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: That’s also my business.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s the matter? Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Hungry.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s that mean, no employment
certificate?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: You have to have an employment certificate
to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Otherwise what?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: You’ll be deported.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: So the rumours were true…</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: They’re going to resettle us. Send us to
labour camps. In the east. And they’re closing the small ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Wladek!</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: I thought you’d be off on tour, playing
London, Paris, New York?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Not this week.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: I have to say you look terrible. What’s the
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You’ve heard the rumours they’re going to
resettle us in the East?</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much
to heart, Wladek.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ve been trying to get a certificate of
employment for my father. I’ve managed to get certificates for me and
the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I’ve been
trying all the firms, the shops…</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Why didn’t you come to me?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I didn’t know you were in the certificate
business.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: I’m not, but Majorek is.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Can you help? I’ve no money…</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: Please, don’t insult us. Can you do
something for him?</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: Be at the Schultz Workshop, tomorrow, four
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jehuda</strong>: You see what a wonderful piece of luck
you’ve had today? That’s die historical imperative in action and that’s
why I always say, look on…</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: …the bright side, yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: My pleasure. It won’t help you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: At least we’ve got work in the ghetto. At
least we’re still together.</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: Out! Assemble in the yard!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: We’re employed here, we’ve got
certificates -</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: The rest of you get dressed then report back
here. Bring your belongings. Fifteen kilos only.</p>
<p><strong>a young woman</strong>: Where are you taking us?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m sorry, I did my best, I thought the
certificates would save us all.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Stop it, Wladek.</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Let’s just hope that Henryk and Halina will
be better off -</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Where will we be going?</p>
<p><strong>jewish policeman #1</strong>: You’re going to work. You’ll be
much better off than in this stinking ghetto. The gates are</p>
<p><strong>jewish policeman #2</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Let’s sit over there.</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Why did I do it? Why did I do
it?</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Why did I do it? Why did I do
it?</p>
<p><strong>woman with child</strong>: He’s dying, don’t you have a drop
of water? My child’s dying of thirst, he’s dying, he’s dying, I beg
you!</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: I’m telling you, it’s a disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ehrlich</strong>: We’re letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Dr. Ehrlich, not so loud!</p>
<p><strong>dr. ehrlich</strong>: Why don’t we attack them? There’s half
a million of us, we could break out of the ghetto. At least we could die
honourably, not as a stain on the face of history!</p>
<p><strong>grun</strong>: Why you so sure they’re sending us to our
death?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ehrlich</strong>: I’m not sure. You know why I’m not
sure? Because they didn’t tell me. But I’m telling you they plan to wipe
us all out!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me to do? You
want me to fight?</p>
<p><strong>grun</strong>: To fight you need organisation, plans,
guns!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He’s right. What d’you think I can do? Fight
them with my violin bow?</p>
<p><strong>grun</strong>: The Germans would never squander a huge labour
force like this. They’re sending us to a labour camp.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ehrlich</strong>: Oh, sure. Look at that cripple, look at
those old people, the children, they’re going to work? Look at Mr
Szpilman here, he’s going to carry iron girders on his back?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Henryk!</p>
<p><strong>regina</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Halina! Henryk!</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: We heard you were here…we…didn’t want…we…we
wanted to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: almost to himself,</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Why did I do it? Why did I do
it?</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Why did I do it? Why did I do
it?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: She’s getting on my nerves. What did she do,
for God’s sake?</p>
<p><strong>grun</strong>: She smothered her baby.</p>
<p><strong>grun</strong>: They’d prepared a hiding place and so, of
course, they went there. But the baby cried just as the police came. She
smothered the cries with her hands. The baby died. A policeman heard the
death rattle. He found where they were hiding.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: ‘If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you
tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you
wrong us, shall we not revenge?’</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Very appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: back and resuming</p>
<p><strong>henryk</strong>: Idiot. What’s he think he’s going to do with
the money?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How much for a caramel?</p>
<p><strong>the sweet boy</strong>: Twenty zlotys.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What? For one caramel? What d’you think
you’re going to do with the money?</p>
<p><strong>the sweet boy</strong>: Twenty zlotys.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Have we got twenty between us?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Halina?</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Funny time to say this.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: wish I knew you better.</p>
<p><strong>halina</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Szpilman! Szpilman!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Papa!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Papa! Mama! Halina!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, Szpilman?
I’ve saved your life! Now, go on, save yourself!</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Don’t run!</p>
<p><strong>jewish policeman</strong>: Well, off they go for
meltdown!</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s like this… I…we…all of them.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: Perhaps they’re lucky. The quicker the
better. It isn’t over yet. We’ll stay here for a couple of days. Until
things die down. I’ve bribed a policeman. He’ll come when it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: My God. I haven’t been outside for - it
must be two years.</p>
<p><strong>fellow worker</strong>: Don’t get over-excited.</p>
<p><strong>dealers</strong>: Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles!</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Look - oh, do look!</p>
<p><strong>the young woman</strong>: Jews!</p>
<p><strong>the young man</strong>: Can’t be the first time you’ve ever
seen Jews.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: Someone you know?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: A beauty. Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: A singer. Her husband’s an actor. I knew
them well. Good people. I’d like to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>benek</strong>: Don’t forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for
helping Jews.</p>
<p><strong>young ss man</strong>: Halt!</p>
<p><strong>young ss man</strong>: Lie down!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: Since last night. I was pleased to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: They’re going to start the final
resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A
good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to
Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch
leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people
from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of
food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach
the Treblinka station. They’re exterminating us. Won’t take them long.
We’re sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people.
And this time we’re going to fight. We’re in good shape. We’re
organised. We’re prepared.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: If you need help…</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: hissing through</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Get him away from here.</p>
<p><strong>bartczak</strong>: Hope you played the piano better than you
carry bricks.</p>
<p><strong>polish workman</strong>: He won’t last long if he goes on
like this.</p>
<p><strong>bartczak</strong>: I’ll see if I can get him something
better.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Trouble.</p>
<p><strong>a german voice</strong>: Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working! Only the Jews! Poles go on working!</p>
<p><strong>ss captain</strong>: I have important and good news for you.
There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going
to be taken.</p>
<p><strong>ss captain</strong>: I want to assure you personally that no
such measures will be taken now or in the future. Posters will be going
up also to this effect. As proof of our good will, we want you to select
a delegate, who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy, on
each worker’s behalf, five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread,
which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto. Now, why would
we do that j if we meant to resettle you?</p>
<p><strong>ss captain</strong>: You can do good business on what you
don’t eat. Isn’t that what you Jews are best at? Making ‘geld’?</p>
<p><strong>ss captain</strong>: Carry on.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: The smaller one. At the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Majorek!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: It’s easy to get out, it’s how you survive
on the other side that’s hard.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I know. But last summer, I worked for a
day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her
husband’s an actor. They’re old friends. I’ve written their names down.
And their address. If they’re still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you
try and make contact? Ask them if they’d help me get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant</strong>: Any fucking plaster?</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant’s voice</strong>: the plaster to his</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant’s voice</strong>: What the fuck are those?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: We’re allowed to take food into the
ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes and a…</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s only potatoes and bread.</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant</strong>: Fuck that, you’re lying, I can smell
it. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant</strong>: You’re all the same. Give a Jew a
little finger, he takes the whole hand.</p>
<p><strong>ss lieutenant</strong>: You lie to me again and I’ll shoot
you personally.</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: I tried your friends. They’re not at that
address any more. But.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You made contact?</p>
<p><strong>majorek</strong>: Be ready to leave in two days’ time. Same
place as last night.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Und-zick! Und-zack!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: I’ll soon teach you discipline! Jew
pigs!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Know why we beat you?</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Know why we beat you?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: To celebrate New Year’s Eve!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: Now, march! Go on, march!</p>
<p><strong>zick-zack</strong>: And sing! Sing something cheerful! And
sing it good and loud!</p>
<p><strong>all workers</strong>: Hey, ranks unite And follow the White
Eagle! Stand up and fight Our mortal enemy. Riflemen, hey! Let’s give
them fire and brimstone. We’ll blow away The yoke of slavery. Punish and
rout The rapists of our nation. We’ll smash the knout To save our
dignity. Soon we’ll be proud Of our liberation -</p>
<p><strong>german voices</strong>: Get on with it and fall in! Fall
in!</p>
<p><strong>bogucki</strong>: We haven’t much time.</p>
<p><strong>bogucki</strong>: You must hurry.</p>
<p><strong>bogucki</strong>: We’re going to have to keep moving you. The
Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now. Jews, non- Jews, anybody,
everybody. See if these fit. And, Wladek, you’d better shave. Use my
razor. In the cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Thank you, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bogucki</strong>: You’ll be looked after by Mr Gebczynski.
He’s on the other side of town. You’ll stay there tonight. Then we’ll
find you somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: I’ll bring you food.</p>
<p><strong>bogucki</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: I’ll show you where you’re going to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: It’s not going to be very
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: You’ll have to stay here until tomorrow
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: We’ve got a flat for you. Near the
ghetto wall. But it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: Go as near to the front as possible, to
the German section.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: Must feel better this side of the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes, but sometimes I’m still not sure
which side of the wall I’m on.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: I’ll come again. And Janina Bogucki will
visit twice a week. Bring more food. See how you are.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: Yes, now, this is very important. In
case of emergency, I mean emergency, go to this address.</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Puppydog, what d’you mean, you
forgot?</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: What d’you think I mean, Kitten? I
forgot, that’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: You know what? You treat me like
dirt!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: I treat you like dirt because you
are dirt.</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Pig!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: Cow!</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Pig!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Dirty pig!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: You’re a dirty pig!</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Takes one to know one! Pig!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: You play like an angel,
Kitten.</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: If I play like an angel, why don’t
you listen?</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: I was listening, Kitten.</p>
<p><strong>kitten’s voice</strong>: Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!</p>
<p><strong>puppydog’s voice</strong>: Kitten, let me in.</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: wanted to come earlier but…</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: No one thought they’d hold out so long.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: should never have come out. I should’ve
stayed there, fought with them.</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: Wladek, stop that. It’s over now. Just be
proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes, so did the Germans.</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: They’re in shock. They didn’t expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who’d have thought?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Yes, but what good did it do?</p>
<p><strong>janina</strong>: What good? Wladek, I’m surprised at you.
They died with dignity, that’s what good it did. And you know something
else? Now the Poles will rise. We’re ready. We’ll fight, too. You’ll
see.</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: Get your things together, you have to
leave!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: I’m on the run!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: The Gestapo found our weapons. They’ve
arrested Janina and Andrzej. They’re bound to find out about this place,
too - you must get away at once.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Where do you want me to go? Look at me.
No, no, I’m not leaving. Can’t I take my chances here?</p>
<p><strong>gebczynski</strong>: That’s your decision. But when they
storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don’t let them get
you alive. I have poison on me, they won’t get me alive either!</p>
<p><strong>kitty’s voice</strong>: Open this door at once, or we’ll call
the police!</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Are you from the flat in there? You’re not
registered.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It belongs to a friend of mine. I came to
visit but I must have just missed him.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Have you got your identity card? Let me see
your identity card!</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I want to see your identity card!</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: He’s a Jew! He’s a Jew! Stop the Jew! Don’t
let him out!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Mr Gebczynski sent me.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Wladyslaw Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Dorota.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Come in! come in!</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m sorry - I was given this address. I’m
looking for a Mr– – a Mr Dzikiewicz.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Michal Dzikiewicz. He’s my husband.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I need help.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: He’ll be back before curfew.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ve been in hiding. I need somewhere to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: He’ll be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Just over a year.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: And how’s Yurek?</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: When’s your baby due?</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Christmas. This is not a good time to have
children. But then…</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Marek Gebczynski sent him.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: Oh, yes. I remember.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Mr Gebczynski said to contact you only in
an emergency, but…</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: Don’t worry now. We can’t move you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: You’ll sleep on the sofa.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Excuse me, could I have a piece of
bread?</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: Yes, of course, we’ll eat.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: You’re in a very German area. The building
opposite is a hospital, taking in wounded from the Russian front. Next
door is the Schutzpolizei. It’s the safest place to be. Right in the
centre of the lion’s den.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: I’ll be locking you in. No one knows you’re
here. So keep as quiet as possible.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: All well?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: This is Antek Szalas.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: He’s going to look after you. I’ve given him
a second key. He’ll bring you food. See that you’re all right. He’s with
the underground, a good man.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: You don’t remember me, Mr. Szpilman?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: No, I don’t think so?</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you
almost every day.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Sorry, I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: Doesn’t matter. You’ve nothing to worry
about. I’ll visit often.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: And you’ll be pleased to hear the Allies are
bombing Germany night after night - Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: And the Russians are really giving them
hell. It’s the beginning of the end.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: Let’s hope so. I don’t know when I’ll see
you again?</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: Still alive then, are you? Here. Sausage.
Bread.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: How long is this meant to last?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: think I’ve got jaundice.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: You don’t want to worry about that. My
grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. In my
opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Why didn’t you come sooner? It’s been over
two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: Problems. Money. I’ve got to raise money to
buy the food. I need things to sell, it’ s not easy.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Sell this. Food’s more important than
time.</p>
<p><strong>szalas</strong>: Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The Allies
have landed in France. The Russians’ll be here soon. They’ll beat the
shit out of the Germans. Any day now.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Wladek? Wladek! I knew it, I knew this would
happen!</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I’m going to get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: You can’t, it’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: I’ll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: Dorota, don’t be ridiculous, he’s a
pediatrician.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: He’s still a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michal</strong>: No, you stay, I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: We came to say goodbye. We’re going to stay
with my mother in Otwock.The baby’s already there. It’s safer. There’s
talk that the uprising will begin any day now.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: That man Szalas should be shot. He’s been
collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently, people gave
generously. So he collected a tidy sum. He told us he was visiting you
daily.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Acute inflammation of the gall bladder.
Liver the size of a football. But he’ll live. I’ll try to get hold of
some levulose, but it’s not easy.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Can you visit him again?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Doctor, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Don’t speak. Rest.</p>
<p><strong>dorota</strong>: Michal brought food. I’ll prepare something
now for you, then we must go.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Where? Where? Just get out! Everywhere! Get
out into the street!</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: Get out now! The Germans have
surrounded the building! They’re going to blow us to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>the man’s voice</strong>: Everyone out, please! Leave your
flats at once, please!</p>
<p><strong>german voice</strong>: Fourth floor, Fischke!</p>
<p><strong>german voice</strong>: At the double, Fischke!</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I was… I was trying to open this tin.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: What’s your work?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I am… I was a pianist.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: A pianist.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Play.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Are you hiding here?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Jew?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Where are you hiding?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: In the attic.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Have you anything to eat?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: I’ll bring you something.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Open up.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s all that gunfire?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: The Russians. On the other side
of the river. All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Come down.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: We’re getting out.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Are the Russians here?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I don’t know how to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Don’t thank me. Thank God. It’s
His will that we should survive. Well. That’s what we have to
believe.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: I’ve got another one. Warmer.
What will you do when it’s all over?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’ll play the piano again. On Polish
radio.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Tell me your name. I’ll listen
out for you.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Szpilman. Good name for a
pianist.</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker voice</strong>: …German army! Polish soil
liberated! Official!</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: German! German!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Stop, for God’s sake, I beg you, I’m
Polish!</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Don’t shoot! I’m Polish!</p>
<p><strong>1st polish officer</strong>: He’s Polish!</p>
<p><strong>2nd polish officer</strong>: Come out with your hands up.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: Don’t shoot! I’m Polish! Please, please!
I’m Polish!</p>
<p><strong>1st polish officer</strong>: Yes, he’s Polish!</p>
<p><strong>2nd polish officer</strong>: Why the fucking coat?</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>2nd polish officer</strong>: Take him to headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Look at them - bastards!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: German fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: I prayed for this, never thought I’d see
it.</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: Murderers! Assassins! Look at you now! You
took everything I had! Me, a musician! You took my violin! You took my
soul!</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: Do you happen to know another
musician, a Mr Szpilman? A pianist! Polish radio?</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.</p>
<p><strong>the german captain</strong>: I helped Mr Szpilman when he was
in hiding. Tell him I’m here. Ask him to help me…</p>
<p><strong>russian guard</strong>: Hey! No talking to the prisoners. Get
away from there!</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: It was here, I’m certain of it.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: It’s not here now.</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: I shouted abuse at them, I’m not proud of
it, but that’s what I did, and, I’m certain, I stood where you are now.
There was barbed wire, and this German came up to me.</p>
<p><strong>szpilman</strong>: You didn’t catch his name.</p>
<p><strong>lednicki</strong>: No. I’ll ask at the factory. They may know
something.</p>
