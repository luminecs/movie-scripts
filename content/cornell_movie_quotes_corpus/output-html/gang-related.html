<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 325 a
month. Utilities included. That’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: But I gotta get at least a forty footer.
It’ll handle rough water better and I’ll need the room if I’m gonna live
on it.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I don’t know how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: How you can think about Hawaii now?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: My heart’s in Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You never been there. How can your heart
be there.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You’re tellin’ me there’s no place you’d
rather be other than here?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No, I’m saying I just don’t know how you
can think about Hawaii right now.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn’t be
thinking about here. See the difference?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Look, I’m not in Hawaii, I’m here. But I
don’t want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can’t be in Hawaii,
therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being
here.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: But I’m here, I know I’m here, I don’t
like being here, but I can’t be anyplace else because I look around and
I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That’s what I’m
asking.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Focus.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Focus.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: It’s time. No more Hawaii, okay? Focus on
this.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Aloha.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Aloha my ass.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Left at the corner.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hope you don’t mind me checkin’ you for
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Hell yes I mind.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: I just don’t want no man handlin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Okay. Check him.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Lotta good hidin’ places on this body. Check
good.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Careful. It’s loaded.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He’s got nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Not bad, not bad. Any more where this came
from?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Then maybe we talk again.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Told you there was a lotta good hidin’ places
on this body.</p>
<p><strong>hudd</strong>: Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin’ places,
too.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Come on! Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street
before you get run over. Joe, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You’re in the street, Joe. Get outa the
street.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Other way, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Forget it, Joe. Maybe you’re better off
right there. I don’t think you’d even feel it.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Got your money.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Put it on the table.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Take a sleeping pill. There’s some in my
purse.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You want your money?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I already worked for that.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is a bonus.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: For who?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This ain’t my fault. This is a failure of
our educational system. If you hadn’t fallen through the cracks and
dropped outa school, you wouldn’t be here now.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: So what’s your excuse?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Keepin’ some late hours.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What the hell you doin’? What’re my
neighbors gonna think?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: I apologize. I understand your concerns. But
you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as
sufficient encouragement to repay one’s debts. I am forced to employ the
likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes
significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am
concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand,
nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due.
What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I can make your life fuckin’ miserable
that’s what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do
I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan
money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can’t
control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced
to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The
point of which is, I already have a fuckin’ miserable life. So don’t
threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: All I’m askin’ is that you be responsible. Is
that unreasonable?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Four thousand is all I got.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: I am proportionally reassured. You purchased
yourself an extension.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin’
idiot name is that?</p>
<p><strong>cutless supreme</strong>: It was the car my daddy stole to
take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him
dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back
seat.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman mahoney</strong>: Another day, another body. Where
you wanna start?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: A hit?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman mahoney</strong>: Looks like. Could be gang
related.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman mahoney</strong>: Happened sometime last night,
early morning, two, three o’clock. African- American male, looks like in
his thirties. But even that’s a guess. Half his head is on the
upholstery.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Any witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman mahoney</strong>: Oh, sure, hundreds.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Fuckin’ Animals.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: …three shotgun shells, twelve
gauge.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Three shotgun shells, twelve
gauge.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: Heard you got a gang related.
Lucky guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty ones.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: One less drug store on the street.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: And the world is a safer place.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: – a green car… you know what make… Maybe
a Ford, uh-huh. You didn’t see the license, did you?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark…
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Wanna go for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You think you could describe the driver?
You bought it?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: As of last night, I’ve got the down. Just
picture me under swayin’ palms with a Mai Tai.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Uh-huh. You’re gonna buy it, no shit.
When?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just a phone call away.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: That’s really great, man.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Uh-huh, okay… how tall was he?</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: You got primary on the drug related
this morning on 27th.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m workin’ it up now.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: Who’s your second? In my office.
Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez,
this is Richard Simms. He’s with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some
questions about your case.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’s the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: You get an i.d. on the victim?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We’re waitin’ for prints.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Car was registered to –</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: – Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. Black.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If you got all this, what d’you want from
us?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: …The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: How d’you know that? What’s goin’ on
here?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Hudd was DEA, undercover.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: He was workin’ a case on syndicate
distribution of drugs on the south side. But every dealer we tagged kept
getting killed. He finally got a lead on a girl – Hudd was a friend of
mine… I’m gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We’ll do everything we can to help.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Calm down!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Shut up and listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: They could be watchin’ us right now you
asshole. So fuckin’ shape up! You got it?! I want you to nod!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Get the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: There’s no fuckin’ reason to panic.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No fuckin’ reason to panic? Did you say
no fuckin’ reason to panic!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Stop being an idiot! We’re the cops on the
case. It’s our case. We are going to find the fuckin’ killers.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Since when does that matter?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: All they want is someone to go down for the
crime, right? Do we care who goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As long
as someone goes down for the crime. It’s a slot that’s gotta be
filled.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We killed a cop, doesn’t that bother
you?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Of course it bothers me. What d’you want me
to do, turn myself in? Well I’m not. That’s the risk we take everyday,
somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. So he got
popped. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Not by other cops!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I patted him down! He wasn’t wearin’ a
wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was I supposed to know?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Look, I feel just as bad as you do, but we
gotta start thinkin’ about us here. The important thing is we don’t lose
control of the case. We can never lose control of the case. Whatever
evidence there is goes through us. We lay down the trail. Make it nice
and logical. We’re the teachers and two and two can add up to five if
it’s our classroom.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about, are you sayin’
we stick somebody with this?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Evidence points wherever we want it to
point. Shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick
will think he fuckin’ killed him.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You got some asshole in mind?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just don’t worry. We’ll find a killer.
There’s lots of ’em out there.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What the hell’d I do now?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Ain’t my gun.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Never is, is it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: That ain’t my fuckin’ gun.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Got your fuckin’ prints on it.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Where were you Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Friday night… last Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Whatever you think I did went down last
Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Better have a good alibi, James, or it’s
good ali bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I was in jail you assholes. Check it out. All
night. What a couple a dickheads!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Ain’t my gun.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Got your prints on it.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: You fuck, I ain’t never seen that gun
before!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Where were you last Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Lawyer’s not gonna help you, Cortez. All
the evidence we got points right to you.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Did you say last Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin’ gutter
shits. And Thursday night, and Saturday, too. I just fucking got out
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Alright, alright, alright… shit. I ain’t gonna
fight you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Ain’t my gun.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: That’s what they all say.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty and Wes
.44 mag with serial numbers filed off. Got any bullets?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Who did I kill?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Where were you last Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You mean, what’s my alibi right?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I was breakin’ and entering. Jewelry store on
seventh and Front, about nine o’clock. Not even close to your
jurisdiction. I got the rocks to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sorry I can’t help ya. But one to five is
better than ten to life.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Montrose LaJolla…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We pulled him in last year for knifing
that dealer on 32nd.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah. Almost killed him, remember? He’d be
good.</p>
<p>****: Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?</p>
<p><strong>another detective</strong>: He’s dead. His life partner
killed him in a Domestic D about a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: This isn’t gonna work!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Nobody said it was gonna be easy. But let’s
not advertise our despair… Okay?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Divinci.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is our case! Not the goddamn
DEA’s!</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: It’s been three days.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We’re not fuckin’ magicians! What the hell
is three days?! This is a goddamn murder case! It takes a little bit of
goddamn time!</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: When a Federal Undercover Officer
goes down, it’s never a fuckin’ murder case! I don’t like the DEA on my
ass any better than you like ’em on yours. But this is personal for them
and they want answers. Forget your other cases and get something,
anything that I can give to them. The last thing I want is the goddamn
F.B.I. on my back, too.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We’ve got a couple leads. We need a little
more time.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: I can’t hold ’em off much
longer.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: This is no fuckin’ way to run an
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: Let me tell you both something, if
you don’t solve this quick, they’re gonna start askin’ why? And they’ll
be lookin’ to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is,
get something fuckin’ fast or turn over what you’ve got and get outa the
way.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: How much time we got?</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: A couple days. The funeral’s this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What funeral?</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you
there.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What for? We didn’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: How the hell do I know?! It’s DEA,
it’s their thing. You’re the cops on the case, I suppose they want you
to know what a great guy Hudd was so you’ll work all that harder to find
his killer. Just go. It’ll reassure ’em how much you care and keep ’em
off my ass.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: – and it is too easy to say that he was a
good man in his job because he gave more than most. And it’s too easy to
say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than
others. And it’s too easy to say he was a good man at home with his
family because he was always there when they needed him. Special Agent
Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man. And
his death shall not be in vain.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Don’t Humpty Dumpty on me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Your cracks are startin’ to show.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Get your balance. Here comes the King.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Glad you came… Anything break?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Nothin’ to brag about. But we’ve got a
couple new leads we’re followin’.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: …Look, normally we’d be all over this, but
your Captain seems to think you can do the job. It’s your territory. I
guess you know it better than anybody. And that can be worth a lot. But
you understand… we won’t wait forever.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just outa curiosity… What happened to his
backup? You guys use backup on undercover don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid backup
would blow his cover. He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the
deal went down. He never checked in.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We want this one as bad as you do. A
cop’s a cop. We’re in this together, right?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: That’s why I asked you to come here. Just so
you knew that.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He didn’t have backup. You believe that?!
Jesus what a dick.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I don’t think we should criticize that
particular decision of his.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I don’t care what the reasons are, you
don’t play Lone Fuckin’ Ranger on a drug buy. You’re just askin’ for it.
That’s all I’m sayin’.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I don’t trust those bastards. They’re not
waitin’ for us. That’s bullshit. They’re runnin’ their own
investigation. I know it!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Let ’em. The gun, the coke came from
evidence. The car came from impound. So what’s to find?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: That’s what I’m afraid of. There’s
nothing for them to find. We were too good.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: So what’re you worried about?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Nobody is that fuckin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Except us.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I think this is breaking and entering,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I work homicide, I don’t deal with that
shit.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Learn anything you didn’t already have on
file?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I
think you’re just a hard case and I discover you’ve got a heart of gold.
You’re an organ donor. That’s really nice. The only problem is, they’ll
never use your best parts.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’ll make sure you get them.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, don’t get me wrong. I was just
surprised that we had something in common… Besides what we have in
common.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Do everybody a favor, if you’re gonna
donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one
that beats.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Cynthia… pretty name. What do the first
three letters spell?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Don’t get so clever. It’s out of
character.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What’s so interesting up there?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Then why’s it got all your attention?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m thinkin’, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: About us?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What if I was thinkin’ about us?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Don’t waste your time.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What if I was?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Where’s it gonna get us?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Maybe I got plans.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t wanna hear ‘em. Plans just make you
think somethin’s gonna get better. I’m fine now. I don’t need to get
screwed up waitin’ for something good to happen.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I just want you to know, love is important
to me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: But more important is loyalty. Nothing is
more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is
about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect
it’s empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect.
And once it’s gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to
you. Like I’m loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust
him with my life.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Why’re you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: When you asked if I was thinkin’ about us
and I said I wasn’t, I just want you to know that I do.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Just don’t ask me to marry you.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Why aren’t more women like you?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You fuckin’ idiot.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’ve we got here?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Where were you last Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Your name, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …Joe…</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Where’d you get the gun, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat
pocket. You must keep it for protection, right?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs
protection. Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don’t
have to worry about me, I’m not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at
something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is where it happened, Joe. I want you
to remember it. This is where you killed him</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You remember it now? How you shot him
through the head? You remember it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I… don’t…</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Who the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Is that any way to answer the phone?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Divinci, shit! It’s quarter to six.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I know what time it is, I’m not the one in
bed. I need the photos of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I got a suspect. But he can’t remember all
the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you’re my
partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin’
hand.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: He doesn’t remember last Friday?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He doesn’t remember a lotta Fridays. Bring
the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka. Make it two.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Time to get up, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I want you to look at something.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: There’s the guy and the street and the car.
You remember how you shot him.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You don’t remember? That’s not what you
told me last night.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If you remember you can have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: But you gotta remember how you saw him
driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was
going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember
now don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: And where’s your gun, Joe, where do you
keep your gun?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Why’d you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I… don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: It was your gun.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I don’t have a gun.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yes you do. In your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I know, Joe, it’s tough to remember things
you don’t wanna remember. What about your last name, Joe. You got a last
name?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Come on, Joe, everybody’s got a last
name.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Don’t fuck with us, Joe. We’re trying to
help you. What’s your last goddamn name?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Come on, we’re all tired here, Joe. Just
give us your last name.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: …Okay, fine, what’s in a name? But you
remember the gun, right, in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: And you remember that you told me you
thought he was going to hit you, right? That’s why you shot…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: How’d it happen, Joe, tell me how it
happened. You saw him driving toward you –</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: – I saw him driving toward me –</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Then what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You ran.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: He was going to hit me… I was scared… he
was going to hit me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: That’s why you shot him.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s why I…</p>
<p><strong>joe’s voice</strong>: …shot him.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Helluva nice shot, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: It’s the middle of the day.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just talk.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I need you to do something.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Good, I need the money.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This isn’t a deal. Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I got perishables, okay?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: The guy we did the last deal with is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Somebody popped him that night, probably
when he tried to unload the stuff. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Jesus, does anybody –</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: – Don’t worry, there’s no connection. We
got the guy who did it.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You scared the hell outa me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We just need you to do one thing.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He’ll be third from the left. Don’t fuck
up. Third from the left.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What’m I supposed to say?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just look at ’em and then look at the man
the third from the left and say, It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: And I’ll say, Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: And you say, Absolutely. No question.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: This is all I need to do right?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We have a signed confession. You i.d. him,
he’s goin’ straight into the can.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Okay, okay. But this is it. I’m not doin’
anything more than this.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, it’s a done deal.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Stop and face front.</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: Lift your heads, look straight.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Take your time. Try and remember his
face.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know him.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If you can identify the man –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know him.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just tell us which one.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No. I fucking know him.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: There’s no problem! Do you see him up
there?!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>one of the men</strong>: Hey, come on, do it or don’t!</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: No talking.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Pick the asshole out!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Third man from the left.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You mind telling me what that was all
about?!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I know him. He hangs around my building. He
lives in the alley or something.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You don’t think people that hang around
your neighborhood can kill somebody. Well let me tell you something. You
don’t live in a great fuckin’ neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just sign the goddamn paper.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What paper?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You picked a man out of a lineup, you
have to sign that you did that so they don’t think we made it up.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Now why the hell would they think something
like that?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Sign it.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You said all I had to do was pick him
out.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is part of it. Just sign it and you’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: How come you’re so sure it was him?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He confessed.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We got it in writing.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: How the hell d’you know that? Were you with
him at the time?! You have a good goddamn alibi for him?!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Maybe she was blowing him!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Better him than you.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Fine, I got nothin’ at stake here.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is what they call an open and shut
case. He did the kill and he’s going down. Don’t make the mistake of
thinking you know the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Doe?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: He wouldn’t give us his last name.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: He signed a confession but he wouldn’t give
you his last name?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He said he couldn’t remember it. He’s a
head case.</p>
<p><strong>agent hooper</strong>: You run prints?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No priors.</p>
<p><strong>agent sarkasian</strong>: Ballistics match?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We’re waiting. But a forty-four was used
in commission. He had a forty- four on him.</p>
<p><strong>agent hooper</strong>: It went down pretty quick.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: It’s our street.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: I think they did a helluva job.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for
NOTHING!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I’m sorry. Hudd was too good for this to
happen… I just didn’t think he’d go down this way.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Good work. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>capt. henderson</strong>: Do me a favor. Make sure this one
sticks. I don’t want the D.E.Assholes back in here.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: Cynthia… pretty name. What do the
first three letters spell?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Word is he killed a DEA undercover… Word is
he shot him in the face… Word is he signed a confession.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Word is everyone’s entitled to a defense… no
matter how guilty they are.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s detoxing. I gave him something to help
him through it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Can I talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I’m Elliot Goff. I’m your attorney… Do you
understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: – when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered
the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber
pistol in his hand. He entered the house with one thing in mind. To kill
George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage
to Carol’s sister, Paula.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: George and Carol were watching a movie when
he entered the living room and opened fire. George was killed instantly,
hit in the face. Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her
chest.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then the defendant, in his effort to cover up
the crime, doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire…
Carol was still alive.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will
prove to you, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Clyde
David Dunner, is guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.</p>
<p><strong>judge weinberg</strong>: The defense may now proceed.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: – Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: – I don’t know where?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: They looked all over –</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: They can’t find the murder
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Dunner’s .44. They can’t find the
goddamn gun!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: They lost it or something. Misplaced it,
I don’t know. They can’t find it anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: – I don’t have a goddamn case without the
goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have to
have the fucking gun or he’s gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth
will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: The Dunner gun, you used the fucking
Dunner gun?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was
supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a
goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence!
Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don’t point your finger at
me!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Alright, alright… But how are we supposed
to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two
different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We don’t explain it. It’s not our fault
they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner’s
case. All we need is another gun.</p>
<p><strong>the gun seller</strong>: All my merchandise is in top
condition. Untraceable. The best money can buy.</p>
<p><strong>the gun seller</strong>: It’s got good knock down, but it’s
slow. Unless you have a preference for revolvers, I suggest a nine
millimeter auto. They are more expensive, but what they cost in money,
they save in time.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: The .44.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the gun seller</strong>: You look like police.</p>
<p><strong>the gun seller</strong>: No offense.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe, I’m Elliot, we met the other… well, you
weren’t in very good shape. You look much better.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Have a chair. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: About what I did.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe, before we get into what happened that
night, I’d like to check a couple of things first. Joe is your first
name, I assume Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What about Doe? Is that what you told the
officers your last name was?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What did you tell them your last name
was?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Well, is Doe your last name?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Do you know what your last name is?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe, I’m your attorney, I’m here to help
you. It doesn’t matter if you give the court your last name or not, they
will still put you on trial. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: So there’s no reason to try and hide your
identity. What is your last name?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I would tell you if I could remember.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Okay. Look, we’ll move on. You understand
the charges against you. They’re serious. And if you are found guilty,
you could go to prison for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Maybe I should.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Go to prison. I killed him. I didn’t mean
to. But he was going to hit me.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, I know, I read your confession. Joe, if
you really felt your life was in danger, we might be able to use
self-defense as our argument. But before we get into that… Do you have
any family, Joe? Any friends?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe… do you know what a psychiatrist is?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Joe, you don’t remember much about
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …but you remember the night you shot the man
in the car.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …because… I can… I’m sorry, I’m not much
help.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: – and when you approached the suspect in his
apartment, did you identify yourself as a police officer?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did the suspect respond?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yes, he did?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In what way?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He started shooting through the door.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The Defendant fired six times, until his gun
was empty. We would like to show you the weapon he used.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And we would like to enter it into court
records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously
murder George and Carol Beaman.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven
J. Allen to the stand.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Steven J. Allen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>steven j. allen</strong>: I am a lab technician for the
police department. One of my duties is to examine weapons used in
violent crimes.</p>
<p><strong>steven j. allen</strong>: I tested the defendant’s revolver
and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the
deceased.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That ain’t my gun.</p>
<p><strong>judge weinberg</strong>: I must remind the defendant that he
is not to speak out when –</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That ain’t my gun!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We gotta put the right gun back.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We can’t put the right gun back! Without
that gun, they won’t convict Joe.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Without that gun they won’t convict
Clyde!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m not worried about Clyde, I’m worried
about us!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Look, Joe’s never goin’ to trial, right.
He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and
shut. Clyde’s the one we gotta worry about. We can’t let him go back on
the street! He’s a fuckin’ psychopath. He’ll kill somebody again.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke
know it wasn’t his fuckin’ gun?! I don’t think he knows his own fuckin’
mother, but he knows his fuckin’ gun!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I don’t think that’s important right
now.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Sorry, Divinci, can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What d’you mean you can’t do it? I gotta
check something.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: You gotta get written permission from
the Chief.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Since when?!</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Since an hour ago when he came down
here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Something about missing evidence or
who the hell knows. I just wanna transfer the hell outa here.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What the hell’re we supposed to do?!</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Ask the chief. Policy ain’t my
department!</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Whenever you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: We would like to plead not guilty to the
charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But I did it.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But I signed the confession.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, Joe. Don’t worry about it. I’m the
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your honor, can we have a moment?</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Council may approach the
bench.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your honor, my colleague’s client admits to
the killing. I don’t see any reason to go through a trial when it’s
obvious he would like to plead guilty.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I don’t agree.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If he wants to plead guilty, you have to let
him plead guilty.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Not if he’s not of sound mind.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on, Elliot!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I think he’s crazy. I know you think he’s
just putting it on, that’s D.A. standard procedure, but I don’t think he
is. So, your honor, I’m standing by the not guilty because I believe
he’s incapable of making that judgment.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Have you had a psychiatrist look
at him?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, your honor. I think you’ll see that my
diagnosis is not without warrant.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: I’ll review the findings and make
my decision tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Thank you, your honor. Besides, I hear
there’s a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Nobody can connect us to the evidence
thing… we’re clean there.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: The most important one is this DEA mess
anyway. Once that’s finished, we’re completely in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You know we can’t do it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: …yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No, we’re through. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Good while it lasted though. A hundred
grand apiece. Not bad for a few nights work.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I just wanna get through this.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We’re gonna get through it. No evidence
problems on this one.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I hope not… I don’t know, Frank, lately I
been thinkin’… maybe what we did wasn’t such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, we took out a few scumbags, that’s it.
Nobody’s ever gonna miss those shitheels. They were all pieces of
garbage. Not one of ‘em had a sheet less than a mile long. Drugs,
extortion, assault. They were all fuckin’ guilty as hell and still on
the street, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Except the cop.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah, except the cop. That’s part of the
job. Could just as easily have happened to you or me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: But we’re cops, you know? We fucked
up.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We fucked up once. Once outa ten. That’s
not bad. I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry. He was in the wrong place at the
wrong time, what can I say. I’m not goin’ down for it.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Look, if we got paid a decent salary we
wouldn’t be tempted by this, right? And what happens when we retire? You
think our pension’s gonna take care of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I
mean all I want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple
drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin’ music. That ain’t much for twenty years
putting murdering assholes behind bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps,
the killers, they got no rules. We got all the fuckin’ rules. It ain’t
fair. That’s all I’m sayin’, it ain’t fair… For awhile, we made it
fair.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Quit thinkin’ you’re a bad guy. You’re not
a fuckin’ bad guy. You made one mistake. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Do you think we’re corrupt?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, I never took a fuckin’ bribe in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Nobody ever bought me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: No fuckin’ way. Even the thought makes me
sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It’s two
completely different things. Don’t get ’em confused.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m telling you. It’s nothin’ to do with
corrupt.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I’m worried, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, you gotta worry a little. It’s
natural. Just don’t lose your sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: My sense of humor, right.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: The problem with people is, nobody gives a
shit about makin’ the world a better place. You and me, I don’t care
what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what
happens. There are ten less drug dealin’ assholes on the street today
because of us. They’re not plea bargainin’ their way back onto the
street, they’re not clogging up the courts, and they’re not costing the
tax payers a fuckin’ penny because they’re not in prison. They were
garbage. And there’s nothin’ wrong with takin’ out the garbage.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: So, you think you’ll get back with
Caroline?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Shit. Nothin’ I ever do is good enough, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Never is, never was, never will be.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Guess I gotta make the effort. It’s gonna
cost me if I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Tell me about it. You know how much I got
left.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You’re gonna think I’m an idiot, but… I
like Cynthia. There’s no bullshit with her. I just fuckin’ like her.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I think you just like fuckin’ her.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah, that, too.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What the hell, Joe, at least you won’t get
run over.</p>
<p><strong>judge weinberg</strong>: The defendant will stand and face
the jury.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: What is your verdict?</p>
<p><strong>jury foreman</strong>: We find the defendant, Clyde David
Dunner, not guilty.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Fuckin’ A!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: – when was the last time you saw him? –
Uh-huh – And you haven’t seen him since then?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just a second. Calm down. I heard. Clyde
walked.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: No! They’re takin’ Joe to trial.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: They found him mentally unable to plead
so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You gotta be kiddin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah, that’s me, I love to make people
laugh. You hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Who the hell’re you and what the fuck are
you doing in here?!</p>
<p><strong>dressing room.</strong>: I suggest you get out before Bob
gets here. He doesn’t like assholes.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: You’re Cynthia Webb.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: But you are Cynthia Webb the famous
dancer, yes?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: I liked your show very much.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What the hell’s this?!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: A subpoena?! For what?! I didn’t do
anything!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Oh shit… oh shit. He served me! He fuckin’
served me!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>another man’s voice</strong>: Detective Divinci?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>another man’s voice</strong>: This is Sergeant Gardner down
at the station.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant gardner</strong>: Sorry to call so late, but I got a
hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant gardner</strong>: I told her I couldn’t call you at
home, but she said that it was very important. A matter of, you know,
life and death.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant gardner</strong>: Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Tell her to wait, I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What the hell’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I gotta go down to the station.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Now? What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Frank, this is no way to repair our marriage,
you know?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Frank, I can’t do this. He came to the
club. You gotta –</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Not here!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I thought you said all I had to do was pick
him out?! That’s what you said, that’s all I had to do. I did what you
said. But that was supposed to be all.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: They want me in court.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You promised me I wasn’t gonna have to do
anything! What the hell is goin’ on?!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I can’t do this, Frank. I can’t go into
court. I’m gettin’ outa here!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You are not getting outa here!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Well I can’t go to court! THAT’S NOT</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Fine. Think away.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Look, you’re a witness, that’s all. You got
nothin’ to worry about. You saw something happen –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: – What?! What did I see?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I will tell you everything you gotta know.
You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Hi, Joe. You’re looking much better.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I guess jail’s been good for me.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Trial date’s been set for Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ve been thinking about what I did… and I
don’t think it’s right that I try getting off.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I want to plead guilty. I killed a man and
I should be punished.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: …I’m a little surprised.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Nobody ever wants to be punished for what
they’ve done. It’s just a new concept. But I still think our defense is
reasonable. I don’t believe, under the condition you were in, that you
were responsible for your actions.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But why was I carrying a gun? I had no
right to carry a gun.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: If you hadn’t been carrying the gun, you
might be dead.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And he might be alive.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I understand… Can I think about this?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No. I’ve made up my mind.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What if she takes off?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Then we got no goddamn witness puts him at
the scene.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: And what happens if she testifies and
nobody fuckin’ believes her?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Perjury, maybe. But that’s a fifty fifty.
They might believe her.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Shit, Frank, she’s a goddamn stripper for
Chrissake, who’s gonna believe her. I don’t believe her when she’s
telling the truth!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Ahh, we got two bodies out here and three
more in the house.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I was just wondering if you were gonna be
the primary on this one, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah, yeah, we’re comin’. Just give us some
room.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: She could blow the whole thing. She could
tie us in and that would be it. We’d be fuckin’ fried.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If it looks like she’s gonna crumble we’ll
take steps.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What steps?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: One more chalk outline more or less in this
city who’s gonna know?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Oh shit, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Hey, hey, you think I like this?!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We just can’t go around killin’
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just a second. Look around. Whatta we got
here? Two stiffs on the street, shot to shit, three more inside. That’s
five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one
city. Let me fill you in on some statistics, we’re not killin’
everybody. Look, this is strictly last resort. Okay? But let’s not kid
ourselves. If push comes to shove, somebody has to go down. If you got
another candidate, I’m willin’ to listen.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Cynthia Webb?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …yeah.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I’m Richard Stein with the District
Attorney’s office. You’re a witness in a case we’re handling and I’d
like to talk to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Ms Webb?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Any chance we could get together
today?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’m ah… pretty busy.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: It won’t take long. Will you be home
about two? Ms Webb?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah, okay… two.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Good. Let me make sure I’ve got your
correct address.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Mr. Baylor is here.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Nathan. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like some
coffee, juice.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. You
certainly got my attention with your phone call. What’s this all
about?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Is there something you want me to see?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Cynthia.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Divinci?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Richard Stein, D.A.’s office.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn’t expect – what’re
you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A
witness in – well, wait, aren’t you and Detective Rodriguez on this
one?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah, yeah, that’s why I’m here. I wanted
to go over some of the details.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Me, too. Is she there?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I was supposed to meet her at two. Do
you know her?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Well, I just mean, if she’s not here…
you were… …inside.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she’s a
witness in a murder case. And when they don’t answer a knock and the
door’s open, it’s my experience, you know. I like to make sure there’s
no dead bodies layin’ around. Don’t tell on me.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: No, no, of course not… Well, maybe I
should wait. She might be stuck in traffic or something.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. I’d
like to talk to her, too.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: See you in court.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Elliot Goff?</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Arthur Baylor?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Arthur Baylor, oh my God. I ahh, would you
ahh… are you here to see me?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: William.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you telling me?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She missed the appointment? She forget you
were coming? What?!</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: If you want my best guess, I’d say
she split.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She split, our witness split… Can’t we keep
our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here? I mean what do
I have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car? What the fuck is going
on?! I want that bitch back here and on the stand or in jail!</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I’ll get her.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: – yeah, uh-huh. Why you think he’d go
there?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Not just a second, now!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: I’ll call you back. What d’you want,
Divinci?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I got a witness who took off. I gotta get
her back. I don’t got a lotta time.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You’re the fuckin’ police. What’re you comin’
to me for?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Don’t ask fuckin’ questions, you just find
her!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Where’ve I seen her before?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: She dances.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Yeah, right, okay. So what’d she take off
for?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I said –</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: – I know what you fuckin’ said, but you want
me to find her I gotta know why the fuck she took off! So I know where
not to look! Okay?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: …she’s supposed to testify. She got scared,
thinks somebody might kill her, so she’s hidin’. That’s why I want you
to find her. If somebody is tryin’ to pop her, I don’t want anyone
knowin’ where she is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn’t believe anything
anybody tells him. Especially in his business.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: How long I got?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Two days.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Shit, two fuckin’ days!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Find her, puss head.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Sure, Detective. Always like to help out the
police whenever possible!</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: Isn’t that Arthur Baylor?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag
and recognize the principles for which it stands. The Criminal Court,
Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine
presiding.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Please be seated and come to order.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: The People versus Joe Doe in case number
95-24705.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Before we proceed, I’d like to
ask the Defense if there’s anything this court should be made aware
of.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, your honor. I have joined the defense
in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall, otherwise known to
this court as Joe Doe.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I have represented the McCall family for
several years before William McCall’s disappearance seven years ago. It
was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these
tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow
the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now
being known.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: How long do you need.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: One week should be sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Any objection to a week’s
continuance by the State?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t… believe so, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Then I grant a one week
continuance. We will start the proceedings next Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: – when it was discovered that the man
who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent, was actually
himself thought dead for seven years. The man who signed the confession
as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall.
Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation
involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and
other related industries. The net worth of both men is estimated at over
a billion dollars –</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: – but William McCall shunned the business
world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from
Harvard in 1969. Once again he turned his back on the established norm
and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the
poor.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? A
goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He was living in the fuckin’ street! How
the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor?!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: He’s not a goddamn doctor! You picked a
fuckin’ Saint to pin a fuckin’ murder on!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: When we pick ‘em, we really fuckin’ pick
‘em. We shoulda just picked up the fuckin’ Pope.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: – he disappeared seven years ago on
September 19 two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young
children in a multiple vehicle accident. At the time it was assumed that
he had returned to Africa, but that was never confirmed. What William
McCall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court
will try to help unravel.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Alright, alright, let’s think here. What’s
the worse case scenario?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Are you asking me if I can think of
something worse than what we’ve done that we can still do, or something
worse that might happen to us if this all blows up and we are convicted
and sent to jail and die in the electric chair and go to hell?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Work with me here.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m a little on edge. Would
you repeat the question?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Even if the doc walks, there’s no evidence
ties us to it. There’s only one person who can connect us to Hudd.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Okay, fine, I don’t wanna argue about it
anymore. Let’s just fuckin’ kill her.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Are you fuckin’ with me?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: No, I’m not fuckin’ with you. Are you
fuckin’ with me?!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Well this is a good one. You’re a cop and you
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Cops got her. Ain’t that a gas. Cops got her,
you’re a cop, and you gotta find out from me. It’s a crazy world we live
in, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Cops?! What fuckin’ cops?!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: I don’t know what fuckin’ cops. All I know
is, my people got to her sister’s place and she was already gone. Her
sister said some cops took her. I thought it was you!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: What an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You’re a good judge of character.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: – look, she’s our witness, if she’s in
custody, somebody better tell me!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Nothin’. Nobody knows nothin’. The D.A.
thinks she’s gone. D.E.A. doesn’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If she was bein’ held by police, we’d
know.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Unless she said somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: If she said something we wouldn’t be
sittin’ here. I think it’s that lyin’ piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Don’t ever lie to me again.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: First trial, huh.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I got one piece of advise. When you break
for lunch, don’t get the pastrami.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>the bailiff’s voice</strong>: Hear ye, hear ye. All rise,
face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: The Criminal Court, Department G is
now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding. Please be seated
and come to order.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff’s voice</strong>: The People versus William McCall in
case number 95-24705.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: – when he pulled this gun and fired at the
driver of the car. Killing him instantly. Let the record show that this
is the weapon used in the crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four caliber
handgun.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: All these goddamn guns are startin’
to look the same to me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And when you arrested the defendant, did he
deny that he had killed Agent Hudd.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Can you describe the defendant’s condition at
the time of his arrest.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: He was drunk. We could smell the booze on
him. But we drew blood. He didn’t object.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We have the blood test report that shows – –
that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would like
to enter this into evidence.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: – and you arrested the defendant four days
after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You ask questions. Work the neighborhood.
Find out who was on the street that night.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no
previous criminal record.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We found someone who’d seen him in the
area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn’t expect it to be
him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk
to him. If he wasn’t the killer, he might’ve seen the killer. Just
routine really.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Where did you find the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: On the street. Corner of Third and
Madison.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: What was he doing?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: He was passed out.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: But you knew it was the man you were looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Based on what?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: His description.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Who provided you with the description?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Cynthia something, I think.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: I believe her name is Cynthia Webb.
According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the
line- up. The name familiar?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yes… that’s her.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Where did you find Ms Webb?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: On the street. Same area.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: And she agreed to pick the defendant out of
a line up.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Where you aware that Ms Webb disappeared
after she was served with a subpoena?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yes, my partner and I tried to contact
her about the case and were unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Thank you, Detective, that’s all the
questions I have.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: To justice in all its forms.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We’re not home free yet.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Without Ms Webb, there’s no place they can
go. We still got the confession, the gun, the ballistics… And I don’t
give a shit about all this African doctor crap… the man is a drunk and
he’s been a drunk for seven goddamn years. So lets have a drink for
drunks.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: That’s the thing about life. You control it
or it controls you. Most people don’t understand that. They try’n blame
their fuck-ups on something or somebody else. But it’s not like that. I
don’t wanna hear why your life’s a mess. It’s a mess cause you’re a
mess. That simple. They’re waitin’ to live happily ever after. But after
what? After all the shit happens? Well, I got a clue for everybody, the
shit never stops happening. So you deal with it or you get buried in it.
I’m not talkin’ about you, you know what I’m sayin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Life don’t work in mysterious ways. There
ain’t no mystery to it. You just work it. And you don’t take it too
serious. You can’t take it too serious otherwise you get fragile. And
you can’t be fragile and have any fuckin’ fun.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You think I’m fragile?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: That’s the first sign of trouble, when you
start askin’ other people.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: …I just wish I knew where the hell she
was.</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: – so I think we’ll have to rely on
the confession for his description of what happened. He’ll never take
the stand, even if –</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: D.A.’s office… What?… When?… Where
will –</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: They found Cynthia Webb.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well who the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>richard stein</strong>: I don’t know. They hung up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What the fuck is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your honor, the people call Ms. Cynthia Webb
to the stand.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Raise your right hand.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: You swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help you God.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: You may be seated.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I know her.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: She’s the woman who identified you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No. I mean I know her.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: …How?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m not sure… I think I lived near her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please state your name for the court.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Cynthia Webb.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you see the man that you identified in a
police line-up in this room.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please describe what you saw the night of
September 14th.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I was comin’ out of an all night minimart
–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And you’re positive the man you saw with the
gun is the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Miss Webb… is it Miss?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant
before that night, the night you described to us?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Do you know what perjury is?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: When you lie.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: When you lie under oath in a court of law.
Do you know what the penalty for that is?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes… Cynthia, have you ever seen the
defendant before that night?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Objection. The witness has already answered
that question.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I just want to give the witness the
opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else
before the night in question.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Ms. Webb, do you understand the
consequences of perjury?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Let’s get on with it then.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What did you buy the night you went into the
mini-mart?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What did I buy?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You remembered seeing Mr. McCall that night
and hearing the gunshot and a car crash. I just wondered if you
remembered what you bought in the mini-mart.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …shampoo I think.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: 4356 17th Street. Number 37.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Is that close to where this mini- mart
is?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Close? Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How far would you say?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Within walking distance?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No… I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Did you walk there that night or drive?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I ahh… drove.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You drove. But when you left the mini-mart
you stated that you walked down the street.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …to the corner.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Objection. Your honor, I don’t see a point to
this line of questioning.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Is there a point?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Yes, your honor. Since this is the only
witness, I’m trying to establish what the scene was like that night.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Try to get there as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And how far away from the corner was the
Mini-mart? For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the
corner, where?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: In the middle I think.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So you walked all the way to the corner. I
assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Was there a reason you parked so far
away?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Um… there were lots of cars parked on the
street.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Was there anyone else on the street besides
you?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Lots of cars, but no people. Any
traffic?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So you were the only person to see Joe on
the street that night?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I didn’t see anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So you heard a gunshot, a car crash and a
man running with a gun in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What did you do then? Did you call the
police, 911?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I went home.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You went home. Straight home?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And you’re sure it was Joe you saw that
night?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: When you went home.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: When you went home you saw Joe?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the
witness.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m not trying to confuse the witness, it’s
the witness that’s trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who
will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night
of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot,
who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment
building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn’t that
right, Ms Webb?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who
I was talking about, didn’t you. This case is the People versus
Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial.
How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe was the
defendant?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He lived in the alley next to my apartment
building.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why did you lie to this court?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Are you afraid of somebody?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Are you protecting somebody?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>judge harold pine</strong>: Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or
I’ll be forced to cite you for contempt.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: She didn’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You think she’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I know she’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: We’ll make it look gang related.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Problem is we’re gonna need another
gun.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: The problem?! Have you forgotten? She’s
in fucking jail. That’s the goddamn problem.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a
long life? You just get a fuckin’ gun.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Oh shit. I didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Everything’s fine, Manny. I just came to
apologize. We need some privacy…</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just one more favor. I want you to bail
somebody out of jail.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You’re kiddin’.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Bail’s twenty-five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I want her out tonight. And don’t tell her
who. It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: And how’m I payin’ for this? They don’t take
American Express.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I know you know how to exchange that. It’s
worth a lot more than twenty- five grand. You can keep the change. I
want her back in two hours… Or I’ll nail you for possession.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: How’d you get to be such a prick?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: What a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You don’t have to say nothin’, but… you
really a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I was… a surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon. I know
I’m nobody to judge, but you musta been a smart guy. What the hell’s a
smart guy like you doin’ in here?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I had an affair with another woman… a
nurse at the hospital I worked at. It was nothing… I can’t even remember
much about her… Except my wife found out. We had a fight. She left the
house, took the kids… She was hysterical. I should’ve done something…
gone after them, I don’t know… they were killed in a car accident about
a mile from the house… I’ve never told anybody that… about why she
left.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Hey, doc, you can trust me. It won’t go no
farther.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You get the gun?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Are you kidding? We’re going to kill a
goddamn witness who’s in fucking jail because we killed an undercover
DEA agent. I’m sorry, but this kinda shit troubles me a little.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Take off the dress and get back in the
game. We gotta do what we gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah. I know. Let’s just get it over
with.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t understand. Why can’t you tell me
who put up the bond?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Look, a guy comes in, says bail her out,
gives me the money, I do it. That’s how I make my living, I bail fuckin’
people outa jail. You wait with me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Was it a cop?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa jail all
the time. Doesn’t there seem to be a dichotomy there for you?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You wanna stay in jail, that’s up to you. Or
you come with me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What’d he look like?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You’re a stripper right? Lotta guys fall in
love with your type. But they don’t know how to get close, know what I
mean? Somebody wants you to owe them something. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: This is the last time, Frank. The last
time we kill somebody.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Yeah, it’s the last time.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: This’ll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is
enough.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: It was all okay until you shot Hudd.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What’s goin’ on here? You mad at me or
something?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: It wasn’t my idea to start killing
people, Frank. That’s all I’m sayin’. We’re in this goddamn mess because
you started killing people.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Drug dealers don’t qualify as people. Never
did, never will. So what the hell’s wrong with you tonight? You suddenly
worried about where all the money went?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I’m just sick of it, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I need some fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Frank –</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin’ talk to
me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I don’t know… I owe some money. I don’t
know how I’m gonna pay it…</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You gambling again?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah, yeah… I just couldn’t… Frank… let’s
forget about this. Let’s just get the fuck outa here. We got enough
money, let’s go. We’ll get outa the country or something.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What the hell’re you doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just take off your shirt. If there’s
nothin’ to worry about, then I’ll apologize. But I’m not gonna argue.
Take off your fuckin’ shirt now.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: What is this, you piece of shit?! You
don’t trust me?! Is that it?!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: …Take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Fuck you, you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m askin’ you one more time.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. I’m fuckin’
nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing… shit. Let’s just get it over
with.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’ll just feel a whole lot better when
she’s dead. Then we’re off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Yeah… yeah… I am, I’m a fuckin’ rat… I
traded you, Frank, I fuckin’ traded you… Simms knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Just fuckin’ shoot me, get it the fuck
over with! I DESERVE IT! I</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You’re fuckin’ right.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: …Get out.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Frank –</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Get outa the car NOW!</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: This is why you can never – ever – lose
your sense of fuckin’ humor.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I guess we caught you at a bad
time.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: But we all have problems.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin’ shot
him!</p>
<p><strong>agent sarkasian</strong>: Divinci musta figured it. I didn’t
think he’d kill his own partner though.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: He’s an animal.</p>
<p><strong>agent hooper</strong>: Recorders busted up. But we might be
able to salvage some of the tape.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I want him. You understand me, I don’t care
what it takes. I want that sonuvabitch!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Shit! Who the fuck’re you?!</p>
<p><strong>agent sarkasian</strong>: Ms. Webb. We’d like you to come
with us.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: This was the big secret? Shit. You’re an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Who set it up?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>agent hooper</strong>: It was Divinci wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci or
Rodriguez?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was shot in
the head last night.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci
found it. You can do addition, can’t you.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>agent sarkasian</strong>: Just tell us what you know.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Where’s Divinci?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: We don’t know. But we’re gonna find him.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You’re gonna find him? Right… I don’t know
a fuckin’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Get a copy of the tape to Bailor. But make
sure it doesn’t come from us.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Your attorney’s here.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What attorney?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I got nothin’ to say.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: …Take off your shirt…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez’s voice</strong>: Fuck you, you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: I’m askin’ you one more time.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez’s voice</strong>: You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: Okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. I’m
fuckin’ nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing… shit. Let’s just get
it over with. I’ll just feel a whole lot better when she’s dead. Then
we’re off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez’s voice</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez’s voice</strong>: Yeah… yeah… I am, I’m a fuckin’
rat… I traded you, Frank, I fuckin’ traded you… Simms knows everything.
Just fuckin’ shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: You’re fuckin’ right.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I think you know my client is innocent.
That’s all I care about, my client. But I understand why you’re scared.
You’re already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is
deeper than that. But I don’t really care, I’m not after you… I get
nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my
client.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: …how?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: William – Joe – didn’t do it, did he?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Why don’t you sit down.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: No goddamn way! I’m not going to grant that
whore immunity. She lied on the stand, she’s protecting somebody. And
she’s involved. I want them all.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Before I leave, let me remind you that you
have shit for a case. If you really care about seeing justice for your
dead agent, don’t blow this deal. Immunity for her testimony is a small
price for a bad cop. It’s the only way she’s going to talk.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And William McCall walks, right now, all
charges dropped.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: If what she says is any good, I’ll deal. If
it isn’t, then nobody goes anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: How does it feel to be a free man
again?</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Do you remember everything that happened
to you? What are your plans?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I just want to go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: As a surgeon?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: What about the signed confession, did the
police coerce you into signing it?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’m sorry, no more questions.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Good to have you back, Will.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I’d like to make one stop.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: – you know, it just didn’t make sense, a man
wanting to be punished for a crime? How many times does that happen?
Once in a lifetime, I can tell you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: – to tell the truth, I had no other
witnesses to refute her testimony. But she didn’t know that. All we knew
was that she was reluctant to testify. You look for signs.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: My God, we thought you were dead, you know.
It’s just incredible that you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>a woman</strong>: Life moves in such strange ways. Oh, I just
think what might’ve happened to you had you not been arrested for
killing that poor policeman. You still might be on the street.</p>
<p><strong>another woman</strong>: Joe, you look wonderful. After what
you’ve been through… I just can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: When you’re ready to come back to work,
let me know. I’ve already spoken to the board, they’re ready to re-
certify you anytime. I can put you in the emergency sector until you get
warmed up. We all want you back. We can’t afford to waste someone of
your talent.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I guess you had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You had to do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What d’you want?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: What do I want?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Why’re you asking me that? You gonna grant
me three wishes? I don’t know where to start. Let’s see… money would be
nice… love would be better… but a little loyalty… you can never get
enough of that. …But we’ll start with… money.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: This is all I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: They’ll catch you.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: You wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: They don’t have a clue, baby. And you wanna
know why? Because I am following my heart.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: And they don’t know where that is.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: So tell me about your plans. I think I’d
like to hear ’em now.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Loyalty is what it all comes down to.
Nothing holds together when it’s gone. And once it’s gone, you don’t
ever get it back… You shouldn’t’ve told ’em.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I shouldn’t’ve done a lotta things in my
life. But that’s not one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Let me tell you something… the only
difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of ’em knows
what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>divinci’s voice</strong>: Shut the door and lock it.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You scared the shit outa me.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: One more favor, Manny.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Since when did I become such a good guy?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I’m takin’ some time off. I want a car,
here tonight, and a driver. You can do that for your old friend,
right?</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Yeah, I can do that. But you are a hot
fuckin’ potato. And drivers that don’t talk, don’t come cheap.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I got the money. Just put it together.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: – come on, hang in there, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>other surgeon</strong>: Just like riding a bike.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Leather upholstery, moon roof, CD. What more
could you ask for?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Better not be a set up.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Want me to hold your hand?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Just walk me to the door.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: I think I’ll let you live.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: You are a real prince. Now how about my
money?</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You never saw me.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Don’t I wish that were true.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: Have a nice trip.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: Head south. Get on the interstate. Don’t
break the speed limit.</p>
<p><strong>divinci</strong>: You know, the one thing about life… you can
never lose your sense of humor. Without it, you got nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: – run the cardioplegia.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: She’s fibrilating. Go on bypass.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon sinclair</strong>: Forceps. Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I wouldn’t have done this without you… I
owe you.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon sinclair</strong>: Lucky to have a donor. Never
would’ve survived the night. Have a suture ready.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I heard it was a cop’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He was shot in the head a couple hours
ago.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: They think it was gang related.</p>
