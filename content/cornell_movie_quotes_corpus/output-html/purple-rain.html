<p><strong>prince</strong>: Dearly belov`ed, We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life. Electric word life, It means
forever and that’s a mighty long time. But I’m here to tell you that
there’s something else – The afterworld.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: That’s right…a world of never-ending
happiness, You can always see the sun – Day or night.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: So when you call up that shrink in Beverly
Hills, You know the one – Doctor Everything’ll Be Alright– Instead of
asking him how much of your mind is left, Ask him how much of your time,
`Cause in this life, Things are much harder than in the afterworld, In
this life, You’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: And if de-elevator tries to bring you down,
Go crazy, punch a higher floor.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, Lord …</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: We’re going to slay him… Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I have an appointment with the manager.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: No you don’t – he doesn’t see anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What are you retarded or something?! Why don’t
you look where you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Sorry … where’s the office?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Do you think you can just come in here and
take over?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I said I’m sorry – what do you want me to
do? Where’s the office?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No one’s in!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Okay, so you got me back, fine. Listen, I’m
from out of town. I have to see the manager, it’s important. I’m a real
good singer and dancer. I know he could use me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Do you have any experience?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yeah…definitely.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Here, fill this out – I’ll have him call
you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I don’t have a phone. When will he be
back?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well…you can try tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You can count on it.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Vanity??</p>
<p><strong>backstage</strong>: as Morris and The Time pass Prince on
their way to the stage–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Why don’t you stay awhile, see how it’s
done.</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen – please welcome The
Time.</p>
<p><strong>club</strong>: Sudden APPLAUSE and CRIES. Vanity and Jill
turn directly into the path of Prince, descending the Steps of the
stage. Vanity gasps, LOCKS eyes with him. Jill seems to jump out of her
skin – it’s obvious she has a crush on him something awful–</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hi ya, Prince – God I liked that song, it’s
real fun.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I really liked your song too…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hey …</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey wait!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen to me! You come home when I say come
home! You’ve got no business in the streets!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You do what I say, do you hear me?! You’ve
got to keep this place clean! You here, no place else!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Motherfucker!!!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Please, Dad…she’s heard you. She’s had
enough!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s trying to kill me! He’s crazy! Look
what he’s doing to me!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Dad, please … she’s–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Get up…you ain’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What…what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Huh … it’s kind of dead in here. Where is
everybody?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: In bed I guess… Oh, God … Guess what, I bought
a dog.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: That’s nice… Ah, I guess I’ll come back at a
better time. You think tonight the the place’ll be jumping?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well, I’ll be here – I always like what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Wait! I’ve got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What? A subpoena?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s a song Lisa and Wendy wrote.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Why didn’t they give it to me
themselves?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well, I liked it and wanted to listen to it.
They told me to give it to you when I was done.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You really liked it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: One, two, three, kick! One, two, three,
kick! Four, five…Oh, Lord. Cut! Cut!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You ladies don’t seem to realize how
valuable my time is. You’re going to make my boys look bad.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Why don’t you let us come up with our own
steps?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: We tried that… … remember?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Now you’re in the best possible position you
can be in, so what’ s the matter – your shoes on too tight or something?
Let’s have some action, let’s have some asses wiggling, I want some
perfection. Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I think I’m going to need a drink, a strong
drink. Let’s get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: This just ain’t happening. The bitches are
okay, but we need something more exciting-</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You’re right. We could be doing much better.
Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: That powder fine babe we saw last night.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Oooh, yeee! – Why don’t we find out who she
is?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I already know that. Jill gave me everything
last night. Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: No, no – that ain’t classy enough. I want
the bitch to come to me – I’m the only star in this town.</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Morris Day, who do you think you are?! I
waited up all night for you. I’m so tired of you doing that to me. You
think you’re so hot? You’re nothing special. This is the third time you
pulled that shit. Who the fuck do you think I am?!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>babe</strong>: Leave me alone you ape! – What are you doing
to me?! Morris!!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Lo-rd..! Such nastiness. Hee, hee – Let’s
break.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome, this car – it’s…it’s lacking
something. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Hmm… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I got it! The hubcaps. We need something
sweeter.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I think I know what it needs.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Yeah … I know what these need.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The girl has expensive tastes. I wonder if
she can sing.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: As fine as she is…she doesn’t have to know
how to sing.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I know that’s right. Hey – watch it now.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I want you to stay out of the set tonight. I
want you to work the floor.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I want to know when that sweet thing shows
up. You stay by the door, you see her, you come get me, cool?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Cool. I come get you – let you know the
girl’s there.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Well, not if I’m with my other babes. That
wouldn’t be cool. I don’t want to break their hearts, and you know how I
feel abouy that. So we ought to have like, a signal.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: A password.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Okay. What’s the password?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Got what?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The password.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The password is what?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The password is exactly?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: No, it’s–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: – Hold it now. Slow down. The babe walks in
and you see her.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I see her.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You come get me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I come get you.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: And I’ll probably have a couple little
sexies on the stand-by, and we don’t want to upset them, do we? So you
just glide by me and say…what?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The password is okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Dammit! Say the password.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Say the password, sperm breath!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The password is what.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: That’s what I’m asking you!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s the password!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The password is it?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Ahhhhh! The password is what!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It! You just said so!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The password isn’t it! The password is–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: – What?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: 1 got it?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It or right?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>shoeshine boy</strong>: Either of you do heavy drugs?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: There … on your boot.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Give it back to mel</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You can have it back later.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I want it back now, okay?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Who gave it to you?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: A person</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Female or male?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Huh …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You’re lying. I can tell just by your
reaction that you’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: So you gave it to me – it’s not yours
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You see something you like?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Let’s go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: It’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: My psychic told rne I was going to be
famous.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: How much did that cost you?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Fifty bucks. It was a good investment.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No seriously – My psychic did tell me. I was
in a play once.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Oh, yeah – what did you play?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Isadora Duncan…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: That means I can sing and dance. Want to
help me?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Want to know why?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Because you wouldn’t pass the
initiation.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What initiation?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Well, for starters ycu have to purify
yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You have to purify yourself in Lake
Minnetonka.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! Thats–</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: We made a deal!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: That ain’t Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You bastard. I don’t believe it. How could
you do that to me?!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Damn you – I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You prick! Are you sick?! Is this some kind
of ritual – getting your kicks! How many girls have you done this
to?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hey …</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Honey, you still chasing after that fool?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’m doing what I’m doing. It’s my
business.</p>
<p><strong>katy</strong>: He doesn’t even look at you. That’s the last
thing you want from a man.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You just don’t know him like I do.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Honey… Look, Listen, and then Feel. If you do
them in any other order, you’re headed for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, Jill – where’s our drinks?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They’re coming – just wait.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What you want isn’t on the menu.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jill, in ten years they’ll be on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: C’mon, c’mon …</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: BooPoo!!</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Get out of here, you jerks!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sweetheart … do you have a real hot place
where I could stick my nose?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Sure – try a microwave.</p>
<p><strong>katy</strong>: Those guys are deep.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Yeah – deeply retarded.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I’m paying … see? Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: The manager wants to see you.</p>

<p><strong>chick</strong>: He’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>billy sparks</strong>: Hi, I’m Billy Sparks, I manage this
place.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hi – I really like your club.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Really…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nine, sweets.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oh, that’s a really nice watch. Very
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You look like a guy I used to go out with –
he was a lot older, but I like older men.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Really, what a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I just came off a Broadway play. My
grandmother got sick.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Does she live here?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No, in New York … But, huh, I have a sister
here, lives in Saint … huh …</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …Paul.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ye-es. What do you want to do? You don’t want
to be a waitress do you?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No … no…Actually I was thinking more in the
way of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Of course… how about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Theatre?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dinner, then the theatre, my sweets.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oh, huh…</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Hi ya, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good evening, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Jerome – I was looking all over for you!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You know each other?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Yes, we’ve met. I have something to show
you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Great. See you later, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You rescued me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Ye-es.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi ya, Prince. I heard through the grapevine
you had a new tune written by two great girls. By chance did you hear
it?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I knew it – he didn’t listen to it. He
probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Wow! Okay…you think about this. I’m going to
be real honest with you. You’re really being full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Forget about it, Wendy. Let’s get out of
here–</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Every time we give you a song, you say you’re
going to use it, but you never do. You always think that we’re doing
something behind your back. You’re just being paranoid as usual.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Wendy…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Shut up, Lisa, please! You should know by now
that we wouldn’t hurt vou. We’re not out to put a dark cloud over your
head. It’s just to make you feel good, Prince – that’s what it’s all
about. You’ve been this way with us before, remember?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: The nominees for the best actress are–</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: – Fuck it, Wendy – let’s break!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Do you know you can really, really hurt
people? Doesn’t that mean anything to you? Doesn’t that make you feel
like shit?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: C’mon …</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I’m tired of this … I’m really tired…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You tired, too?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: God got Wendy’s periods reversed. About every
28 days, she starts acting nice. Lasts about a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What difference does it make, Prince. We’re
still a group, right?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Headcase. Telling you…’effed up headcase.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: People with talent usually are.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Of course, there are a number of headcases
without great talent too.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Honey – don’t you ever try and breastfeed no
baby now.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Never mind …</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Right. What.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ye-es What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Tea time.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: So, right.</p>
<p><strong>stagehand</strong>: Prince, five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Vanity, I’d like you to meet Morris E.
Day.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Hold it now – just leave the ‘E’ alone.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Vanity…this is Morris Day</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: The pleasure’s all mine.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: If you’d excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Too sexy … Have a waitress bring.a bottle of
their best champacne.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Your lips would make a lollipop too
happy.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You think so, huh?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ye-es.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Who’s paying for this Morris?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I think you know that. Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Huh, keep the change–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Get my change, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, Lord…either somebody put something in my
drink, or you are the finest I’ve seen in ages.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Excuse me, what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Huh…you look nice tonight.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It’s rare that I out my cards on the table
when it comes to meeting younq ladies, but … I’m going to make you love
me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Just as sure as my Stacy Adams are
shiny.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen – please welcome
Prince!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: He doesn’t like girls.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I know – he likes women.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Well … he don’t do too good with them
either.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s this intercourse, shit?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hey; man – don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m warning you…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hey – wait till we’re married, now.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Oh, my God – look at this!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Notice anything?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It looks like you!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: His hair …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Shit …</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I wanted to cheer you up.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m hungry – where’s the food?!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: We have to go to your place.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No…no, we can’t.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Why – is there someone there?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Why do you always think there’s somebody
else?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yeah – but we’re not going to my place.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: That was a grand entrance. Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: So – friends of yours?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Yeah – the freak show.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: If you think you scared me, you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Oh, yeah …</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Who’s the lucky girl? Sounds like she was
having a good time.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: She’s crying – it’s backwards. It makes me
sad when I hear it. It sorta sounds like she’s laughing, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: So what did you do to her? Do you always
treat your women like that?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t have anybody right now.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You look pretty…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: King Kong?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Damn, baby, hold it! Hold it!! Oh, God – God!
You broke my nose!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You shit! What the hell are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Shh! Shh! Shh! oh, Lord help me outta here.
Hee, hee – I know you wouldn’t want to spend the whole night with ol’
pencil dick.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Your nose alright?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: My nose is fine, I’m just wondering if I
fucked my shoes up… C’mon …</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hi, Jerome. Wow! Nice hubcaps.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You like them, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome…you think these can be fixed?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I think they’re dead, man.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: God, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Shit – it’s so rough out here.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You lock the door, baby? Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Cocktails before dinner?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Yes – two pi�a coladas.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Uh…make mine a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Will you be having a virgin as well?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ye-es! For dessert!! Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Thank you. Here you are, dear.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome, uh, get your pad and pencil, I think
it’s gonna be kinda right. If my judge of character is correct, it’s
going to be about loving tonight. Stop me when I get to seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Excuse me, baby…I bet you didn’t know I had
a piece of this restaurant, did you? May I taste that?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Huh, excuse me, that’s kind of weak…here,
try mine.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Y’know…they say that saliva is an
aphrodisiac. You look so lovely tonight.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Why…thank you.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Probably you’d look better under
exotic…red…liqhts. I wish you could see my home. It’s…it’s so
exciting.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: In my bedroom, I have a brass waterbed …</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oooh!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I have an Italian cook, Gino Izogochograchi,
or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It’s funny…your eyes – when you stare at me
like that, it causes my stomach to qui- quiver. Oh, Lord…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Do you like diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Uh, huh.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Yeah …?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I know it’s rather masculine, but – try this
one on.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: My God, darling it fits.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You must have strong hands, but – they’re so
soft…like oils in my bubble bath. Damn …</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Darling…?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I’m not usually so forward, but – would you
like to make love to me? I can make it so nice …</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Do you know what is meant by the words, huh,
I hate to use them, they’re so harsh, so American…I mean, and yet on the
other hand, they’re exciting words. The words… …chili sauce. Oh,
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You know, I haven’t made love in so long,
but with you I know it would be just like riding a bike. I’d remember
everything I’ve ever learned. Baby, if the kid can’t make you come,
nobody can.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Morris..!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Huh, what’s it gonna to be baby?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Over there – that’s where I live.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Here…?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Uh, what one is it?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: That one, right there, see? On the 14th
floor.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It’s nice, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oh, it’s great. Real pretty. Big open rooms,
balconies, fireplace – the works.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey, wait! C’mon! Okay – where are you
taking me?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Home. You and me are a lot alike.- I like
that. So, I’d like to help you out. I think I have something you may be
interested, in.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oh yeah – what?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: A little song and dance. That is, if you can
sing and dance.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Prince is goinq to help me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Motherfucker needs a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Hee, hee, uh, excuse me. No he won’t. He’s
never done anything in his whole life for anybody but himself.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Guys better than you have promised me things
before.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I know that’s right, but–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: – not Morris Day.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Come by any time.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: One more thing …</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Here’s a little something for you. If you
get cold when you wear it, call me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Morris…?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I had a feeling it was you – I knew it! It’s
amazing – I could tell it was you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: How’d you get home?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Took a cab.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Oh yeah? Where’d you get that?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I adore camisoles.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Let’s ride.</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot</strong>: Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle
whipping down the highway. The DAWN LIGHT breaks over the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>a series of shots</strong>: Streaking down a two-lane
blacktop obviously exhilarated by the velocity of their ride. The
landscape becomes lush, the trees a riot of autumn splendor.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as Prince and Vanity whip up to the
top of a small hill, skid to a stop. He scans the area quickly, gets his
bearings. He pops the clutch, skids off to the valley below.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: God, this is beautiful. It reminds me of
where I grew up. My father used to …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Your father used to what…?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Nothing…it’s just… You must like places like
this.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: So, have you reconsidered my proposal?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What we talked about last time.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Oh, come on – you know you really want to.
You’ve been waiting for this opportunity …all…your…life…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’m sorry – excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: God – so why do you come around? You don’t
want to help me, not that you have to. You don’t want to sleep with me,
not that you have to do that either. So why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: There’s a lot of things you don’t know about
me. You’d be surprised how many things I could do.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Take me home immediately! I want to go home.
I can’t stand this! I can’t take this anymore! Prince!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I don’t need this! I was doing alright
before I met you. Motherfucker, you need a haircut!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I don’t get this. Prince! Who do you think
you are?! You don’t care. You don’t care about anything! I never wanted
you to help me anyway!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You think you’re a good musician?! You’re
nothing! Morris is better. I never wanted to make it with you
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>hikers</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said those
things. Will you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: RAIN patters srtongly against the
barn. A deep THUNDER rolls. She’s on top of him, moving deliciously, her
body glowing in the purple, dawn light. Moist, purple water shadows
streak and course her skin as she moves slowly, then deliberately
against him. He watches her avidly, his hands firmly on her thighs, and
thrusts into her again and again…and again.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: See you later?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: ’Cause I have to do something first.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: A secret…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Okay, come by – eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Bye…</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: as she comes to a halt outside her room,
picking up carnations along the way. She opens her door, cuts
inside.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Miss V.?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Delivery.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Come in …</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Hey – wait a minute. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Good morning, dahling.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: You’re crazy! – What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Come down – come down.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I can’t – I’ve got things to do.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: C’mon, ten minutes. I want to show you
something-</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I’m sorry, but thanks for the flowers.
You’re really crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Well…what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Chili sauce.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, Lord…</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Is that better? Do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re late – they left.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: So what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But I’m here to tell you that there’s
something else – our music–.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Can’t you guys get off it? Can’t you just
leave it alone?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah – we’ll get off it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: As you can see, we need someone with your
special qualities.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You ain’t got no business leaving here! All
your sneaking around – you’re just a sinner! You’re nothing but a low
life sinner!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Shut up! You don’t care about me! Leave me
alone!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t I keep the heat on? Isn’t there food
in the refrigerator?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I don’t like it here. You never talk to me!
I’m always alone!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Dad, please!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What’s the matter with this house? Isn’t it
nice and warm here?!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mother.</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Motherfucker!!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m just trapped here…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You always got a roof overhead…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You don’t let me have any fun…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I could make you happy. Just believe in
me…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You never…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I would die for you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s nice here. It’s a nice house. Nothing
wrong. It’s a good family. Believe me, I know. Nothing wrong here. Your
father is okay. He’s a good man. You could learn somthing.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My, my! Don’t you think I have a good
figure? Your Father did.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I was beautiful when your Dad met me. I was
out-a-sight!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I looked just like a movie star. The minute
he saw me singing, I knew just what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He wanted to get into my panties.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You look so pretty. Just like me, honey. You
coulda been a girl.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So pretty…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I have to go now, see some friends. Don’t
tell your father, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bye, skipper…bye.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I missed you! Missed you! Missed you!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Come here. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I have a big surprise for you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Da…da..!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Oh, no… Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I love it!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I’m going to join Morris’ group.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I’m going to join Morris’ group.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’m sorry! Oh, baby, I’m sorry! Are you
alright?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Just…leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Please…it’s just… I don’t want you around
this at all. I just don’t want you in my life this way. You don’t have
to prove anything to me or anybody else. Vanity…? Don’t I make you
happy? Don.t you like the way we are? Do you know Morris? Do you know
what he’s about? He doesn’t care about you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Jealous..?!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Where’s Lisa and Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They haven’t shown up yet.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: They call?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Prince. Billy Sparks wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Tell him I’m rehearsing.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Uh, uh – now.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You having trouble?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where’s Lisa and Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Morris called me this morning. Seems he’s got
himself a new group called Vanity Six. You know anything about them?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He tells me they’re great. Thinks I’ll be
interested. That’s cool, but now I’ve got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I book three acts – I can’t afford four. If
they’re as good as Morris says they are, one of you will have to go…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Go around the block!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It won’t be The Time – they’re playing backup
to Vanity. So it’s either you or the Modern Aires. What would You do in
my position?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I like the Modern Aires. They have a good
following – they show up for practice – and the kids like all their
music.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: ’Nough said. Get smart. Straighten up your
shit.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Not now, I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I said I’m busy – we’ll talk later.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Uh, uh…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Leave me alone! I’ve got a show to do!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: YOU can’t just come in here and take me
away! We’ll talk later!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Man – why don’t you just do the walk?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Why don’t you kiss the one- eyed snake?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Jellybean!</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Let’s go, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Leave me alone, dammit! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Fucker!!</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Stay still, motherfucker!!</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Stop!!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Jellybean, please…</p>
<p><strong>jellybean</strong>: Lift him.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Don’t hurt him …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Ma…?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Hi, ya, baby…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Ma…what happened?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Can you give me some money? C’mon, just some
money…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Here…here…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Give me something for this…just a little.
It’ll be okay…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: C’mon…I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, c’mon now – break it up. Let’s go..</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: C’mon, honey – we’re goin’ in…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re a little young aren’t you? Get out of
here. Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Where the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Answer me you fucker!!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Is that yours?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: ‘Course it’s mine. Who else’s is it goin’ to
be? Got all kinds of them. They’re different too.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I’d like to see them. You got them written
down somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, man – I don’t write them down – don’t
need to. That’s the big difference between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Thought you weren’t going to play no
more.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I saw Mom up the street. She looked pretty
bad. Any idea how she got that way?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Yeah… I got a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You gonna get married?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Never get married.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What are we doing here, Morris?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to
hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: It’s not about hurting anybody. This is
business. We can use the exposure.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hi – you coming in?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Your horns are showing, Morris.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Yeah…but they’re holding up my halo.</p>
<p><strong>bar area</strong>: as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris
and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity Six for the first time. We can
tell by his reaction that he likes what he sees. He kisses Brenda and
Susan, saves a special squeeze for Vanity herself. He escorts the whole
group to a table across the floor. Vanity brings up the rear, casts a
quick look to Prince onstage.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: fastens on her and brings “Computer Blue” to
a rousing end. The Crowd applauds, but it’s more out of respect than
eagerness. He doesn’t seem to notice though, or care. He confers quickly
with his group., then moves center-stage. The Band Members trade
frustrated looks with each other – it’s obvious that they have some
trouble with the next song…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I knew a girl named Nicky, I guess you can
say she was a sex fiend. I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating in
magazines. She said, How’d you like to waste some time, And I could not
resist When I saw little Nicky grind.</p>
<p><strong>billy sparks</strong>: shoots a fierce look to Prince, helps
Morris, Jerome and the Girls to their table. Vanity is watching Prince,
a puzzled look on her face–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Hee, hee…little empty tonight, huh, Billy.
But I guess money isn’t everything.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Oh no… that’s cold…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The Duke of Dick is in rare form tonight.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: is fastened on Vanity and it’s apparent to
all. He launches into the next verse- -</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: She took me to her castle And I could not
believe my eyes. She had so many devices Everything that money could
buy. She said, Sign your name on the dotted line, The lights went out,
And Nicky started to grind.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: flushes with embarrassment. Billy and Morris
notice this and glare at Prince.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: looks dead-center at them, and then to
Vanily–</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I woke up the next morning. Nicky wasn’t
there. I looked all ov’r all I found Was a phone number on the stairs.
It said thank you for a funky time, Call me up when ev’r you want to
grind.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: stands suddenly, fighting back tears. She
backs from the table quickly, knocks the chair over. Morris tries to
help her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying for the exit.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Hey …</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: brings the SONG to a blistering end. The
stage is plunged into darkness. He strips off his guitar, cuts from the
stage, ignoring the grave looks from his Band Members.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What the fuck’s wrong with you, Prince?!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t have time for your bullshit, Billy.
What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My stage is no place for your personal
shit!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: That’s life, man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Life my ass, motherfucker! This is a
business, and you’re not too far gone to see that. I’ve told you this
before. You’re not pulling them in like you used to. The only person who
gives a fuck about your music is yourself.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Just like your old man…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah – you got it. Tell me I’m wrong. You’re
not blind. Look around you. No one’s digging you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look at your band. Are they in here right
now? They’re out there ’cause they can’t stand being in the same room
with you. What a fucking waste…like father, like son–</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Lay off that!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Take your head out of your ass, Prince, check
it out – unless you like the view up there. Your music doesn’t make
sense to anyone but yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: That was fucked up what you did man. Morris
doesn’t like it. And being a part of this - - I don’t like it
either.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Hee, hee…huh, it’s obvious you don’t have
what it takes to be on top.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: But to show you that I’m sympathetic to your
problems - - here’s a pass to our show tomorrow night. Enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Don’t forget to bring a girlfriend.
Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>int. backstage, the taste – night</strong>: Jerome stands
BACKSTAGE fidgeting nervously, staring appreciatively at the closed
dressing room door. Various PEOPLE in COSTUMES pass by sporadically.
Suddenly a burst of APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER wafts into the hallway. Jerome
walks to the curtain and peers out–</p>
<p><strong>jerome’s pov–</strong>: Billy Sparks and his Girlfriend being
seated at a front table. A COMEDIAN is on stage juggling KNIVES and
HATCHETS. The CROWD is ROARING their approval.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: cuts from the dressing room, closes the door
behind him. He joins Jerome at the curtain, and they move down the back
stairway to the CLUB–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I guess this is it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I guess so, M.D.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I think I’m going to be sick. Why does this
have to be happening to me? Has it crossed your mind that we’re about to
make the biggest mistake we’ve ever made?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I don’t think it’s all that bad.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: That’s why I do all the thinking.</p>
<p><strong>taste m.c.</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome
Vanity Six.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, God–</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: and Jerome are beside themselves with
happiness. The pull off their shades immediately, sit back and glow in
the audience’s response.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: stands in the back, his eyes glued to
Vanity. Her strength and sureness in front of the Crowd is breathtaking.
The audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone – as if another
wall has gone up between them. He looks away a moment and spots…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: watches the Girls bowing to thunderous
APPLAUSE. Suddenly Vanity looks at him and touches the earring she’s
wearing – it’s his Mother’s. His knees weaken instantly, and he locks
eyes with her. The heat between them is unmistakable. She smiles
vividly, gives him an endearing wave and steps back as the curtain
closes.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: and the Girls rush into the dressing room
and jump up and down with excitement. They are beside themselves with
happiness, kissing and hugging one another avidly. Suddenly Vanity pulls
away, indicates she will be back and cuts out the room.</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: as she runs down the hallway to the
backstage area, peers from behind the curtain, scanning the club
earnestly.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Morris is squeezing you, kiddo. You better
kick ass tomorrow night or else.</p>
<p><strong>backstage</strong>: as Vanity watches Prince leave. A
profound sadness sweeps her face. Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging
and kissing her happily. Brenda runs up, pouring champagne. Morris,
Jerome and The Time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her
excitedly into the room. Vanity forces a smile, goes down the hallway,
casting another look at the exit door.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Did you hear these people applauding? They
loved us – they wanted to rip us apart, and this is just our first
night. I can see it now, we’re all going to be big stars. I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ain’t nobody bad like me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Morris, you’re a genius.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ye-es…</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Let’s go, Bebe.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Huh, where’s Jerome?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: In his skin…hee, hee…</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Is he coming?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: I gave him the night off.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Oh, no – Oh, God…No!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Get on!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Motherfucker! You long-haired faggot!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: So here we are again. So this is it, huh?
What do you want this time?</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: What’s your problem now? What’s your main
problem?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No problem. I just wanted to talk, alright?
I just want us to be okay, to really get along. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No big deal, huh…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: No, definitely not. Who are you? You can’t
tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Please don’t drink that. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: If you put your hands on me like that ever
again, I’ll be the last person you touch.</p>
<p><strong>the driver</strong>: spots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on
his brakes! He SKIDS wildly across the road, comes to a SCREECHING,
BURNING stop inches from her thigh!</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: shoots a look at Prince, her lips trembling,
her love for him, written plainly on her face. But his eyes flash
defiantly. She bites her lip sadly, then snaps a hot look at the
Driver–</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I need a ride.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Dad…?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Mom…?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Daddd…!</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Lift!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: sits motionless a long time. Moonlight
floods the basement with a foreboding light. A dog BARKS somewhere in
the distance. He looks up suddenly, his face agitated, his eyes red from
tears.</p>
<p><strong>prince’s pov–</strong>: CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining
the body of his Father. There’s a GUN in his Father’s hand clearly
marked.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Noooooo!!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Cool, gray dawn. He’s in a dead sleep
on the floor, his arms outstretched, his legs twisted beneath him. His
Father’s outline seemingly rests by his side…</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Let’s bring them back! Ladies and gentlemen, The
Time!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You love us right?! You want us right?! I
can’t hear you!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: What time is it?! Whawhak!!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>band members</strong>: It’s all over now. He better watch
out. He doesn’t even need to go on. He might as well go home.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: How’s the family! Whawhak!</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p><strong>billy sparks</strong>: leans against the bar, a smug look on
his face.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: walks slowly up the stairs, gazes at
Prince.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: does not move. The APPLAUSE trickles away.
He continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his
Band, or start a tune. A nervous TWITTER ripples though the crowd. Those
who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him – but
no one turns away. Then his voice comes clear and mellifluous–</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I would like to do a song that two of my
friends wrote.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: is crying. Every moment she has shared with
him is expressed in this song, and the effect on her is unnerving. Her
heart leaps to him in a way she never thought possible. But she lets it
go willingly, as the words draw her in, seducing her somehow, making her
free…as if the music, his words, all that he has experienced and
understood, is purging what is confused and ugly within herself, leaving
her with an understanding and joy that burns in her womb like soft fire.
A smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow, and she finds
herself moving closer…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: is still running though, his face streaming
with tears, past the surprised look of Jill, past the FANS, past
everyone – stripping of his clothes fiercely, flinging off his jacket,
his shirt, his scarf–</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vanity</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: THUNDER! Prince walks center- stage…and bows.
The AUDIENCE goes BERSERK! He acknowledges Wendy and Lisa, and then the
entire Band. The CROWD is jumping out of their skin! He straps on his
guitar, gives a deft signal and–</p>
