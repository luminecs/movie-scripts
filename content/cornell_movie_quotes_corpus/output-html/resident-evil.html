<p><strong>george a. romero</strong>: &amp;</p>
<p><strong>the video</strong>: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS
darting frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Take it, Goliath. It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle
disappear over the hills.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Glad you’re still here, lady</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re awake.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’ve been awake. Since you left.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What, with my dinner? I never had a mother.
I’ll learn.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll do the cooking.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: There are probably all kinds of things
prowling around up there. In the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m sorry. Really. You…have to be there at
dawn. They ride the wind over the ridge.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Dawn? You left at one A.M.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I had to go fishing. It’s the fish that bring
them down, so I can get a close look at them. I’ve tracked a dozen of
them, Jill. Twelve of those big bruisers. I can actually recognize them.
I’ve even given them names, over the years.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’ve been doing this for years?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Only in the early Autumn. When they’re’
migrating.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’II set the alarm for next. October.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Beauty… isn’t simple. If it was… I’d be
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, no, no. I’m simple. You, on the other
hand……have all that… stuff… hiding underneath somewhere. That’s what
fascinates me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Fascination. Not love?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I… honestly don’t know. I guess I’ve been…
living alone too long. You’re the first, the only woman I’ve ever
thought of as… a real partner.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’ve always been…afraid of living alone. I’ve
always had… people… talking at me… knowing they could wind me up and I’d
do… … whatever they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m part Mohawk. Indians are never confused.
At least, they never let it show.</p>
<p><strong>ext farm dawn</strong>: The purple horizon is turning orange,
but it’s still quite dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the
creaking door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES out
into the morning breeze.</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin’ around. Get
in.</p>
<p><strong>a wide shot</strong>: of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS,
from two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at first, then
gaining speed… extraordinary SPEED. We are seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF…
whatever it is that’s running, charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY…</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: Top brass, sir!</p>
<p><strong>man with tattoo</strong>: Alpha Leader.</p>
<p><strong>man with tattoo</strong>: Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>man with ring</strong>: You’re good, soldier. But not that
good. It’s five hundred miles away. In the backwoods of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>man with ring</strong>: Very resourceful. You have my
permission activate them.</p>
<p><strong>man with tattoo</strong>: I’ve already done that. You have my
permission… to say that you gave me permission.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Valentine.</p>
<p><strong>disimone</strong>: Another practice run, right?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: We been practicin’ six months! For what?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: For this. This is the real deal.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Honest to God?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Based on my experience, Williams, God isn’t
always honest</p>
<p><strong>disimone</strong>: Where we goin’?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: If you had the jing to build a place like
this, would you build it in the middle of fuckin’ nowhere?</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Paris.</p>
<p><strong>disimone</strong>: Manhattan. Upper west.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Some people prefer… a quiet life. Our orders
are to secure the area.</p>
<p><strong>disimone</strong>: From what? This area’s been ‘secure’ since
the French and Indian War!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: This is Valentine, Bravo Team. We, er… we
might be in trouble, here.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Can you get a trace?</p>
<p><strong>laguardia</strong>: Lost the beacon. It just cut out. Like it
was…swallowed by something.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I do believe, gentlemen…that we’re gonna be
earning some combat pay.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Damn, if you don’t love a fight.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Hey, if I didn’t… you’d be a dead man. Call
in a nine- nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.</p>
<p><strong>bullhorn</strong>: There’s been an accident in the hills
nearby. A military aircraft, carrying live weapons, has crashed…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Let’s go, hayseed. You gonna be a good
boy?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Look here, I’m the Sheriff of this…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Step aside.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: But, I’m the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like
you.</p>
<p><strong>sherriff</strong>: That’s a worn-out scenario. If a plane
crashed nearby, don’t you think somebody would have heard it go down?
Tell us the truth, guys. What’s this really about?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I said, STEP ASIDE!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to Raccoon
City. Assist the e-vack. I’m going on target with Alpha Team. All forces
stand ready to support.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Aw, no… …L-Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: They… they come outta the trees, Reddy. Don’t…
don’t know what they was. Figure… maybe some kinda… wolves, or somethin’
…</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: I… I never seen ‘em comin’.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t try to talk, Rake.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I know. You… kept the place runnin’… better
than me.</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: I just…never seen ‘em comin’, Reddy. Never
even…had a chance to…turn a gun on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where are they going? There’s nothing in
there… except…</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: Y’oughta… remember it… real good. I do. From…
when you was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The… the old Arkley place?</p>
<p><strong>rake</strong>: I remember them days. I surely do… Remember
them… them old days.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing’s
still alive.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You’ll have to rotate or you’ll run out of
fuel, but I want one chopper to remain in the air at all times. We might
need help in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Holy… Goh… gaah…</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Aiken… a guy with a brain your size would
be better off dead.</p>
<p><strong>alken</strong>: I’ll pass. Shoot Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: ‘Valentine’. Radio Washington. Bravo Team
found on site. No survivors.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: We’re goin’ in. Watch your backs.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Who fired? WHO FIRED?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Let’s get inside.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Even-Steven, boss. You saved my ass in the
desert. I saved yours I in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I don’t believe in being… ‘Even- Steven’
with anybody. A man saves my ass…I pay him back. Before this day is
over, I’ll pay you back, Barry. Just… stick with me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Look here, man. I’d follow you into any kind
of enemy fire. But these things ain’t firin’ at us. They want us for
breakfast! When are you gonna tell us what the hell is goin’ on
here?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: When you need to know. Just do your job,
soldier. That’s what I’m doin’. My job.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Old. They probably don’t have cable.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: They probably don’t have radio.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Who’s they? Who’s place is this?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Guy named Arkley. Bootlegger. Built this old
fortress during prohibition. He figured nobody’d ever find him out here
in the back woods. Nobody did. Till he died. Feds have had it ever
since. Place has been here for eighty years… derelict… a safe-house.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: A safe-house… for who? For what?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: There’s a… a secret installation. Below. A
network of laboratories.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What kind of… laboratories?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: They didn’t issue us gas-masks, so I figure…
it’s okay to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Why send in a strike-force?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Yeah. What are we supposed to do? Polish
the silver?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Three men stay here. Chambers…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m not a man.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Rodriguez…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I’m better than a man.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Alright. you come with us. Aiken, Sullivan,
stick here with Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Why us?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: I dunno why me. You? I guess the C.O.
figures you’re as worthless as a dame, Aiken.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Relax. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That thing…tells you where to go?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: One man stays here. Ridley. You’re it. Shoot
to kill. Just make sure it’s not one of us. The rest of you… this
way.</p>
<p><strong>ridley</strong>: Who… who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>ridley</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who are YOU? What the hell is</p>
<p><strong>ridley</strong>: How’d you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who sealed the door?</p>
<p><strong>ridley</strong>: Who knew there a door?</p>
<p><strong>ridley</strong>: Who… who… ?</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Where’d that come from?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Back…where we just were.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Shit, man, we’re chasin’ our tails!</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s not what killed him. Blood’s still
running. Wounds are fresh. But look at his skin. This guy’s been dead
for a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: He was dead… before he was shot?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Ridley?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I… I’m one of the good guys, okay I’m just
trying to…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: SULLIVAN! AIKEN!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Forget him. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Somebody did some major remodeling.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We gotta get him out!</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: What? Smart fuckin’ plants?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: No big deal. Most-plants are smarter than
you, Aiken.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Why would anyone shoot a dead man?</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Lemme guess. Maybe ‘cause he was… walkin’
around?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Head-shot. We were sprayin’ those dogs
outside… but think about it. Were any of ’em brought down without a
head-shot.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I lost three me. You killed them, Wesker. You
did… and I did. Because I didn’t know what to expect… because you…
didn’t tell me!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Tell you what?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Anything! I wasn’t told anything!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Put down the gun.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Not until…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: How ya doin’ , Valentine? Good to see ya. Glad
you’re still alive. Same here, colonel, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: The same way those fuckin’ dogs got out!
Through their pens! I… locked them off.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Ladies first.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Maybe… they’re in the house. More of them
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Diameter’s too small. It… almost looks as
if… it was done by a…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: A human?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes, but… what kind of… human… would do
something like this?</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Not a vegetarian, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Aiken, you’d be better off…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: There was a guy. Not part of the team. And
there was… some kind of… plant… that seemed… alive.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Gimme a fuckin’ break.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: No shit. It disappeared… right into the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I guess it’s… time to spill it.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Speak English, hombre.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Marcus has been experimenting with an
artificial… man-made… virus. Coded…the ‘T’-virus. Financing came from a
private corporation, you may have heard the name… Umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They’re… multi-national. Huge.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: So huge that they have… connections… in high
places. That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This virus… it jumped, right?</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Shit! We’re all dead! We got the bug, and
we’re all dead!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: It’s not airborne. It was spread… in the
water supply. Lab animals and… the researchers themselves… passed it on…
by…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: By… biting.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You catch this virus and… what?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You die. But… not for long. The
chemical…revives the brain, and…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You stand back up… and chew on the first
guy you see.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Christ, this is like… Night of the Living
Dead!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why, in the name of Jesus, would anybody
wanna mess with shit… that does that shit?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Victory, friend. Civilization has come a
long way, but we still have… war. Imagine… a soldier who can’t die.
That… was the concept.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: But the virus… jumped.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Hopefully… if we got all the dogs… we’ve
contained it.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hopefully? Jesus… why didn’t you tell us?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: By telling you NOW, I’ve put your lives in
jeopardy. Nobody has this information. Except a few high-and- mightys.
Me. And now, you.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I don’t know, this all sounds pretty shaky
to me…</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Guess that proves it. A head-shot knocks
’em down.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Th-that man.. .was dead. I… I’m a doctor! I
should know! That man was dead!</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: I hope you have a lot of these.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the man’s HAND… flaking, decomposing. The
pen it holds is making only random, erratic marks.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Where the fuck is a shark’s brain?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: In it’s head! I swear, Aiken, you would be
better off dead.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You set off a
containment breach!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It must have been the water. God, the water!
Did you swallow any?</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: A bunch of us did, man.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Separate systems. Salt water. No germs.
But.. .it breached!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: So…we live here now.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: There are override exits… but I can’t find
them without THIS!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That was a smart move.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: And… you are?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nobody. Just a…a local guy…</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Valentine…who is this asshole?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: His name is Chris Redfield. He was… part of my
cover, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Cover?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: This is not the time to mouth off, Chris!
You’re in deep shit here!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why didn’t you let me in on this?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Why did you have to come after me? How did you
get in here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I used to play here, when this was a fucking
laundry room! And what makes you think I came after YOU?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Whoa! Look here.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: It…it once was.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
marked…blue and green.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: The greens are the overrides. Can you print
this out?</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: We have to get down to level ‘D’.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this mission was
about bringin’ him out, we’re outta here, right?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I wish we were, but no. We have a potential
outbreak here. We might be the only ones who can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Stop it? How?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: There’s… an antidote.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Not simple.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not complicated, either. We only have to
decide… what’s right… and what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I forgot. You’re never confused. So…what’s
right, Mohawk? And what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Shit. There are no green exits on this
level. Why… why would that be?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They don’t want anybody up here to go
snoopin’ …upstairs or down.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Pretty good guess. You must have been in the
military, son.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Native American. Exempted.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Fuck! There… there’s no way out!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes there is.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Not a bad idea. See if you can call up…
service charts, schematics.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders. The whole
infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Print it. Print all of it.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What’s that from?</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: I…snagged it. On the desk. When we were
scrambling.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Lemme look at it.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: No. It’s just a scratch!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There’s a… part of an old laundry chute. It
might not show on there. It runs up to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I’m not going up. I’m going down.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No objections. We’ll back you up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You said… people wind you up and you do
whatever they want you to do.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Stay out of this, son. You’re the only one
who doesn’t have a choice in this. There’s no place to lock you up. I
can’t let you go, you’re a security risk. I could shoot you. Legally.
But your lady-friend would probably get all over my ass. So… I’m afraid
you’re comin’ with us… whether you like it or not. He’s your
responsibility, Valentine. See that he doesn’t make trouble.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You up to the challenge?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I already have.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jill, I… I’m sorry. I’m just… angry. When I…
thought you were gone, I… Then… when I saw you. Alive. I realized
that…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That you were still… fascinated.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Stop. Stop!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I…I want to. I want… nothing more. But… I
can’t. When I’m in this uniform, I’m more than… just me. Try to
understand…there’s no “I” in Team, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There’s no “I” in DEAD, either.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You go. You’re not part of this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m part of it as. long as you are.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: For me, too, brother.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I mean this… It’s very uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Eighteen years?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that long if
they’ve seen action.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’ve seen action in Granada. And Desert
Storm. Would have lost it all there… if my buddy didn’t bring in a team,
against orders, to pull my ass out. Buddy named… Wesker.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’ve been with this asshole since… ?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Since before that. We were… kids together.
Macon, Georgia. He’s… only an asshole some of the time…</p>
<p><strong>up ahead</strong>: WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves
his troop on. They start to climb down.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Who knows what we’ll find down there?</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Think positive. The farther down we go, the
worse it’s gonna get. So… until we hit bottom, we’re in good shape…
relatively speaking.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Whatever it is.. .it can’t get us. We’re in
the ceiling!</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Maybe it’s like… really tall.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Aiken…</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Main-frame. Might have some data we could
use. Fox, Marini, Vickers. Down.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The man has balls, I’ll say that.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Hustle it, Vickers. You’re the guy we need.
To cut into the network.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Watch these entrances, guys.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: AAAAH ! Shit.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Hold tight. It doesn’t sound like it’s on
this level.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Shit. I’m locked out. Any clues for a
password?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Try… Umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Nothing. Wait. I’m into… No. No data. Just
some kind of video feed. Time-coded. Yesterday. It’s a play-back. Holy
shit!</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN
who is trying to protect her from…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Maybe the ceiling’s not such a safe place,
after all.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Scram! SCRAM!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Haul ass, boss!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: That’s…two I owe ya.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: One. We were all… ‘Even-Steven’ .</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Two. Remember? ‘Even-Steven’ … is not in my
vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Those things could get up here. We can’t let
that happen. This is our way out…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Caruso.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Any time. How do we get back UP?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shit, if you didn’t have a plan, you
shouldn’t have jumped down here.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: We have a real problem here, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How big is this place? How many people were
down here? How…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Big. Heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It got you!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No skin broken. I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We owe you a pair of pants.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Stand down. Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: I’m through, Wesker.</p>
<p><strong>marini</strong>: Me too, man. This ain’t nothin’ I signed on
for.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You want to wait here, fine.</p>
<p><strong>marini</strong>: Wait here? No. We’re gettin’ out!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You can’t. Not without this.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Fuck you! And your fancy doors and your
green key! The choppers have rockets. They can blow out a wall if they
have to. I’m callin’ ’em in.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You wanna see a wall blow, I’ll blow all of
’em for ya.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You…lunatic! That damn thing can slip out of
your ear by accident!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: That’s right. It’s your job…all of your
jobs…to see that it doesn’t. And to see that my heart… doesn’t skip any
beats.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Sumbitch might do it, Speyer.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I’II be obliged to do it! If I don’t get
that antidote, I’ll have to burn this place out! Valentine. The
radio.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are you, this guy’s flunky? He just
threatened to blow us all up, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to prevent!</p>
<p><strong>laguardia</strong>: How many digits did you receive?</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: Six. The beginning of an air- support
code, but… it just went dead on me.</p>
<p><strong>laguardia</strong>: Call S.T.A.R.S. in Washington. I
want…</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: Hold it…</p>
<p><strong>laguardia</strong>: Call Washington anyway. I want the
authority to take action if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>radio man</strong>: No independent action.</p>
<p><strong>laguardia</strong>: Damn. I feel so fuckin’… helpless!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: You guys were hand-picked. A Special Unit.
Most of you have been sitting on your asses, drawing pay checks for more
than two years. Well… it’s time to repay those… Government loans.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Bull shit. I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Pitch your empties. Put all your loaded
clips on that crate there. I want a count. Then I want the rounds
divvied up… evenly.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Lingerie. Notions.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have men dead
upstairs! This hell-hole is full of people who died… because of this
stinkin’ …BUG!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Forty two.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: That’s all we have?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: We weren’t expecting a war, Speyer. I’ll
take three. Three to your boyfriend…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t need ’em. Got my own loads.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Good. Then… we all get four clips.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: They must have… weapons down here,
somewhere. A powder magazine.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: No more side trips. It was a mistake to go
into that lab upstairs. My mistake. And I’m not makin’ another one. From
now on it’s straight ahead. In and out.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jill…this guy is a Loony-Toon.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: He’s just… trying to get the job done. Doing
what he has to do.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, well…I hope you’ll say the same about
me… when I do… what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: It’s not clear… which way to go.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Want me to flip a coin?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: What’s that sound like to you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This is the heart of the whole place. They’ve
got to have it… protected somehow.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: There’s no way outta this mousetrap!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: So we live here now?</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: We gotta run for it.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Bad idea, Speyer.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Down. Through these.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: Where do they go?</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: On three…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: One… two…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: God…and it doesn’t even stop them…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s not meant to stop them. It’s meant to
stop…something else.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: We damn near got turned into Rice Krispies
by that gizmo of yours. If you don’t want me to nail that fuckin’ thing
into your ear, you deactivate it. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I can’t. They.. .fixed it… so you can’t
chicken out. The system can only be turned off at the main panel.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Where the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Where the explosives are. Down… farther than
we need to go. We only have to make it down one more level. If… when… we
make it back up to the choppers… we can fly out of the detonator’s
signal range.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m not willing to rely on that. I live here,
this is my town!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: The town’s been evacuated. Just… just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That explains the lie. About the plane crash.
An airplane down… with weapons on board… would nicely explain a big
explosion, wouldn’t it? You figured all along you might have to blow
this place!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I don’t want to do it. I… I hope I don’t
have to.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I…I can’t let this happen. I’ve got to find
that bomb.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’ll help. Once Wesker gets what he wants, my
obligation is over.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. I want you out. With the rest of them.
Wesker won’t push the button until you’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: He doesn’t want to push the button.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He has to. Don’t you see? He can’t leave
these labs here. And, Jesus… walking corpses! He’s gotta get rid of the
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Chris, no!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ve got to try and stop this.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Shit. One thing after another.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Sit tight. Ride it out.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No. That way. Chris and the others…</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: If they’re dead, they’re dead. If they’re
alive, they’ll still be alive in twenty minutes. When we get back.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Maybe not. And how do we know it’s only going
to be twenty minutes? How do we know we’ll be able to come back this
way?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: We don’t. But we’ll do our damndest to try.
This is it, guys. The home stretch. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Th-this thing was no accident. It was
cultivated!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And it didn’t rip out the ceiling for the fun
of it. Stay alert.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: My mother made me eat vegetables. I know ’em
all. This ain’t one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Aiken…</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Get out of the away!</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: They.. .they killed Sullivan. The bastards…
whoever did this shit… they KILLED SULLIVAN!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>aiken</strong>: K-kill me. S-Sullvan said…I’d be.. .better
off dead. That…ain’t never been truer than now. Kill me!</p>
<p><strong>voice in the room</strong>: Anything you can’t handle?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Keep us appraised.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Right behind me. Were you… talking to
someone?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: To Washington. To my… superiors. They’re
your superiors too, Valentine. Don’t forget that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothin’. man. No doors. Nothin’. We hit a
dead end.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Us too. Cement wall.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: We’re never gonna get to that lab.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I… can’t take this any more.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We take what comes. That’s the secret of our
genius.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Not very old at all. Not nearly old enough
to…to…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: None of us is old enough for that.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Jill… told me… you were nice .</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She did? She never told me.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly.
It’s fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns… which PUNCH upward,
penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Head shots. Ain’t doin’ nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: That was the idea.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What idea?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: To win. The idea was… to win.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Wing it!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You know…that just might be the ticket. Wing
the fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>speyer</strong>: Run! We slowed ’em down. Run!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Where? As far as we’ll get, either way, is a
cement wall.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You lost a man. If I had only been faster. I
was unfamiliar with the mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s mindless. It doesn’t realize
that it’s strong enough to push the door open.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Hasn’t happened to me, yet.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: My… colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro. As far as we
know, we are the…only ones.. .left alive. We worked on “C” level. One of
the biologists saved us. Brought us down here. He knew that… he didn’t
have long to live. He… started the mechanism… out there, in the
corridor.. .and he let it… take him.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You did fine, lady. We’re obliged.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: As are we. We believed… we would die here.
Believed…the bomb would destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You knew.. .about the bomb?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The end for a place like this, when it fails…
must be a bomb, yes?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It… already came. ma’am. We brought it. The
colonel, here… he’s wearing it.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Is it true? Are you here to… rescue? Or
destroy?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Both. If I have to pick only one… I’ll pick
destroy.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You’re not S.T.A.R.S. You’re Umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Once again. Both. Two salaries. Three if you
count combat pay.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The man I loved, John Marcus… developed the
organism that caused all this. He… he did it for humanitarian purposes.
It was taken away from him…for in-human purposes…by men like you!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: No, ma’am. Men like me… are just errand
boys. Sent in to do the wet-work. All of the glory. None of the
benefits.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: After what you’ve seen down here, do you think
any of it could be turned into… benefit?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Yes. I think it could be turned into five or
ten million dollars. How do we get into “D” lab?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Death lab. John was killed…never even knowing
it existed. They kept him… isolated, upstairs, while a separate team was
down here…corrupting his research. Using it to build B.O.W.s.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: B.O.W.s?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Bio-organic weapons.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: The sharks. The plant.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Early experiments.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The snake.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: A failure. Its behavior remained reptilian. All
they could ever get it to do was… grow in size.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Those dogs. They were weapons.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No. They… simply became infected. As did…
everyone else. Janitors. The cook. Electricians. Guards. People who
believed they were serving their flag. Scientists. Great minds… turned
into mindless.. .ghouls!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Before the outbreak, the experiments went
further, didn’t they? Those… ceiling-crawlers out there.. .</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The product of human DNA spliced with the DNA
of vicious carnivores… animals, even insects. Plated with armor, beneath
newly cultivated skin. Then… injected with poison, so their biological
components would die.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Die.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The “T”-virus reactivates them in a matter of
minutes, but… in battle, lost minutes are… inconvenient. So, the B.O.W.s
had to die… and be allowed to revive before they could be used to… full
advantage. They were murdered… by their own people… so they could never
be murdered again… by the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Were any more of these…weapons…
developed?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: How fortunate… that I am.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Have…you been leaving doors open?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: This place is going to be overrun by…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Brad’s in really bad shape.</p>
<p><strong>vickers</strong>: One…of the sharks. Its teeth. I
Just…brushed up against its teeth…after it was dead.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Shoot him. Somebody, shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No! We’re so close. The antidote.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What’s got into you man? This… this isn’t
like you.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: You know how to use that thing,
chica?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Of course I do. I’m a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No! You can’t! Not while there’s still a
chance to save him!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: It’s called… the Tyrant. Nobody knows it
exists. Except us… and Holden.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Holden?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Umbrella’s man in D.C. We need him. He signs
the checks. We’ve got it, Barry! Our fortune!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You’re not gonna try to get this big mother
outta here ?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Don’t have to. All we need is the data.
Then.. .these things can be cranked out on an assembly line!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What about the antidote?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Antidote? There is no antidote. That was
just happy horse shit, to keep the team going.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You’re gonna give this to Umbrella?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: No. I’m gonna sell it to them. Then I’m
gonna open a Swiss bank account… right next to yours.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: It’s real, alright. And it’s worth… more
than gold. More than uranium!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Do we get a piece of that action?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: All of you do. Anyone who comes out of this
alive… gets a taste.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Anybody else see it my way?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You disgrace yourself!</p>
<p><strong>toshiro</strong>: I…I want to live.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And I was gonna try to disarm the bomb. This
place should be destroyed! It needs to be destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Gotcha, son. It’s only because of Valentine,
here, that I didn’t squeeze the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: If she’s on your side… she doesn’t mean shit
to me. And I don’t mean shit to her.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Chris, please. There’s only… one way to go,
here .</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: That’s right. My way!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes, sir. Your way!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You shoot. I shoot, boss.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: We believed in you. I believed in you. Boy,
was I a sucker.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Get out! Now! Or you never will!</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: So… we’ll live here! No. The landlord
looks like a sonuvabitch.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Everybody! OUT!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thirteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so help me
God, you’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Get going.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Not without…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Orders don’t mean shit any more, Wesker.
Especially when they come from sell-out bastards like you.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: B-buddy. You gotta get us out.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Not sure I know how, boss. Do you? Is there
some other…‘need-to-know’ secret for shutting down the Big Bopper,
here?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: No. It.. it can’t be shut down.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: The ultimate warrior. The ultimate soldier.
We’ll see. How it does against a couple of hard-ass career guys, like
you and me.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: The corridor outside… can be moved.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You won’t come out in the same place. But
you’ll find a freight loader that can be accessed with…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: …a blue key. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: No. Pot blue or green. Red.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Red… overrides green.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So… you could have unlocked “D” lab.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I was hoping it would never be un- locked
again. Go. I will see that this.. . … is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s destroyed. It’s worthless But you’re
not.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I helped develop it!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Unwittingly. They lied to you. They lied to
Marcus. They made you believe you were doing a good thing when it wasn’t
good at all. It was evil!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Stand up? Against powers that have… ruled the
world since before we were born? We will only be…eliminated. Or locked
away someplace else. I’d rather die here. Knowing that the virus has
died with me .</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What if it’s already spread? You’re the only
one…who knew anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: But, I… know so little.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: More than anyone else. You have… a
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: To a higher command. The highest.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s one helluva big pump.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: An implant.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: From what? A fuckin’ elephant?</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: Rhinoceros.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Shit. I figured you knew more than you were
telling.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: I told you, we don’t. W-we can’t. It’s
unstoppable!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: ADA’S face.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I don’t know if I can face this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Just get us upstairs. I’ll take care of it
from there.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Alright. Come.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Doors… were left open.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Step on.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t know if it’s gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Come on. I been waitin’ all day for
somthin. like this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re up.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: I’m havin’ too much fun. You got a lady.
I just got me. Anyway… I ain’t gonna die in this rat hole. I’ll make it.
Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Level “C”. Have your weapons ready.</p>
<p><strong>rodriguez</strong>: Whoop-de-doo.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Get under a desk, man. I’m gonna feed this
thing a pineapple.</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: NO! It might damage the system! I’ve got to
get this data!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Forget it. Bullets don’t work!</p>
<p><strong>wesker</strong>: They seem to work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Level “B”.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: We’re almost there. You’ll have to jump off.
The belt won’t stop.</p>
