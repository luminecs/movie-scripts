<h1 id="jennifer-s-body">jennifer-s-body</h1>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Every day, I get letters. I think I get
more letters than Santa Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined. I’m kind
of the shit.</p>
<p><strong>raymundo</strong>: Rec time in five minutes, Needy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Grassy-ass, Raymundo.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Sometimes the letters are from people
who say they’re praying for me. They tell me everything will be okay if
I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I say the words, but nothing
ever happens. Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off the cross.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Occasionally I get presents from
starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or
something. They think they can take me away from all this.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Like I’d really date some perverted
Chester with a hard-on for jailbait. I might be insane, but I’m not
desperate.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: A lot of people ask me if I’m sorry I
did it.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry I didn’t do it sooner.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Welcome to the Mental Olympics. They’re
big on recreation here. Supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions.
We’ve traded in our hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O bombs for double
dutch.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Even the cutters get in on the action
when they’re fully conscious.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Me? I’m just trying to stay
invisible.</p>
<p><strong>int. leech lake cafeteria - one hour later</strong>: The
freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast. They grab trays and
settle into noisy cliques. Needy selects a single toaster pastry from
the breakfast line and sits down, alone.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Personally, I think they’re trying to
wear us out. Keep us sluggish so there won’t be an uprising. Well, those
J.V. tactics won’t work against me. I’m a kicker. K-I- C-K-E-R. It even
says so on my chart.</p>
<p><strong>nutritionist</strong>: Just one Toastem, huh?</p>
<p>****: I like Toastems.</p>
<p><strong>nutritionist</strong>: That’s good. But I’m not sure a
Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. I’d
recommend more complex carbohydrates…</p>
<p><strong>int. “the hole” - same</strong>: Needy is tossed into
seclusion. Her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears. The heavy
door slams behind her, leaving only a shaft of light.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I wasn’t always this cracked. I used to
be normal– well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage
hormones. But after the killings began, I started to feel, I don’t know…
loose around the edges or something. I was coming undone like those
jeans I made in Home Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy Cline. Shredded
like moo-shu pork. Dead inside.</p>
<p><strong>cheesy song lyrics</strong>: “Through the trees, I will find
you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you,
we’ll meet again…”</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: God, I hate this fucking song.</p>
<p><strong>ext. devil’s kettle, mn - night</strong>: Devil’s Kettle is a
quiet farming community, surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes.
It’s the kind of town that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
stoplight.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: This is where it all went down. “Devil’s
Kettle” sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb
waterfall.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the falls - night</strong>: We see the titular falls,
surprisingly powerful, gushing over a rock face.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Well technically, it’s two waterfalls.
One of them is normal– it empties into a river basin. But the other one
goes into a hole. And it doesn’t come out. The scientist guys can’t
explain it. They’ve dropped all kinds of things down there–bouncy balls,
red dye, radioactive slime– but nothing ever surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Maybe it’s another dimension. Or, you
know, just really deep.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jennifer’s house - midnight</strong>: The sprawling
ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single FIRST FLOOR
WINDOW– Jennifer’s– still illuminated. There’s a chicken coop and a wire
livestock pen in the backyard. We’re definitely in deep north
country.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I’ve probably spent years of my life in
this house. Hundreds of sleepovers, thousands of aimless homework
sessions, a million phone calls. I’ve climbed through Jennifer’s window
so many times. But tonight, only one of us is going to come out.</p>
<p><strong>int. jennifer’s bedroom - same</strong>: JENNIFER CHECK lies
on her bed, fidgeting as she watches TV. She’s a girl of 16 with LONG,
MATTED HAIR and a thin, frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she
looks sick and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed,
Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair.
Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH FLAGS and
underwear.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Jennifer didn’t always look this rough.
Actually, she was the prettiest girl in Devil’s Kettle when she wasn’t
so…hungry.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: She hadn’t fed in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’ll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed
Chip! You goddamned monster! You…ZOMBITCH!</p>
<p>****: Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God, you’re
butch.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Know what this is for? Cutting boxes.</p>
<p><strong>cross out jennifer!</strong>: Jennifer gasps, staring at her
wounds in shock and disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of
silence. Suddenly, THE GIRLS’ BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their
figures entwined. Their bodies FALL, collapsing back onto the bed with a
thud.</p>
<p>****: My tit!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. check</strong>: Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God!
Oh my God!</p>
<p>****: Needy?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her?</p>
<p><strong>ext. jennifer check’s house - moments later</strong>: Three
police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged.
OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young COP, jogs authoritatively
toward the house. He shakes his head, dumbfounded.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Christ, Needy, what have you done?</p>
<p><strong>int. police squad car - dawn</strong>: Needy,
innocent-looking in PIGTAILS, is hustled into the back of the squad car.
Her clothes and face are smeared with blood. Officer Duda starts the
ignition. His partner, a hard- faced FEMALE COP, slides into the front
seat. Her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of
shellacked MALL BANGS.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Hi, Roman! How’s the Force treating you? I
like that jaunty cap. Blue like your balls.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: How could you do this, Needy?</p>
<p>****: You killed Jen– Jennifer– I mean, the victim. Are you on
something?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Everything’s going to be okay now. I
rule.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Shut your mouth back there!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Hey. Didn’t you used to baby-sit me in like
1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yeah. Gracie, right? Gracie. I really like
your hair, Gracie. How many cans of Salon Selectives did it take to
erect that monument?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Watch it, Puffy Combs. That’s police
brutality!</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: You’re one to talk about brutality,
Ms. Lesnicki. You’re looking at attempted murder.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Ugh, don’t say attempted. That sounds so JV.
Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me–
I’d know.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Let’s get our facts straight: I successfully
committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there. I fucking
destroyed that brat, OK? I, Needy Lesnicki, put a stop-payment on
Jennifer Check.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Why am I even in these cuffs? I just saved
every guy in this town from becoming Satan Chow. I’m a hero.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: She’s delirious.</p>
<p>****: This is going to be a circus.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: At least we’ve already got a
confession.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Confessions are for pussies. You’ve got a
declaration, Grace.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: God, I love this song.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: I know. And they’ve done so much for
this town.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: They’re way more than a band, really. They’re
heroes.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Wait, this is my favorite part…</p>
<p><strong>female cop and roman</strong>: “Through the trees, I will
find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you,
that you are home…”</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: So I killed her. Whatever. It won’t undo
anything. Three pulses– three lives– all stopped cold by adolescent
bloodlust. It’s hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer
and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing
more, nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Jesus, Chip..</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high - day</strong>: CHIP drums on the sidelines
of the Devil’s Kettle High basketball court. The stands are packed with
BORED STUDENTS for a pep rally. Chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful
drummer.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Chip couldn’t drum for shit. He only
knew “Land of a Thousand Dances” and the solo from “Wipeout.” Lucky for
him, the pep band gig wasn’t too demanding.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: If you can believe it, that’s Jennifer.
Yeah, the same girl I iced with the box-cutter. Only back then, we were
tight. Sisters, practically. People found it hard to believe that a babe
like Jennifer would associate with a dork like me. But we’d been the
Wonder Twins since we were practically preverbal. Sandbox love never
dies.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: You’re totally lesbigay.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What? She’s my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: You stare at her like you want to dry hump
her.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Like, hump her through pants.</p>
<p>****: Are you jealous?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Of what? That rich bitch?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: She’s not rich.</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high hallway - after school</strong>: Needy digs
through her locker, carefully selecting textbooks to take home. Jennifer
skips up to her, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hey, Monistat.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What’s up, Vagisil?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You and me are going out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Tonight? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Soft Shoulder are playing at the
Carousel.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And it’s all-ages, for once, which means I
won’t have to play Hello Titty with the door guy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What’s Soft Shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: They’re this indie band from the city. I
saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots
of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it’s the
weekend!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: It’s Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Thursday counts as the weekend in college.
And we’re going to be in college twenty-three months from now.
University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Please, please you’re a social
disease?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I have to study.</p>
<p>****: Boo! Cross out Needy!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Fine. What time is the show?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a
date with that guy who owns the ham store.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: He seems nice.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, Mom says he’s got a huge… heart. So huge he gave her a
recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - 8:45 a.m.</strong>: Needy is standing in
a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of
clothing.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: “Wear something cool” meant something
very specific in Jennifer-speak. It meant I couldn’t look like a nerd,
but I couldn’t upstage her either. I could expose my stomach, but never
cleavage. Tits were her trademark.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Those jeans are hella low. I can almost see
your front butt.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Chip, it’s a rock show. This is my rock
look.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I can see, like, your womb.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Why are you blowing me off for some dumb
concert, anyway? We were supposed to have Movie Night. I even rented
Orca. It’s like Jaws, except with a harmless whale.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see
this band. It’s extremely important to her.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I’ve never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which
one is Jennifer stalking?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: The lead singer, of course. Girls like her
don’t go out with drummers.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Thanks a lot!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No offense. I mean, she’d probably make an
exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Like Phil Collins.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Who’s Phil Collins?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Forget it. He’s seminal, but whatever…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he
could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But
Jennifer says he’s extra salty, so…</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that
secret language?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: “Salty” means beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Then you must be soy sauce, babe.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Jennifer’s here.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p>****: Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: That’s fucking weird.</p>
<p>****: I’d better hurry.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You always do what Jennifer tells you to
do.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: She’s my best friend, Chip. Remember? This
necklace is no joke.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - same</strong>: Jennifer is waiting in
the front hallway. She’s heavily made-up and dressed in a predictably
sexy outfit. She dangles a set of car keys in front of Needy and
CHIP.</p>
<p>****: Guess who’s got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring
and it’s all mine.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re lucky you get to ride with me to
the club in style!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, hi Chip. Do you like puppies?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I think you forgot, like, two buttons.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I think she remembered two buttons.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It smells like Thai food in here.</p>
<p>****: Have you guys been fucking?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’re gross!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, let’s go to the club.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: The Carousel is not a club.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Eat my ass, Chip. You’re just jello `cause
you’re not invited.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I’m not jello! That place is gross. Everyone
there has a mustache.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re totally jello! You’re lime green
jello and you can’t even admit it.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!</p>
<p><strong>int. the carousel - night</strong>: THE CAROUSEL is a
run-down tavern at the edge of town, the kind with NASCAR posters,
wobbly chairs and strands of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling.
It’s a busy night and the bar is teeming with locals. A bartender sells
a CASE OF BEER to a customer and passes it over the bar.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Chip was right. The Carousel is
definitely not a club. Clubs are for attractive people in populous urban
areas. Clubs have DJs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and
girls. All we have is a broken jukebox, a few domestic taps and the
Sticker Toilet.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - same</strong>: We see a lone, nasty-looking
TOILET covered in BAND</p>
<p><strong>back on needy:</strong>: Needy and Jennifer enter the bar.
Every guy in the joint stares at Jennifer, who snaps her “MINOR”
wristband distastefully.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God, I can’t wait until I’m old enough to
get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Peach schnapps are excellent. They even
taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hi Jennifer. You look nice.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What up, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He thinks he’s cute enough for me. No
wonder he’s in retard math.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Hey, it’s Ahmet from India. The foreign
exchange guy. He’s all by himself.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I can’t believe we traded a cute hockey
player for that.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: He seems okay. He’s got that cool elephant
statue in his locker.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do you think he’s circumcised? I always
wanted to try sea cucumber.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Ew!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: You’re smoking dicks now, Jen?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What? I like the Wides.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: I just bet you do. I should arrest you for
possession under the legal age.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Arrest me, pfft! You’re not even out of
the academy yet, Roman!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Two more months and I’m on the force for
real. Then I’ll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I want.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How will I wait that long?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Not here, babe. I gotta keep my nose
clean.</p>
<p>****: Look, there’s the band!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You can tell they’re from the city.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of
faygos.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You would think that. You’re such a
small-time Gomer. I wish we had more guys like that in Devil’s Kettle.
All stylish and shit.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: They look so– so cool.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come
on! It’ll be like Almost Famous! I’ll be Penny Lane and you can be the
other girl.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t be J.V., Needy. They’re just boys.
Morsels. We have all the power, don’t you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: These things are like smart bombs. Point
`em in the right direction and shit gets real.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hi. Um, we just really wanted to meet you
or something? I’m Jennifer Check and this is my friend.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m Nikolai Wolf, and this is my band.</p>
<p>****: Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I’ve heard you guys are super,
super good at playing your instruments.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I hope we can live up to such…high
praise.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Hey, if you don’t mind me asking, why did you
want to play all the way out here in Devil’s Kettle? You live in the
city, right?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah. But I think it’s so important to
connect with our fans in rural areas. Plus, the audiences in small towns
really appreciate us.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Can I show you my appreciation right
now?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Like, I’ll buy you a drink? I mean, I’ll
see if I can get you a drink. They make this great 9/11 tribute shooter?
It’s red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all
brownish.</p>
<p>****: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Dirk, what about her?</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Who, Training Bra Jones?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: No, the hot one. The one who just walked
away. She’s it, man. She’s exactly what we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: You’re sure she’s…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: She’s a kid. We’re in God’s country, man.
Everyone out here’s a fundie bible-banger. Of course she’s a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Dirk, we didn’t haul our asses out to this
corn palace for nothing!</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Fine. Okay. You know, I know I’m not “just the
bassist.” I’m a person who happens to play the bass guitar. And I would
like some respect…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What? Are you scared of rock stars
too?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about
it.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think the singer wants me.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Only because he thinks you’re a virgin. I
heard them talking.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah, right! I’m not even a
backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I
couldn’t even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a
bag of frozen peas.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do
innocent. I’ll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: He’s way too old for you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t cock-block me, Needy.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Good evening, Devil’s Lake.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Sorry. Anyway, we’re Soft Shoulder. And we
just want to make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I know where to go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. the carousel- continuous</strong>: Jennifer collapses in
Needy’s arms, coughing. Needy hugs her fiercely, almost romantically.
She cups Jennifer’s flushed face and looks into her eyes.</p>
<p>****: It’s so hot, Needy. I think I’m on fire. Oh God, I’m
burning!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’re okay, I promise. You got burned worse
when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Are you girls all right?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: We’re great. Maybe you should try to find
your band?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Those guys? They were the first ones out
the door. Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys. Frankly, I’m ashamed of
them.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: God, it feels like hell out here. Come and
hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place
down.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay…okay…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You’re in shock. Here, drink this. You’ll
feel better.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Aren’t you a little freaked out about this?
What about all your stuff? It’s probably melting, and when you get to
the next stop you’ll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! Nobody
likes that.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We’ll be able to afford new gear soon
enough. I have a feeling we’re gonna blow up.</p>
<p>****: I want to see your van. C’mon Needy, let’s go to the van.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let’s
just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with
extra Badger Sauce! Please? I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Needy, stop it. Just stop it!</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I watched her get into that van and I
knew something awful was going to happen. But for some reason, I felt
drawn toward them. Toward him. He was pale and twisted and evil, like
this petrified tree I saw when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>ext. petrified forest national park -</strong>: We see LITTLE
NEEDY, about five years old, staring up at a petrified tree in the
darkness, horrified yet compelled. The tree seems to stoop forward,
cracking…</p>
<p><strong>back on needy:</strong>: Needy’s face is fixed in the same
haunted expression. Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a
vicious smile. Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction,
away from the van and the fire.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s bedroom - 11:00 p.m.</strong>: Needy stumbles
into her bedroom, overwhelmed. Her clothes are smoke damaged and her
cheeks are sooty. She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials
CHIP’s number shakily.</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s bedroom - continuous</strong>: Chip’s bedroom is
pitch black until a cheap cell phone lights up under the covers
illuminating his sleeping form, clad only in jockey shorts.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Niedermeyer.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Thank God you’re there. I hoped you were
sleeping with your phone.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Jennifer’s gone. She ran off with that rock
band. And the Carousel burned down.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Like, burned down? To the ground? Is everyone
okay?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No. I think they’re mostly dead.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Shit. You’re okay, right?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: We went out the bathroom window. Everyone
else was trying to use the door. It was like a stampede. The people who
fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: There was all this screaming and popping,
like a million Black Cats all going off at once. And the smell…</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: This is real, right? This isn’t just, like,
some crazy dream like last time?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No! Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk
home. But Jennifer’s still with those creeps! They had one of those
white molester vans with no windows. The back was all blacked out.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags
with douchebag haircuts? People just burned to death. In our town!</p>
<p>****: Oh cheese and fries! Someone’s here. I’m alone, Chip. I’m
freaked out!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Where’s your mom?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Swing shift. Listen, I’ll call you in a
minute. Stay awake.</p>
<p>****: Holla back.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - continuous</strong>: Needy opens the
door. Nobody there. She slams the door, turns around and SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Um, Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p>****: J-Jen?</p>
<p>****: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Jennifer!</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high - the next morning</strong>: Moments before
the first morning bell. Needy is sitting at her desk in English class,
still visibly bruised from her scuffle with Jennifer the night before.
She looks like she hasn’t slept a wink. The mood is quiet and somber–
kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups.</p>
<p>****: I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight
their way out with a machete.</p>
<p><strong>other girl</strong>: Look, she’s not even moving.</p>
<p><strong>gossiping girl</strong>: It’s called Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Happy Friday!, D-bag!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You– you’re all right!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. Why wouldn’t I be?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You
had two black eyes and blood everywhere and…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Needy, you’re delusional. I got a little
banged up when you made me go out that window, but I’m fine.</p>
<p>****: We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in
flames!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You do have a tendency to overreact.
Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and
it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned
to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of
the people there didn’t make it out. It’s like, all over the news.
National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Anyone we know?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: We know everyone!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sucks to be them, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I don’t get it. What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What’s wrong with you? I mean, besides the
obvious surface flaws.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: There’s no way I dreamed it. No way.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Her blood was still under my nails. See,
I’d been up all night scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - dawn</strong>: We see Needy on her hands
and knees in the eerie blue light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently
scrubs blood and bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. The black,
spiny vomit repulses her, and she gags.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Work, you…twat! Swiff, darn it! Swiff!
Swiff!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t talk to yourself. It’s one of your
more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total
gaylords.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Eww, you need a mani bad. You’d better
find a Chinese chick to buff your situation!</p>
<p>****: Here comes Handi-Snack.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: I’m sure those of you who made it
here today have all heard the news. It’s a dark day for Devil’s Kettle,
a day we can never, ever forget.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: The administration here has decided
that today will be a unstructured day of support and remembrance. We’ve
lost nine precious students– including Ahmet from India– several
parents, and a teacher, Ms. Parrish.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No way! Parrish ate shit?</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: This tragedy is obviously beyond
anything we can measure. More than ever, we need to band together and
draw strength from each other.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: We can rise up. We can overcome
death.</p>
<p>****: Oh look, they’re united in grief. That’ll last.</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high hallway - after school</strong>: The
automated bell rings. Needy slings on her backpack and hurries over to
CHIP’s locker. He’s packing up a pair of drum mallets.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: No band practice today.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No anything today.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It’s surreal, right? I mean, when just one guy
dies in Devil’s Kettle, it’s like time stops. And now so many people are
dead, nobody knows when it’s okay to start again.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I feel guilty just breathing.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Word.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Chip, I need to tell you something kind of
weird. It’s about Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You know last night when we were talking and
someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn’t talk. She
just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked
like she’d been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: And then she barfed up this disgusting
prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed
together.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom
makes with the rice sticking out?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yeah, like almost that bad!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It was probably because she inhaled a whole
bunch of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No. It was something evil.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You might want to talk to the school shrink,
Needy. I’m not saying that to be a dillhole. I’m actually kinda
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Chip, I’m a National Merit Scholar. I don’t
tell whoppers and I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I didn’t say you were crazy. It’s just that
everyone’s a little messed up about this. It’s okay to feel…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Discombobulated?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Yeah, you know. Fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hi Needy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh. Hi, Colin.</p>
<p>****: I heard you were there last night. In the fiery trenches.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Well, I’m glad you made it out. Really.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: How are you friends with Colin Gray? I thought
Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I just am. We have Composition together. He’s
a really good writer. You know– he’s so dark and emotional and all.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Oh. I can relate. I’m also like that, even if
I’m not all obvious about it like a poseur.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Walk me home?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kettle high football field - continuous</strong>: JONAS
KOZELLE, the JOCK we saw sobbing earlier, is standing at the deserted
football field.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s a gray, overcast fall day and the
wind whistles eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good
a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone. In the distance, a
tiny figure slowly approaches, It starts a dot on the horizon. As it
draws closer, we see it’s JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie
and unmistakable. Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder,
indifferent. A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely, Jennifer
ISN’T THERE. Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas’s left side, startling
him.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p>****: Oh. Hey, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m crazy-sorry about your profound loss.
You are crying about Craig, right?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: He was my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I know. I was close to him too. You know,
I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes
before the fire broke out.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You– you did?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. I was probably the last person to
talk to him. Like, ever. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Wow. What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, we got to talking about you,
actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother
to him. Not a bro. An actual brother.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I just can’t believe he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p>****: Hey, you know what else Craig said?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Forget it. It’s too intense.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: What? Please, Jen, you’ve gotta tell me!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, he said he always thought you and me
would make a totally bangin’ couple. Isn’t that so weird?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: He said bangin’?</p>
<p>****: Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Mine too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come with me. Just for a while. We’ll help
each other get through this nightmare. It’s what Craig would have
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>ext. residential street - continuous</strong>: Needy and Chip
are walking home from school, still deep in discussion.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: The whole night must be a total blur,
right?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: That’s the thing, it’s not a blur at all! I
remember everything, in like ultra-high-def detail. The band, the fire,
everything. Especially what happened after.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: “After” is the part I don’t really get, to be
honest.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Please, I need someone to believe me.
Jennifer was– she was destroyed. She was dying in my hallway, Chip. I
saw. I used my CPR training to check her pulse. And I felt her dying, on
the inside, I mean. I’ve known her so long that it’s like sometimes I
can feel what she feels. We’re like E.T. and Elliot Ness.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Thanks, Chipper.</p>
<p><strong>int. woods surrounding school - continuous</strong>: Jennifer
and Jonas are in the woods. Jennifer efficiently whips off her top and
bra and begins kissing Jonas hungrily. As Jonas touches her, he
recoils.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You feel so warm. Why are you so warm?</p>
<p>****: Shutties!</p>
<p>****: Jennifer! Jen…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Mm-hmm. They’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Uh, okay…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do you miss Craig?</p>
<p>****: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t worry. You’re going to see your
buddy again.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You mean like in heaven someday?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: God, they’re feeling so much
pain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Let it all out, kids.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - kitchen - continuous</strong>: Needy is
preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen. Needy’s
ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across the cracked floor. Needy scrapes the
sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Fried bologna is the bomb! You want some,
Greedo?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Something’s wrong…</p>
<p><strong>radio dj</strong>: That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who
became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil’s Kettle last night.
Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno,
risking their own lives in the process. That’s rock n’ roll with a
conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that
one…</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Virgin Mother!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Crap!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You said it.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh, hi, Mom. I didn’t know you were
awake.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I just had one of my night terrors.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: It’s four o’ clock, so technically you had a
day terror.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Right, right. I’m all mixed up since I started
working swing again.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What did you dream about?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail
me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: They were trying to get to you too, but I
wouldn’t let `em. I’m a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear.</p>
<p>****: Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s like, don’t y’all touch my daughter. I’ll
piss on you like Calvin.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You know, I can take care of myself, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: That’s what you think. One of these days
you’re gonna be crying out for me and I might not be there.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the
news after you clocked out this morning?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: No. I just did my scratch tickets, snorted a
few Lunesta and went straight to bed. Is something going on?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Nothing. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Don’t nothing happen in Devil’s Kettle.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Anita, that ferret stinks. He needs to be
washed from craw to cornhole.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kettle high campus - early evening</strong>: A
hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight. The sun has begun to set. An
ambulance and four police cars have pulled up near the woods, which are
cordoned off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS’S PARENTS
are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating the ground with her
fists. A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance. OFFICER WARZAK
exits one of the police cruisers. Her signature giant poofy bangs are in
full effect. She rushes to comfort Jonas’s bereaved mother.</p>
<p><strong>officer warzak</strong>: We will get the man that did this to
your son. You hear me? We’ll get that sick M.F.</p>
<p><strong>jonas’s dad</strong>: I’ll get him myself! I will! You hear
me, you bastard? I’ll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door! Like
one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got! That’ll be your
balls!</p>
<p><strong>ext. across the lake - continuous</strong>: The sound of
Jonas’s parents screaming carries across the lake. The water is eerily
calm.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s room - evening</strong>: Needy is sitting at her
lamp-lit desk, reading an old E.C. horror comic and eating a banana. The
phone rings. Needy picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Needy speaking.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I feel sooo scrumptious!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for
the first time and your whole body feels like it’s on vibrate.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s that good.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Lucky you. See, I’m still kind of depressed
about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of
town?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Move-on dot org, Needy! It’s over. Life’s
too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: That’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I tell it like it is. Besides, you should
be happy for me. I’m having the best day since, like Jesus invented the
calendar.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Jesus didn’t invent the calendar.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: That’s my other line.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So blow it off.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: It’ll just be a second.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Pooh. I’m crossing you out.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I need to see you right now.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I can barely hear you.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Camille is playing piano. Knock it off,
Camille!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Can you meet me at McCullum in ten?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You knock it off, Chip! You’re penis
cheese!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What could possibly be more important than
me and my godlike powers?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell
me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What’s the story down
there?</p>
<p>****: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mc cullum park - fourteen minutes later</strong>: The
park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a popular clandestine
meeting spot for the youth of Devil’s Kettle. The abandoned sand
volleyball pits are full of couples making out. Needy runs past them
skittishly. As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed, silhouetted
against a backdrop of twirling police lights. Needy squints at the
lights, sees CHIP’s house in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Why are the cops at your house?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: They’re not. They’re at Jonas Kozelle’s house.
He got murdered.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What?! Like, he was shot by gangbangers?</p>
<p>****: No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin’ on dubs around here?</p>
<p>****: Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the
school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him– on the body.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Some animals must’ve got to him.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Human teethmarks.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Who would do that?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I don’t know. It just happened after school.
No one’s supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to
the cops. Jonas’s mom is catatonic. She’s just staring out the front
window like a zombie mannequin robot statue.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: This can’t be a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What do you mean, Needy?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: A fiery death trap last night, and now a
cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Don’t get spooky on me, babe.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Seriously Chip. Most small towns only have
something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. Devil’s Kettle
gets two nightmares in 24 hours? It’s freaktarded. It’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What, do you think it’s, like
supernatural?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I don’t know. I’m extremely intelligent but I
obviously don’t know everything.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Well, the bad luck’s gotta be over now, right?
It can’t get any worse, right? Obviously it can’t. It can’t. I mean, you
agree, right? There won’t be another victim.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’re shaking.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I’m cold. It’s very cold out here.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Want my sweater?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It’s pink.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink.</p>
<p><strong>a series of newspaper headlines</strong>: The familiar Soft
Shoulder ballad plays as we see a dreamy montage of headlines. The
headline of the Devil’s Kettle Sun-Post simply reads:</p>
<p><strong>“why?”</strong>: The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune
reads:</p>
<p><strong>“‘butchered’</strong>: Devil’s Kettle youth brutally murdered
in wake of devastating fire.”</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: We were famous. We were saints. Our
town’s only bar had burned to the ground and our star quarterback was
somebody’s Quarter Pounder. The whole country got a huge tragedy boner
for Devil’s Kettle. And the press– God, they couldn’t get enough of our
little world of shit.</p>
<p>****: Through the trees, I will find you…</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: The days marched on as usual, but most
of us were too numb to enjoy ourselves. Most of us.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Still, we were healing. Like CHIP, we
figured things could only get better. We had faith.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: We were fucking idiots.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kettle high campus - to establish</strong>: It’s late
September. Leaves are beginning to drift off trees. The surrounding
woods are still blocked off with yellow police tape.</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high - morning</strong>: Mr. Wroblewski stands
solemnly in front of the class, his mechanical hand tensing and
releasing nervously. Needy and the rest of the class fidget.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Before the period ends, I have an
announcement.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: As you know, this is the one month
anniversary of the Carousel fire and also the murder of Jonas
Kozelle…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Bo-ring!</p>
<p>****: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin is
breaking out. My hair is dull and lifeless. God, it’s like I’m one of
the normal girls!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Are you PMS-ing or something?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: PMS isn’t real, Needy. It was invented by
the boy-run media to make us seem crazy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: …As I was saying, Needy and
Jennifer, I finally have some good news to share with all of you. The
members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping
hand to our community.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: As you know, their song “Through the
Trees” has become our unofficial anthem of unity and healing. So,
they’ve decided to release it as a benefit single.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: 3% of the profits will go to local
families who have been affected by loss.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What about the other 97%?</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: The other 97%. I mean, that’s just crass.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Crass. It means scummy. Greedy. Am I the only
one who actually does the vocab drills?</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Soft Shoulder are American heroes.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No, they’re not. I was there, Chastity. They
didn’t actually help anyone escape the fire. I don’t even know how that
rumor got started.</p>
<p><strong>chastity</strong>: Rumor?! RUMOR? It’s true! It’s on their
Wikipedia page!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh, that’s crap…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: They’ve milked our pain– our loss- - to get a
stupid record deal! No one would even know who they were if they hadn’t
been playing here that night. They used us.</p>
<p>****: You take that back, Needy Lesnicki! We need them now more then
ever!</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m already sick of that song.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. It’s poorly produced. Could the bass
be any lower in the mix?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is
everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m fine. It’s just, like, wearing off or
something.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What’s wearing off?</p>
<p>****: Are you on pot?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No, dick ridge! Just forget I said
anything.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>****: Hi, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio
lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you
something.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh. You want to know if I’ll go out with
you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No! Well– yeah.</p>
<p>****: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Just go ahead with the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Well, we’ve been having a lot of fun in
class, you and I, and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or
something. There’s a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next
weekend…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t like boxing movies.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It’s not…fuck it. Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why don’t you just come by my place
tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It’s about this girl who’s like,
half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Oh. Great! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ll text you my address.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: That was random.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m used to guys asking me out.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Colin’s a really nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He’s into maggot-rock. He wears nail
polish.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>****: Hi Chip.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I gotta go parlez French. Slam you
later.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No. He was just asking Jennifer out on a
date.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Can I come over tonight?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Sure. I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I went to Super Target and bought more
condoms.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Not that that has anything to do with my
coming over.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I didn’t assume that.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Well, I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>close on phone:</strong>: The TEXT MESSAGE reads: “trn lft on
camerford and your there. first house on rt. 1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo
jen”</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s bedroom - same</strong>: Needy and CHIP are
kissing on Chip’s water bed. Chip fumbles for one of those “fragrance
plug-ins” and PLUGS it into the wall. Needy looks over.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: For ambiance. It’s Jammin’ Jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you’re
interested.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No, this is nice.</p>
<p><strong>int. 1004 camerford - same</strong>: Colin enters the house
tentatively. It’s dark, vacant, and very creepy. There’s a very faint
glow and soft music coming from upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yo?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Jennifer? Anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s bedroom - same</strong>: Needy has eased off her
top to reveal an endearingly plain white bra, complete with center bow.
CHIP, also shirtless, cops a feel. He reaches into his pocket and pulls
out a fluorescent orange CONDOM. Needy looks at the wrapper.</p>
<p>****: “Sensual Swirl?”</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It’s supposed to make it feel good for the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>int. 1004 camerford - continuous</strong>: Colin follows the
music into an empty bedroom. The dark room is filled with blazing
candles melting and pooling into bizarre shapes. A single BLANKET is
spread out on the floor. Colin shivers. Behind him, in the doorway,
Jennifer appears, her smiling face hellishly aglow.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You made it.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What’s going on? This isn’t really your
house, is it?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No baby. This is our house, just for you
and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Do you even know my last name?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Silly. I’ve been sending you signals all
year. Couldn’t you tell? You give me such a wettie.</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s bedroom - same</strong>: Chip fumbles below his
waist, obviously struggling with the condom. Needy leans forward for a
closer look.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh. It’s got little bumps on it. I can hardly
wait.</p>
<p><strong>int. 1004 camerford - same</strong>: Jennifer grips Colin’s
face in her hands and forcibly kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs,
but stiffly. We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away instinctively
and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the walls, skittering over
surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Jennifer…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You scared? I thought boys like you were
into vermin.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Nice hardware, Ace.</p>
<p>****: No way…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, don’t you dare pass out! I need you to
be conscious.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I need you frightened.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I need you hopeless.</p>
<p>****: Hopeless..hopeless…</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What? Am I hurting you?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Am I too big?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Needy! What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>int. 1004 camerford - same</strong>: We can still hear Colin
making inhuman sounds of pain. We can only see the carnage in shadow,
but it’s clearly unspeakable.</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s bedroom - continuous</strong>: Needy clutches her
throat, hyperventilating. She stands up and struggles to get dressed.
Her breath rasps. Chip is freaking out.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Is it something I did?</p>
<p>****: It’s her.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Do you need more foreplay?</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s house - same</strong>: Needy races toward the
door with Chip in pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Needy!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I have to go. I’m sorry. I just… feel like
something…something terrible…</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You feel– What does that even mean? I’m
worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m so sorry, Chip. I’m so sorry. Everything
is just wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ext. chip’s street - same</strong>: Needy runs toward her
mom’s CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on the curb. She climbs into the car and
starts the ignition, trembling and crying.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!</p>
<p><strong>radio dj</strong>: That was, of course, Soft Shoulder.
They’re going to be playing a benefit concert in Devil’s Kettle next
month. Talk about giving back to the community! Generous guys, I tell
ya…</p>
<p><strong>ext. needy’s house - minutes later</strong>: Needy throws the
car into park and races up the front walk. She unlocks the door, shaking
and fumbling. She bursts into the darkened house.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Mommy! Mommy? Please be home!</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I’ve always been able to feel what she
feels. Just not like this.</p>
<p><strong>little jennifer</strong>: I’ll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you
be her.</p>
<p><strong>little needy</strong>: Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?</p>
<p><strong>little jennifer</strong>: You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken.
Choose.</p>
<p><strong>little needy</strong>: What’s wrong, Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>owwwwww!</strong>: Damn! Ass!</p>
<p><strong>little needy</strong>: Better. We should get a Band-Aid
though.</p>
<p><strong>little jennifer</strong>: We’re sisters now, you know.</p>
<p><strong>little jennifer</strong>: Don’t tell my mom about this.
She’ll make me get a shot.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I never tell on you.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen -</strong>: Needy WAKES UP in a cold sweat,
gasping. She’s still on the kitchen floor. She peels herself up off the
floor, disoriented.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s house - continuous</strong>: Needy trudges into
her dark bedroom. She strips off her clothes and stumbles into bed.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer’s voice</strong>: What’s up, Monistat?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God, enough screaming already. You’re such
a cliche.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: But we always share your bed when we have
slumber parties.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What the fuck is happening?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Whoa. I have never heard you drop the
F-bomb before. What’s buggin’?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I saw you! I saw you! The car…the…I…</p>
<p>****: Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m calling the police.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Go ahead, narc me out. I’ve got the cops
in my back pocket. I’m fucking a cadet, remember?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I want to explain some things to you.
You’ve already seen too much and besides– best friends don’t keep
secrets. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Remember the night of the fire?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yeah, it rings a bell.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost
died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They’re
basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as
soon as I got into their molester van.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Guys? Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Shut your mouth, object.</p>
<p>****: Nikolai…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are you guys rapists?!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You wish.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Hey guys? Do we even know if she’s a
virgin?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yes…yes! Of course I’m a virgin! I’ve
never done sex ever. I don’t even know how. So maybe you should find
some other girl who does. Know how.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.</p>
<p>****: Sure, man.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s bedroom - night</strong>: Needy is still
cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated by the tale in progress.
Jennifer is reclining in the bed with a relaxed, supernatural glow.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What did they do to you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Just let me finish. So they drove all the
way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so
dark out there…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We got a waxing moon. Perfection.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You’re the man, Wolf.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: I don’t know if we should go through with
this.</p>
<p>****: Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5?
Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser?</p>
<p>****: Maroon 5.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual!
God.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What? I found it on Google.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We come here tonight to sacrifice the body
of…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: …this chick from Devil’s Kettle.</p>
<p>****: My name is Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: That’s fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Please let me go. I’ll do anything.
Anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I only hump nines and tens. You’re a seven
at best, even with the chicken cutlets.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m gonna carve you like a pumpkin, bitch.
Don’t you know that me and my boys are in league with the Beast
himself?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We’ve spent months making offerings to the
“man downstairs,” and whaddya know? Satan delivered! We went from
college radio to being courted by the majors in two months.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: But that’s not enough, Jenny. We want
designer drugs. We want groupies that have their own groupies. We want
speedballs and stadium tours and Skittles sorted by color. In short, we
want more. And to get more, we have to butcher you. And bleed you.</p>
<p>****: Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or
something. Hey, I could be on your street team!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Sorry, darling.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Please…</p>
<p>****: Start chanting, boys.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: With deepest malice, we deliver this virgin
unto thee.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: It’s a bowie knife.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Bowie. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: “There’s a starman waiting in the sky…”</p>
<p><strong>band</strong>: “He’d really like to meet us, but he thinks
he’d blow our minds…”</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s bedroom - continuous</strong>: Needy’s
expression is both incredulous and horrified. Jennifer is totally
matter-of-fact. She picks at her nails with a wooden cuticle stick from
Needy’s night stand.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Being tortured would make most girls black
out or something. But I’m so hard core, I was with them the whole time.
I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right
through my heart.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: They…killed you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I mean, yeah. They went Benihana on my
ass. It should have killed me. But for some reason, it didn’t.</p>
<p>****: Maybe it did.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Whatever. Anyway, I don’t really remember
what happened after that. I just– woke up a few hours later and found my
way back, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I couldn’t bring myself to hurt you. I
mean, I’m a really good friend. But I felt so hungry. I had to do
something.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Ahmet. You made it out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are you lost?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Does your host family know you’re
alive?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Does anyone know you’re alive?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come with me. We’ll sort this out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Ever since then, I just somehow knew what
I needed to do to be strong. And when I’m full–like I am right now–I’m
like, immortal! I can do stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No biggie. Watch.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s some X-Men shit, right?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What do you mean, “when you’re full”?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know. Full. Like full of tasty
morsels.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Forget it. You’d probably tell on me
anyway. Not that anyone would believe you. You always think the world is
coming to an end.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What about my mom’s Kia? Why did you attack
me out there? Why were you covered in blood? You didn’t even look
human.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You should talk to someone about these
disturbing thoughts you’re having. We’re all concerned. Especially Chip.
I think he’s having second thoughts about you.</p>
<p>****: Leave!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: My, aren’t we a C-U-Next-Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come on. Let me stay the night. We can
play “boyfriend/girlfriend” like we used to.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You said to leave. So I’m outtie-
5000.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: See you at school.</p>
<p><strong>ext. our lady of perpetual blood cemetery - day</strong>:
We’re in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel path runs
through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is
taking place.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We gather here today to celebrate the life
of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What is this disturbance?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: These are Colin’s friends.</p>
<p><strong>goth boy</strong>: Colin! Take me with you! I belong down
there! In the DAAAARKNESS!</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: No, Kevin. Those are just his fleshly
remains. He’s among the dark angels of the realm now. Fly, Colin. Fly
into the firmament.</p>
<p><strong>goth boy</strong>: Is it cool if we camp here for a few days?
We want to commune with his corpse. He was our spooky homeboy.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Children, this is a private service for
family only.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Oh, right. I need to ask you something,
Mrs. Gray. It’s really important for me to have closure.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Young lady, have some respect for this
family…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gray</strong>: No. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Is it true that Colin had a date with
Jennifer Check the night he was killed?</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Because Jennifer Check is a social
disease. She’s not like us. She thinks she’s so special just because
she’s popular and and is what “society” considers “attractive.” But
she’s not sincere. She’s about as emo as a breast implant! And she
listens to Jessica Simpson and shops at Hollister. And I just know Colin
would never go out with someone like that, and I just need confirmation.
From you. So did he?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Did he…?</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Have a date with Jennifer Check.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Oh God. Oh God. I knew it! That BITCH! I
will erase her! I’ll put a freaky Druid spell on her!</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: I’ll spell her preppy ass right into the
ground!</p>
<p><strong>goth boy</strong>: Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad at the
person who murdered Colin. All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to
watch Aquamarine.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: That’s WORSE!</p>
<p><strong>goth boy</strong>: Colin wouldn’t have liked this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gray</strong>: Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah, you’re
right! I’m pretty sure my son wouldn’t have liked being eaten by a
fucking CANNIBAL and buried before his eighteenth birthday! Wow, you
must have known him so well!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Jill…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gray</strong>: By the time they found Colin in that
godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I’d know– I had to
identify the remains. My boy’s not in the realm of the undead. He’s not
flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. He’s in an
overpriced rosewood box that’s headed six feet downtown.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gray</strong>: So you can take your pain and shove it up
your asses, kids. I got the monopoly on pain!</p>
<p><strong>ext. kettle high campus - day</strong>: Two girls are hanging
an homemade banner on the fence surrounding the football field. It says
“TURNABOUT DANCE</p>
<p><strong>october 5 – tickets on sale.”</strong>: Needy walks briskly
toward school, huddled in her parka. She looks totally fucked up, like
she hasn’t slept in days. There are hollows beneath her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: They did a big memorial assembly for
Colin at school, and we had to watch another presentation about curfews
and the buddy system and how to deal with grief. But nobody seemed to
care anymore. Sorrow was last week’s emotion.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Jennifer and I hadn’t spoken since our
encounter in my room. Actually, I hadn’t really spoken to anyone. I was
busy with research. Paranormal research.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet? I
don’t get paid until next week.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I gotta show you something.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Not here. Behind the school.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Evidence.</p>
<p>****: Is this about Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing
I need to show y–</p>
<p>****: Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I
made love to for four minutes the other night. And I’m scared of what’s
happening to you. You’re acting really fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Please just let me show you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kettle high campus - continuous</strong>: Needy and Chip
walk to an alley behind the school. Melting snow drips off the eaves.
Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It’s full of copies
from the library and Internet printouts. The spine reads “JENNIFER
RESEARCH”</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p>****: Demon…demonic…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Demonic transference. It’s something that
happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an
actual virgin!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I think that’s what happened to Jennifer.
Those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods. But
what they didn’t realize is that she hasn’t been a virgin since junior
high! Jennifer’s a total cum-dumpster! It all makes sense now! Read
this…</p>
<p>****: “If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be
attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. She
must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon.” See?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: She’s eating boys! They make her strong.
Really strong. And when she’s hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her
hair is all full of split ends. And look at this…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: It says that before the demon feeds, it
vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. Like I saw!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You–you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and
Colin?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: And possibly Ahmet from India.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Really? You think she ate those guys?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No. No! Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No…Listen, I’ll make an appointment with
Mr. Feely. I’m real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage
paranoia.</p>
<p>****: My hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are
erratic…</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It’s all right, Needy.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: This has been a crummy school year, Chip.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Listen, I’m done with all that devil stuff.
Do you know what you’re wearing to Turnabout?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a
boutonniere, right here.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I was so in love with him. I didn’t want
to mess it up with my infectious crazy. Only I wasn’t actually crazy.
Everyone else was crazy. But when you’re the only sane one, you might as
well be crazy. It’s subjective, you know?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to
order your wrist corsage.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: How about magenta? You’re definitely a winter.
My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or
possibly teal.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh yeah, your mom’s an Avon lady.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Well, they call them “sales reps” now.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Right. Well, I’ll try to find something
magenta.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: That’ll look dope.</p>
<p><strong>evening</strong>: A group of student council kids are putting
the finishing touches on the dance decorations. The theme is “Through
the Trees” and there are papier mache trees everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s bedroom - evening</strong>: Needy stands in
front of a full-length mirror, wearing a big `80s-style magenta prom
dress. It sags on her flat chest and looks ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I look pork stupid.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: No, you’ve got that tiny waist, like a fashion
model. I always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Who’s Cindy Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: One of the great beauties of our time. She’s
even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Ow! You’re too close to my neck.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just
tell everyone I burned you.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Gross, Mom. Chip isn’t that ostentatious.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Now that’s a word you don’t hear every day.
Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: What are you doing to my hair?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Hooker helmet.</p>
<p>****: Aw, jeez Mom!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: If you can’t have big what-nots, you might as
well have big hair!</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s house - evening</strong>: Chip is standing in
underwear and black dress socks, taking his suit out of the closet.
Suddenly, there’s a loud KNOCK on the door.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I’m in underpants, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: I need to give you something.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Ladies’ pepper spray?</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: I’ve been thinking about it for a while,
and I think you need to be carrying this. There’s obviously a sicko out
there who likes boys. Boys your age. And I don’t want you going out
there unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I can take care of myself. I’ve been using the
Bowflex.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Did you hear what Colin Gray looked like
when they found him?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Lasagna with teeth?</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: You heard. So unless you want to wind up
looking like another exotic Eye-talian dish, take Mommy’s rape
spray.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Are you picking Needy up at her
house?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Meeting her at the dance. I’m gonna walk. It’s
so warm outside. It’s like 40.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: I want pictures with your sister before
you go.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: One more. Back to back. Big smiles.
Camille, we don’t touch ourselves down there. That’s our lady
garden.</p>
<p><strong>int. kettle high gymnasium - night</strong>: The gym is
decorated to look like an enchanted forest. A large banner reads
“Through the Trees- Turnabout Dance” There are streamers and balloons
everywhere in sickly shades of green and purple.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: This is my heart.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: My soul.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: Everything I once believed in.</p>
<p>****: Your abortion.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl #2</strong>: Your other abortion.</p>
<p><strong>goth girl</strong>: I hate your guts, Madison.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mc cullum park - continuous</strong>: Chip is cutting
through the park on his way to the dance. He whistles to himself. Across
the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him. The dog pants
aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but looks uncomfortable. A few
SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously at him.</p>
<p><strong>int. devil’s kettle high gymnasium - continuous</strong>:
Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the dance floor.
Needy watches them longingly. She checks her Mickey Mouse watch.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mc cullum park - continuous</strong>: Chip picks up the
pace, jogging down the path. In the distance behind him we can barely
make out Jennifer’s form. She looks more spectral then we’ve ever seen
her.</p>
<p><strong>int. devil’s kettle high gymnasium - continuous</strong>: The
music fades out and there’s a squeal of feedback from the sound system.
Mr. Wroblewski walks onto the stage in a bad suit. He awkwardly picks up
the mic with his one good hand and pats it with his robotic one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Can I have everyone’s attention
please?</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I
hope you’ve all had an opportunity to consume the Pecan Sandies and
Cran-Grape that were so generously donated by the Parents Club.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: But the real treat is yet to come.
It’s happening right about now, this treat of which I speak. We have
some very special guests tonight. They were kind enough to take a break
from their sold-out national tour and play our dance for free.</p>
<p><strong>chip!</strong>: CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as
Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. She’s wearing a
gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Didn’t you hear me calling your name?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You weren’t calling my name.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yes, I was.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I couldn’t hear it.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think you were maybe spacing out. You
were like this: Derrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to
talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are you worried? `Cause I’m super-
stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: She hasn’t been the same for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think I know what’s wrong with her. In
fact, I know I know what’s wrong with her.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Then tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I feel bad telling you this.</p>
<p>****: Okay, you know Needy’s been a total Lithium candidate since the
night Colin Gray died. But that’s not just because he was brutally
murdered and stuff. It’s because….I don’t wanna say this.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I
mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I know this must be hard for you to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Needy’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s what she wants you to believe. But
trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven’t even heard of.
Total varsity moves.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: But you were with Colin the night he was
killed.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, apparently he had a thing for me– no
surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that
night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty
house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I
left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they’d found…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: …what was left of him.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Eye-talian.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m sorry you had to hear this from me.
I’m just so worried about Needy. She’s losing her shit. Colin was her
everything.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I wouldn’t be surprised if she winds up in
the nuthouse.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I just can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well, you’ve been talking to her more than
I have. How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: It’s bad, man. It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I can only imagine the paranoid theories
she’s come up with.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Oh, you have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I just can’t believe she would do this to
you. I care so much about you, Chip.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: More than I’ve ever had the guts to
admit.</p>
<p><strong>int. high school gym - continuous</strong>: Mr. Wroblewski
pauses dramatically for effect.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wroblewski</strong>: Boys and girls, please welcome…Soft
Shoulder!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Good evening, babies. Are you ready for
some bad vibrations?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Chip!</p>
<p><strong>ext. mc cullum park - continuous</strong>: CHIP is hypnotized
in the glow of the streetlights. Jennifer leans forward and kisses him
on the neck</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Needy didn’t deserve a boy like you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - continuous</strong>: Needy is running toward
the park in her gown. She takes off her shoes and tosses them aside, her
arms and legs pumping furiously.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: One thing people don’t know about me is
that I’m fast. I just never went out for track because I look bad in
shorts. Also, Jennifer told me track was for lezzies. But I am. Fast, I
mean. Even in that fucking afterbirth of a dress, I could really tear up
the asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I had to. I was running for his
life.</p>
<p><strong>int. mc cullum park - continuous</strong>: Jennifer is
kissing Chip. She pulls him down onto the damp, muddy grass.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Ooh, you’re so salty!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Yeah, you too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Say it like you mean it.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You’re so salty. I need water. It burns. The
salty burns my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Say I’m better than Needy.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We really shouldn’t be doing this.</p>
<p>****: You’re better than Needy.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Natch.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: This feels weird. Can we go somewhere
else?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I have just the place.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Murphy Pool? I don’t think we can go in there.
I knew some skater guys who went in there. They got in big trouble and
now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re in big trouble anyway. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. chip’s house - continuous</strong>: Needy jogs toward
CHIP’s house. Exhausted and sweaty, she presses the doorbell. She falls
to her knees on the front stoop, panting and wheezing.</p>
<p>****: Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper home?</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Needy? Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Where’s Chip?</p>
<p>****: He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago. He certainly
should have been there by now.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell
me that in these dangerous, godless times– you let your only son walk
alone at night?</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Well, it’s only five blocks. My God,
your hair is…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Which way did he go?</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: He usually cuts across the park.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Camille, let’s sit like a lady! No one
wants to see your kiki.</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Why don’t you try…</p>
<p><strong>chip’s mom</strong>: Anita?</p>
<p><strong>ext. murphy pool - same</strong>: Murphy Pool is even eerier
from the inside. The fenced-in deck area is littered with garbage,
abandoned pool furniture and graffiti. Someone has spray painted the
word “HOPELESS” on a wall. CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Aren’t you cold?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Never, Trevor. I’m hot like magma.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Swimming.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast
stroke.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: The water looks disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Are you kidding? It’s totally bubonic in
there. I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch. And
that looks like a used syringe over there…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m sorry. I was just trying to make you
laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We’ve both lost a
close friend.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I feel so empty.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Please come here and kiss me again. Make
all this madness go away.</p>
<p><strong>int. mc cullum park - continuous</strong>: Needy runs into
the park and scans the dark horizon. Her bare feet are bloody from
running and her face is shiny with sweat.</p>
<p>****: Chip!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>int. murphy pool - continuous</strong>: Needy staggers toward
the pool, which is surrounded by an extraterrestrial glow. Chip’s
moaning is almost unbearable. Needy stares into the abyss and claps her
hands over her mouth.</p>
<p>****: Needy!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Holy crap!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes:
Please give me the power to crush this bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Fuck this J.V. shit!</p>
<p>****: She can fly?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: She’s just hovering, CHIP. It’s not that
impressive.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God, do you have to undermine everything I
do? You’re such a player-hater.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’re a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more
harsh digs?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You know what? You were never a good friend.
Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour
lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played
Barbies!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And now I’m eating your boyfriend! See? At
least I’m consistent.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Why do you need him? Huh?</p>
<p>****: Why do you need the one guy who’s ever liked me? You can have
anyone, Jennifer!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: The cutest guy in school. The mailman. A
teacher. You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael
Murray. So why Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss me off? Or is it
because you’re insecure?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How
could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially
relevant.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You were skinny then, too!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m gonna eat your soul and shit it out,
Lesnicki.</p>
<p>****: I thought you only murdered boys.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I go both ways.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Ow-Ow-Ow.</p>
<p>****: We hurt you…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Got a tampon?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Thought I’d ask. You seemed like you might
be pluggin’.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Fuck this noise. I’m out. You losers are
more trouble then you’re worth.</p>
<p>****: Why give up now? He’s almost dead! Get your bulimic ass back
here and kill us both!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Nah. I mean, you say I’ve been a bad
friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Oh, Chip!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Needy. You saved me.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m gonna call for help.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Oh no, I’m out of minutes!</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I think 911 is always a free call.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Oh yeah. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: It’s not working. It’s full of
Jennifer-goo.</p>
<p>****: Hey, I’m going somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No! You’re not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: I’m toast, Needy. I’m definitely gonna die. I
think I already died before you were here, but I woke up when I heard
your voice.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Yeah me too. And you look hot in that
dress.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You’re clearly delirious.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: No. When you’re dying, you can see everything
a lot clearer. You can see what’s true and what’s not. The things that
are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of
the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens. And I
know for sure that you’re totally hot.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: You’d better get out of here. The police are
going to come and I don’t want them to, you know, make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m never leaving.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: But I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>int. devil’s kettle high gymnasium - night</strong>: The
dance is in full swing and students are slow-dancing. Girls rest their
heads against boys’ chests, only under far less macabre circumstances
than Needy and CHIP’s deathbed tableau. Soft Shoulder are still playing
onstage, their guitars chiming melodically.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: This sucks old-man balls.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Shut up. It’s good PR.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I said, it’s so good to be here!</p>
<p><strong>ext. c0rvallis high campus- continuous</strong>: Illuminated
by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym entrance. She’s completely
covered in demon-goo. Her face is bloody, her hair is full of blood and
guts, and her BROKEN ARM looks gruesome. In the background, yet another
oblivious COUPLE are making out.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are you looking at, Clumpy?</p>
<p>****: Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your
face.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Are you supposed to be Goth or something?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Did you know the original Goths were a
Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn’t wear black. They wore
regular linen tunics. I don’t know why nobody else knows that.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I think this girl’s flipping out.</p>
<p><strong>dirk</strong>: What could she do to us?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Look at her.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: You didn’t play your hit yet.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: They found Chip the following morning.
The police couldn’t find an explanation for the “substance” in the pool,
so they chose not to mention it to the press. In fact, they treated the
whole incident like a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>int. chip’s house - morning</strong>: We see the POLICE
informing Chip’s mother that his body has been found. She collapses onto
the floor, curling up into the fetal position.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Trouble was, some of us would never wake
up.</p>
<p><strong>int. needy’s bedroom - day</strong>: Needy is lying in bed,
shaking, her arm in a cast. Her mother tries to rouse her.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I never went back to school after that.
Didn’t talk much either. My mom bought some books so she could teach me
at home like crazy Christians with 14 kids do. But I wasn’t a very
cooperative student.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jennifer’s house - night</strong>: Needy is crouched
outside Jennifer’s window, hiding in the shrubbery. She looks almost
feral, with wide eyes and a hungry expression. Through the window, we
see Jennifer sitting at a vanity and combing her hair, oblivious to the
intruder in her yard.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: What nobody realized was that I was
doing a different kind of homework. I was watching her every night.
Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Waiting for her to get weak and dull.
Waiting for her to burn through the life-force she’d stolen from
Chip.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: It took weeks, but I finally made my
move. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: Even in her last moments of life, she
somehow managed to be cooler than me.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: She left an insanely hot corpse.</p>
<p><strong>int. “the hole” - night</strong>: We’re back in solitary
confinement, where Needy has been narrating the whole sordid tale. She
hasn’t moved a muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of
moonlight illuminates the room.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: I don’t even know who Needy Lesnicki is
anymore. I’m a different person now. A person who uses curse words and
kicks orderlies and and sees things that aren’t there. A very bad, very
damaged person.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: But sometimes, change can be good. For
instance, most occult scholars don’t know this, but if you’re bitten by
a demon–and you live– you just might absorb some of the demon’s
abilities.</p>
<p><strong>needy v.o.</strong>: You just might get lucky for once in
your miserable life.</p>
<p><strong>ext. leech lake hospital - five minutes later</strong>: Needy
strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers. She heads confidently
toward the SECURITY FENCE and passes through it after casually mangling
the bars. Only a Needy-shaped hole remains.</p>
<p><strong>ext. county road 9 - ten minutes later</strong>: Needy is
striding purposefully down a dark country road. The hospital recedes in
the background. A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
Needy as she walks past.</p>
<p>****: “Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside
you…”</p>
<p>****: “…And the stars will remind you, we’ll meet again…”</p>
<p><strong>ext. county road 9 - continuous</strong>: Needy holds her
thumb aloft as she walks down the remote country highway.</p>
<p>****: “…We’ll meet again.”</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Where you looking to go, young lady?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: East, toward Madison.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: East, huh? Guess I’m headed that way. But
I’m gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass. Got that? No free
rides in this wagon.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I don’t have any money or drugs, so you’ll
have to settle for ass.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: So why you headed East?</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: I’m following this rock band.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Huh. Must be a hell of a group.</p>
<p><strong>needy</strong>: Tonight’s gonna be their last show.</p>
<p><strong>radio dj</strong>: What a song. Thought we’d play that one in
honor of Soft Shoulder. They’re playing in Madison tonight. Should be a
night to remember…</p>
