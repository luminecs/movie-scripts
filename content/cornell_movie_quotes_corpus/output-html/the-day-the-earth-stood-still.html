<p><strong>british announcer</strong>: Reports are coming in from all
over the Empire – from all over the world. The Government have not yet
issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there
actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at
incredible speed.</p>
<p><strong>american announcer</strong>: We still don’t know what it is
or where it’s from �- but we do know there’s something there. It’s been
tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand
miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>2nd radio reporter</strong>: This is not another “flying
saucer” scare. Scientists and military men have already agreed on that.
Whatever this is – it’s something real.</p>
<p><strong>3rd radio reporter</strong>: We interrupt this program to
give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea. “A
large object, traveling at supersonic speed, is headed over the North
Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>4th radio reporter</strong>: Here in the nation’s capital,
there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic. As a matter
of fact, there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place;
the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds at the various
monuments and public buildings…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: They’re here! They’re here!</p>
<p><strong>brigadier general</strong>: Get me the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p><strong>governmental official</strong>: I want to speak to the
President. I’m sorry – you’ll have to interrupt him.</p>
<p><strong>pearson</strong>: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this
is Drew Pearson. We bring you this special radio-television broadcast to
give you the latest information on the landing of the “space ship” in
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>pearson</strong>: Government and Defense Department officials
are concerned by reports of panic in several large Eastern cities. I am
authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for
alarm. The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on
hysteria and are absolutely false. I repeat – these rumors are
absolutely false!</p>
<p><strong>pearson</strong>: The ship, designed for travel outside the
earth’s atmosphere, landed in Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern
Standard Time. We still don’t know where it came from, but I can reveal
that military leaders are considering two possibilities; that it came
from some unfriendly power here on earth – or that it actually arrived
from another planet.</p>
<p><strong>pearson’s voice</strong>: The ship is resting exactly where
it landed two hours ago, and there has been no sign of life from inside
it.</p>
<p><strong>pearson’s voice</strong>: Troops have been rushed from Fort
Myer and they have formed a cordon around the ship.</p>
<p><strong>pearson’s voice</strong>: They are supported by machine guns,
tanks and artillery.</p>
<p><strong>pearson’s voice</strong>: Behind police lines, there is a
large crowd of curiosity seekers.</p>
<p><strong>pearson’s voice</strong>: As you can see for yourself, the
Army has taken every precaution to meet whatever the situation may
require. Every eye – every weapon – is trained on the ship. It’s been
this way for two hours and the tension–</p>
<p><strong>pearson</strong>: Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! I
think I see something moving!</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We have come to visit you in peace – and
with good will.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Gort! Deglet ovrosco!</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It was a gift. For your President. With this
he could have studied life on other planets.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>first platoon leader</strong>: Got hit in the shoulder,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Send for an ambulance. Get him to Walter
Reed Hospital right away.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: He’s all right, General… Blood
pressure’s a little high, but it could be aggravation.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Can’t blame him. I always get mad when
somebody shoots me.</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: He still wants to see the
President.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: We informed the White House over an hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Didn’t drop any hints about where he’s
from, did he?</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: No, sir, he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Excuse me. What about the reporters,
Colonel? They’re swarming all over the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Tell them there won’t be any statement
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, sir. Mr. Harley’s here from the White
House.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: General –</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Right in there, Mr. Harley.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: My name is Harley – Secretary to the
President I’ve been told that you speak our language – that your name is
Mr. Klaatu.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Just Klaatu.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: The President asked me to convey his deepest
apologies for what has happened. We all feel–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Sit down, Mr. Harley.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’m sure I don’t have to point out that your
arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: About five months – your months.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: You must have come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: About 250 million of your miles.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Naturally we’re very curious to know where
it is you come from.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: From another planet. Let’s just say that
we’re neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: It’s rather difficult for us to think of
another planet as a neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m afraid, in the present situation you’ll
have to learn to think that way.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: The present situation?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I mean the reasons for my coming here.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: We’re very curious about that, too. Would
you care to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’d be glad to. Not now, of course – with
you alone.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Perhaps you’d rather discuss it personally
with the President–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley.
It concerns all the people on your planet.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I – I’m not sure I understand–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I want to meet with representatives from all
the nations of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’m afraid that would be a little awkward.
It’s – it’s completely without precedent. And there are practical
considerations – the time involved – the enormous distances.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I traveled 250 million miles. What about
your United Nations?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: You know about the United Nations?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We’ve been monitoring your radio broadcasts
for a good many years. That’s how we learned your languages. Lately,
we’ve been getting your television also.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: You must have a rather strange impression of
us.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: The first two years of television we were
convinced that all you did was wrestle.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’m sure you recognize from our broad- casts
the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you
would agree–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the
internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business –
not mine.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I was only hoping to make you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: My mission here is not to solve your petty
squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Perhaps if you could explain a little–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I intend to explain. To all the nations –
simultaneously. How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: We could call a special meeting of the
General Assembly… But of course the UN doesn’t represent all of the
nations.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of
State?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Believe me, you don’t understand. They
wouldn’t sit down at the same table.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I don’t want to resort to threats,
Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is
at stake… I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I will make that recommendation to the
President. I must tell you in all honesty that I’m extremely dubious
about the results.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Apparently I’m not as cynical about Earth’s
people as you are.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’ve been dealing in Earth’s politics a good
deal longer than you have. Goodnight, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Getting any place, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No, sir. Beats me, General. I saw that
ramp come out of the side of the ship – right here. Now I can’t even
find a crack!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: What’s the report, Carlson?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: We’ve tried everything from a blowtorch to
a diamond drill.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: He’s made out of the same stuff.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Has he moved?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No sir. Not an inch</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: This is the toughest material I ever saw,
General. For hardness and strength, it’s out of this world.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I can tell you officially -� that’s where
it came from.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: The skeletal structure is completely normal.
Same for the major organs -� heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: And the lungs are the same as ours. Must
mean a similar atmosphere – similar pressure. How old do you think he
is?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Oh, I’d say forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He told me this morning when I examined
him. He’s seventy-eight.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Their life expectancy is a hundred and
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: How does he explain that?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: He says their medicine is that much more
advanced. He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a
third-class witch doctor.</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: I took a bullet out of that man’s arm
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>first major</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: I just examined the wound and it’s all
healed.</p>
<p><strong>first major</strong>: What does he say about it?</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: Said he put some salve on it – some
stuff he had with him.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>major white</strong>: Take it downstairs and have it
analyzed. Then I don’t know whether I’ll just get drunk or give up the
practice of medicine.</p>
<p><strong>first major</strong>: Afternoon, Mr. Harley.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Afternoon, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Good afternoon. I’m glad to see you up and
around.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Thank you… Have you any news?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Not very good news, I’m afraid. The
President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a
meeting last night. Let me read you some of the replies. “The Premier
wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be
impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President
unless the meeting is held in Moscow.” “The suggestion of the President
regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable
to Her Majesty’s Government at the present time. Representation could be
sent only if the meeting were held in Washington.” Well – there you have
it.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I tried to make you understand. The
suspicions – the jealousies – the mistrust– Surely you realize that my
government has done everything in its power–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It’s not your government I’m thinking about.
It’s your world.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Now that you understand the situation more
clearly, perhaps you’d like to discuss the matter with the President</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I will not speak to any one nation or group
of nations. I don’t intend to add my contribution to your childish
jealousies and suspicions.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu.
You mustn’t judge us too harshly.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I can judge only by what I see.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Your impatience is quite understandable.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I am impatient with stupidity. My people
have learned to live without it.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’m afraid my people haven’t. I’m very sorry
– I wish it were otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Before making any decisions, I think I
should get out among your people – become familiar with the basis for
these strange, unreasoning attitudes.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Under the circumstances I’m afraid that will
be impossible.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I must ask that you don’t attempt to leave
the hospital. Our military people have insisted on this. I’m sure you’ll
understand.</p>
<p><strong>radio voices</strong>: –authorities at Walter Reed Hospital
refused to comment on how he managed to escape, or what measures might
be taken to apprehend him.</p>
<p><strong>television commentator</strong>: –while the President made no
effort to minimize the crisis, he urged people all over the country to
remain calm. He said the entire facilities of FBI and other federal
agencies are being bought to bear. He pointed out, however, that this is
no ordinary man hunt. He warned we may be up against powers that are
beyond our control.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: I can’t stand any more of this. It’s
enough to drive a person crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, Mom – who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: for the tension in</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: My name is Carpenter. I’m looking for a
room.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Are you an FBI man?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bet he is, Mom. Bet he’s out looking for that
space man.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think we’ve all been hearing too much about
“space men.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: introductions with aged couple and a
younger but more</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Well – this is our little family. I
have a very nice room on the second floor.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?
I know what he looks like! He’s got a square head – and, three great big
eyes!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s enough, Bobby. I think it’s time you
went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: We mustn’t annoy Mr. Carpenter – or
he won’t want to stay here. She goes on into the hall, followed by
Klaatu, who has exchanged a polite smile with Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: He’s really a dear little boy – and
quiet as a mouse. You’re a long way from home, aren’t you,
Mr. Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Oh, I can tell a New England accent a
mile away.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel heater’s voice</strong>: –and so, this Sunday
morning, we ask the question that’s been plaguing; the entire nation for
two days now: “Where is this creature and what is he up to?” If he can
build a space ship that can fly to Earth – and a robot that can destroy
our tanks and guns – what other terrors can he unleash at will?
…Obviously we must find this monster. We must track him down like a wild
animal and destroy him.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel heater’s voice</strong>: But where would such a
creature hide himself? Would he disappear into the north woods? Or would
he slither off into the sewers of some great city?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel heater’s voice</strong>: There is grave danger –
everyone agrees to that. The question is what can we do to protect
ourselves? What measures can we take that will–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: George, I wish you’d turn that radio
off. I’m trying to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barley</strong>: Why doesn’t the Government do something
– that’s what I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. krull</strong>: What can they do? They’re only people –
Just like us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barley</strong>: People my foot! They’re Democrats!</p>
<p><strong>mr. krull</strong>: It’s enough to give you the shakes. He’s
got that robot standing there – ten-foot tall – just waiting for orders
to destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This space man – or whatever he is. We
automatically assume he’s a menace… Maybe he isn’t at all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barley</strong>: Then what’s he hiding for? Why doesn’t
he come out in the open?</p>
<p><strong>mr. krull</strong>: Yeah. Like the fella says: “What’s he up
to?”</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Maybe he’s afraid.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: He’s afraid!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: After all, he was shot the moment he landed
here. I was just wondering what I would do.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Perhaps before deciding on a course of
action, you’d want to know more about the people here – to orient
yourself in a strange environment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: There’s nothing strange about
Washington, Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: A person from another planet might disagree
with you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: If you want my opinion, he came from
right here on Earth. And you know where I mean.</p>
<p><strong>mr. krull</strong>: They wouldn’t come in a space ship.
They’d come in airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: I wouldn’t be so sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barley</strong>: Stands to reason that fella wants some
thing or he wouldn’t be here. That make sense, Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I must admit I’m a little confused.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Mrs. Benson – Mr. Stevens is here to
see you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barley</strong>: Finish your coffee, George. I told the
Carsons we’d be there at eleven.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’re all set. I picked up some sandwiches and
put gas in the car. And the radio’s still busted, so me can forget about
the space man for today.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s only one thing – I haven’t been able
to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. I don’t suppose we could take
him with us?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, we could–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s always somebody here, but today of
course they’ve all got plans.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu’s voice</strong>: I haven’t any plans.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’d be glad to spend the day with him – if
you’d let me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Say, that’ll be great! Wouldn’t it, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: confused, by the</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday
afternoon. We talked – and listened to the radio. I thought today he
might show me around the city.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about
it.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Those are great words. He must have been a
great man.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: That’s the kind of man I’d like to talk
to.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Bobby – who’s the greatest man in America
today?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee – I don’t know… The space man, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I was speaking of earth men. I meant the
greatest philosopher – the greatest thinker.</p>
<p><strong>b0bby</strong>: You mean the smartest man in the whole
world?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Yes – that would do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well – Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He’s the
greatest scientist in the world.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: thoughtfully, speaks slowly, as he recalls
the newspaper story</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure. Right near where my mother works.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Where is that?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Department of Commerce. She’s a secretary.
They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn’t at all. My
mother’s a real secretary. Mr. Carpenter – now can we go see the space
ship?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Boy, I’ll bet he’s strong. I bet he could
knock down a whole building.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I shouldn’t be at all surprised.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee, I’d like to get inside and see how it
works. What do you think makes it go?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Well – atomic power, I would imagine.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I thought that was only for bombs.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No. It’s for a lot of other things, too.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You think it can go faster than an F- 36?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Yes – I think so.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: About a thousand miles an hour?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And
outside the Earth’s atmosphere a good deal faster.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee! How could they make a landing?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Well – there are several ways to reduce
landing speed. You see, the velocity–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Keep goin’, Mister. He was fallin’ for it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You think they’ll ever find him?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I don’t know, Bobby. I’m inclined to doubt
it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Carpenter – what does velocity mean?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Velocity is the time rate of change of
position.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll bet that’s the way Professor Barnhardt
talks.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Bobby – I have an idea. Let’s go see
Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You’re just kidding, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Wouldn’t you like to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, sure I would, but – Aw, I’ll bet you’d
be scared.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We can scare him more than he can scare
us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You’re a real
screwball.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee – maybe he isn’t home.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Betcha this is where he works–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It’s a problem in celestial mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bet he’s the only one in the world knows the
answer.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: He doesn’t know the answer. And he’ll never
get it that way.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We probably couldn’t get to see him even if
he was home.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey – where you going?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: If he’s that difficult to see, perhaps we
ought to leave a calling card.</p>
<p><strong>hilda’s voice</strong>: What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: desecration of the</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: He’ll catch on to it in no time now.</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: How did you get in here? And what do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We came to see Professor Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: Well, he’s not here. And he won’t be back
till this evening. I think you’d better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu
turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off
the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: You might keep this. I think the professor
will want to get in touch with me.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I wouldn’t erase that. The Professor needs
it very badly.</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: –no, Sergeant, there was no classified
material around, but I have instructions to report anything unusual to
the police… Yes – I’m Professor Barnhardt’s secretary. The man’s name is
Carpenter – and he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W… Yes, that’s right–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s my father. He was killed at a place
called Anzio.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Did all these people die in wars?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure. Didn’t you ever hear of Arlington
Cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Carpenter” – you don’t seem to know about
anything.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’ll tell you, Bobby – I’ve been away for a
long time. Very far away.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Is it different where you’ve been? Don’t they
have places like this?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: They have cemeteries. But not like this one…
You see, they don’t have any wars.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee – that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: What would you like to do this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Go to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No foolin’? Will you?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Certainly. Tell me, Bobby – do you have to
have money to go there?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ve got some money. My mother gave me two
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – I want to take you to the movies. Do
you think they’d accept these?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee – those look like diamonds!</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Some places that’s what people use for
money. They’re easy to carry – and they don’t wear out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bet they’re worth about a million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Would you give me your two dollars for a
couple of them?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, sure, but–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Let’s not say anything to my mother about
this, Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Why not, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: She doesn’t like me to steal from people.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Mr. Carpenter come home yet?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah – he’s right inside.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Tell him I’d like to see him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Carpenter–! Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Your name Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Yes. Oh – I suppose Professor Barnhardt’s
looking far me.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I been looking for you all afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It was a wonderful day.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You still haven’t answered my question.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to
think it over.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I
could tell him I was getting married – with two dependents–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re a good salesman – but I’ve got to
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: A good insurance salesman wouldn’t give you
time to think.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hi Mom!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello, darling. Good evening,
Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Mrs. Benson – this is Mr. Brady.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Brady’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you have a nice day, dear?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Boy, we had a swell time. Didn’t we,
Mr. Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We certainly did.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We went to the movies – and we had ice cream
cones – and we went to see Daddy–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: she’s uneasy and concerned as she</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We better get goin’, Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Aw, gee – we didn’t finish our story.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We’ll finish it tomorrow… Goodnight,
Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mom – why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down
to the police station?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I – I don’t know, dear… Perhaps there’s some
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship
and we went to see Professor Barnhardt – and–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: puzzled, incredulous</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course, dear.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Aw, gee, Mom – I had plans to play with
Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: B.M. Alberts – no prior arrests.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: No identification? Send him over to
G-2.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: My wife just arrived with my
identification.</p>
<p><strong>third cop</strong>: That’ll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to
bother you… Next.</p>
<p><strong>fourth cop</strong>: Cappo, John C? Two priors – one for
petty theft – one for shoplifting.</p>
<p><strong>fifth cop</strong>: Okay, Jonny – you can go.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sometimes a record comes in handy.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: The Professor’s secretary says she found
you in Barnhardt’s room, making marks on his blackboard.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I was only trying to be helpful. He was
having difficulty with a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you
were helping him out.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a
lot of secret work for the Army.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: In this case the secret wouldn’t be worth
much. He doesn’t know the answer himself.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: But I suppose you know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It’s really quite simple… The three- body
problem, you know.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Your name’s Carpenter – that right? Any
identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver’s license – social security
number?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Well, how do I know who you are?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Excuse me, Lieutenant – The Doc says this man
needs treatment right away.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Some fella caught him lookin’ in a window and
figured he was the space man. The whole neighborhood went crazy and they
ganged up on him. Would have killed him if we hadn’t come along… Turns
out he was just a prowler.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Okay – book him and get him fixed up.
Looks like everybody’s goin’ nuts.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: They would have killed this man?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: People get hysterical enough, they do
anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter – if you can’t identify yourself, I got to
send you over to the Army.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: but actually growing</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They can tell right away. They’ve got a
couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to
G2.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It’s very important, Lieutenant, that I see
Professor Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Come on, Mr. Carpenter–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: May I suggest that you call the
Professor?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Get going, will you, Brady – before I
get mad!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Wait a minute, Brady– The Captain here’s
got orders from General Cutler to take this man over to Professor
Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>m.p. captain</strong>: Will you come with me, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>m.p. captain</strong>: This is the man you wanted to see,
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>m.p. captain</strong>: I’ll wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: You wrote this?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It was a clumsy way to introduce myself –
but I understand you’re a difficult man to see. I thought you’d have the
solution by this time.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Not yet. That’s why I wanted to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: All you have to do now is substitute this
expression– –at this point.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Yes – that will reproduce the first-
order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Almost negligible… With variation of
parameters, this is the answer.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: How can you be so sure? Have you tested
this theory?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I find it works well enough to get me from
one planet to another. I understand you’ve called a meeting to study our
space ship.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Yes – yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: My name is Klaatu. I spent two days at your
Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor’s name was Major White – and I
had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who’s getting married next
Wednesday. If you are not interested – or if you intend to turn me over
to your Army – we needn’t waste any more time.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: voice a little</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: You have faith, Professor Barnhardt</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: It isn’t faith that makes good science,
Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. Sit down, please. I have several thousand
questions to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I would like to explain something of my
mission here.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: That was my first question.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It was my intention to discuss this
officially – with all the nations of the Earth – but I was not allowed
the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and
suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society. We
know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary
kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with
rockets.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Yes – that is true.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: In the hands of a mature civilization, these
would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your
people– We’ve observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don’t trust
you with such power.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: If you mean that you are afraid of
us–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We want to be sure you don’t make – let us
say – an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these
developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children…
You see, we’ve had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. We
discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. So long as you were
limited to fighting among yourselves – with your primitive tanks and
planes – we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to
space ships – and then you become a threat to the peace and security of
other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: These other planets – do they have peace
and security?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We had our atomic wars – thousands of years
ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned
that fighting is no solution – that aggression leads to chaos.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: We scientists understand this. Even we
primitive scientists. What exactly is the nature of your mission,
Mr. Klaatu?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I came here to warn you that, by threatening
danger, your planet faces danger – very grave danger. I am prepared,
however, to offer a solution.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Would you care to be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: What I have to say must be said to all
concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: I gather that your efforts on the
official level were not entirely successful.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: unpleasant episode</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: What – what sort of action do you
mean?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Violent action – since that seems to be the
only thing you people understand. Leveling the island of Manhattan,
perhaps – or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Would you be willing to meet with the
group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain
your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various
peoples.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: That’s what I came to see you about.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: It is not enough to have men of science.
We scientists are too easily ignored – or misunderstood. We must get
important men from every field. Educators – philosophers – church
leaders – men of vision and imagination – the finest minds in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I leave that in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: You’d have no objection to revealing
yourself at this meeting?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – not at all.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: What about your personal safety in the
meantime? What about the Army – and the police?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: My name is Carpenter and I’m a very earthy
character living in a respectable boarding house.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t offer you any real
protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary
conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m sure I’ll be quite safe until the
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group
should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m afraid you have no alternative. In such,
a case the planet Earth would have to be– –eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Such power exists?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I assure you such power exists.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: The people who came to the meeting must
be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake. You
mentioned a demonstration of force–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Would such, a demonstration be possible
before the meeting?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Yes – of course.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Something that would dramatize for them
and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that
would affect the entire planet.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: That can easily be arranged.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: easy assumption of</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Why don’t you leave it to me? I’ll think of
something.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Maybe a little demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Something dramatic – but not destructive.
It’s quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all
right? Say about noon?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Going out, dear?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, I’m waiting for Tom to pick me up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Personally, I won’t go out after dark
these days. But then – I’m not courting, am I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. crockett</strong>: Oh – Mr. Carpenter–!</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Everyone seems so–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Jittery is the word.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Bobby’s the only person I know who isn’t –
Jittery.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He has his homework to keep him occupied.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: He’s a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Naturally I think so.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Warm and friendly and intelligent– You know
– he’s the only real friend I’ve made since I’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mr. Carpenter – this is none of my business,
but – why did that detective come here last night?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Oh – they just wanted to ask me a few
questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the
afternoon, but he wasn’t in. Apparently they thought I was looking for
secrets of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I will be in just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: that she hasn’t her coat on, he consults</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: real sarcasm</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Excuse me. I was just going up to my
room.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Have a good time – both of you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why don’t you wait in here while I get my
things?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Tom, that was awful.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m sorry. I guess I’m just tired of hearing
about Mr. Carpenter. I don’t like the way he’s attached himself to you
and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll go get my things.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: All you have to remember is, first find the
common denominator – then subtract.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’ll say goodnight again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mr. Carpenter, I– Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: complete understanding</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bobby – I think it would be better if we
didn’t see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee, why, Mom? He’s my best friend… And he’s
awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see
Professor Barnhardt?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Sure we did! He wasn’t there but we went to
see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mom – is there something wrong with
Mr. Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What do you mean, dear?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I mean – on account of that policeman last
night. You think he’s a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, dear, of course not. He’s a very nice
man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed
and forget about it. ’Night, darling.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Goodnight. Hey Mom – why would he want to be
alone?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Bobby – have you a flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: appearance and his and gets a large</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Why – the light in my room went out. Thank
you, Bobby. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Why don’t you come on in for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bobby–! What are you doing up at this
hour?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I couldn’t go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I followed Mr. Carpenter – right after you
left – and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space
ship!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now, Bobby, just a minute–</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and
he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bobby, you’ve been dreaming again.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No, I haven’t, Mom. I promise you… I saw
it!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where did you see all this, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: On the lawn down at the mall – in that place
with the soldiers out front.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where were the soldiers all this time?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That robot fella grabbed ’em and dragged ’em
inside! I like Mr. Carpenter – but I’m scared, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mustn’t be frightened, darling – It was just
a bad dream. Here – we’ll prove it to you. Tom, will you ask
Mr. Carpenter if he’ll come down for a minute. The room right opposite
mine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now think back hard. You didn’t follow
Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven’t even been out of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yes, I have!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You didn’t really see the space ship. You
just thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’d never call you a liar.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He’s not there. But look what I found in his
room</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: studies it, amazed</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Looks real to me.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Mr. Carpenter’s got a lot of diamonds. He
gave me a couple of them.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He gave these to you?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, not exactly. I gave him two
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This doesn’t make sense… I think the guy’s a
crook. I never did trust him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he’s a diamond
smuggler?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on, darling – we’re going up to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I wonder if we ought to–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bobby and I have had enough excitement for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You think it’s all right for you to stay
here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ve got a good lock on my door. And Bobby’s
going to sleep in my room tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, boy – can I, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are
soaking!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeah – the grass was kind of wet.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh – hello–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: May I see you for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I – I was Just going to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: May I walk out with you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mrs. Benson speaking. Oh, hello…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m at Bleeker’s getting an appraisal on that
diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I – I’m afraid I can’t – not right now. Can I
talk to you later?. Yes, that’ll be fine. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I saw Bobby this morning before he went to
school–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes–?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I want to know what he told you last
night.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I – I didn’t really pay much attention– Bobby
has such an active imagination.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Did you believe what he told you? I have a
reason for asking this – a very important reason.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s another elevator we can use–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Before I ask you to be honest with me,
perhaps I should be completely honest with you–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just twelve.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We’ll be stuck here for a little while –
about thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We could try pushing the other buttons. I
have a flashlight in my purse.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: You see – the electricity’s been neutralized
– all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bobby was telling the truth – wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: My ol’ lady was right. We shoulda got a
place in the country.</p>
<p><strong>cockney</strong>: It’s that space man – that’s wot it is.</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You
should go out and see it for yourself!</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Thanks – I’m enjoying it right here.</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: The whole city has stopped. People are
running around like ants!</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: What a brilliant idea. I never would have
thought of it.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: What about the people who are coming to
the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: I talked to most of them this morning… They
were all very curious about the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Good. Did you speak to our friend
Mr. Carpenter?</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: He’ll be there at 8:30.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Tell me, Hilda – does all this frighten
you – does it make you feel insecure?</p>
<p><strong>hilda</strong>: Yes, sir – it certainly does!</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: That’s good, Hilda. I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: –as far as we can tell, all power’s been
cut off everywhere – with a few exceptions: hospitals, planes in flight
– that sort of thing. I wish I could be more specific but, as you now,
all communications are out telephone, radio, cable – everything. I can
tell you that the President is prepared to declare a state of national
emergency. Before we start discussing plans, I want a report from
Colonel Ryder. What about the robot, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>colonel ryder</strong>: When it was discovered last night
that the robot had moved, I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a
means of immobilizing him. We accomplished that this morning by encasing
him in a block of KL 93. It’s a new plastic material – stronger than
steel.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Is it possible that he’s broken out of this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: No, sir. I’ve Just checked on that. He’s
locked up tight as a drum.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: All right – that means we concentrate on
the man. Up till now we’ve agreed on the desirability of capturing this
man alive. We can no longer afford to be so particular. We’ll get him
alive, if possible – but we must get him! Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Eleanor, did you call the electrician?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone doesn’t
work, either.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Well, call the phone company.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But the phone doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Is it worth anything?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I have never seen such a stone. Will you
please tell me where it came from?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s what I wanted you to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: absorbed by the stone, he shakes his
head,</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Would you like to sell it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No – no, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I’d give you a very good price.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: –I’ve already told you more than I told
Professor Barnhardt, because my life, in a sense, is in your hands. I
thought if you knew the facts you’d appreciate the importance of my not
being – apprehended, – before the meeting tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, of course. Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You hold great hope for this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I can see no other hope for your planet. If
the meeting should fail, then I’m afraid there is no hope.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: It must be twelve-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: then back at him,</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where are you going now?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Back to the boardinghouse. I’ll be safe
there for the afternoon – and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He’s the only
other person who knows anything about–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, wait a minute – there’s someone else.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tom… He was there last night when Bobby told
me what he saw.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course, he doesn’t know anything definite.
He’d talk to me first, anyway, before– We can’t take that chance. I’ll
get in touch with him right away and make sure.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: –But I’ve got to talk to him. It’s terribly
important. When is he coming back?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I don’t know, Mrs. Benson. He left before
noon – before that awful electric business. I’m scared to death,
Mrs. Benson. I – No, he wouldn’t tell me where he was gong. Said it was
something personal.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell him I want to see him the minute he gets
in… No, I’ll call back.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Attention, please…. All flights from National
Airport have been canceled until further notice.. All flights from this
airport have been canceled.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: –Honest, Mary, I’m so scared I can’t sit
still. I’d like to run some place, but I don’t know where to go– ’Bye
now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Call the Pentagon and find out who’s in charge
of this space man business. Whoever it is I want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mrs. Benson’s been trying to get you all
afternoon. She says it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Get this other call first.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Benson – He just walked in. Are
you nervous, too?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, I am, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mrs. Benson is here. Go on in.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tom – I’ve been trying to get you all
afternoon–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ve got some terrific news about your friend,
Mr. Carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Helen, he’s the man from the space ship! I had
that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth’s ever
seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that’s enough for me.
Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn’t he got any
money?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: All right, Tom – it’s true. I know it’s
true.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Never mind about that. You’ve got to promise
me you won’t say a word to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Are you crazy? After what happened today?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You don’t understand. You don’t realize how
important it is.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Important? Of course it’s important. The point
is we can do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to tell you. We
mustn’t do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He’s a menace to the whole world! It’s our duty
to turn him in.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But he isn’t a menace! He told me what he
came here for.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He told you… Don’t be silly, honey – just
because you like the guy. You realize what this’d mean for us? I’d be
the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is that what you’re thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why not? Somebody’s got to get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m not going to let you do it, Tom. Believe
me, this is literally the most important thing in the world.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes?… What’s his name, Margaret? General
Cutler? All right, I’ll hold on.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tom, you mustn’t – ! You don’t know what
you’re doing! It isn’t just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the
world, is involved!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t care about the rest of the world!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’ll feel different when you see my picture
in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I feel different right now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You wait and see. You’re going to marry a big
hero!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m not going to marry anybody.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hello, General Cutler? No, I don’t want to
speak to his aide. I want to speak to the General. Tell him it’s about
the space man… My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n- s.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s right, General. That’s where he’s
staying… Yes, of course I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>general cutler</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens.
I’ll want to talk to you further but I haven’t time now. Deploy all Zone
5 units according to Plan B – immediately.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Attention, Zone 5… Yellow cab, moving north
on B from Ninth Street. Man and woman in back seat. Get the license
number and report.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me
until the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where is the meeting going to be?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: At the ship.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Attention, Zone 5… license number of target
vehicle is W 4936… All vehicles maintain your positions – and hold your
fire.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Attention, Zone 5 – report when target
vehicle passes your position.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s only a few blocks to Barnhardt’s.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m worried about Gort. I’m afraid of what
he might do – if anything should happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Gort? But he’s a robot. I mean – without you,
what could he do?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: There’s no limit to what he could do. He
could destroy the Earth. If anything should happen to me, you must go to
Gort. You must give him this message: “Klaatu barada nikto.” Please
repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: bewildered, she</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Remember those words.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Attention, Zone 5… Section number 2 – block
off Tenth Street at Massachusetts. All vehicles close in.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, what’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Get that message to Gort. Right away–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Gort–! Klaatu – barada – nikto.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yes, sir, we’ve got the body here now.
Downstairs in a cell… No question about it, General – he’s dead all
right… Yes, sir. Yes – I understand.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: General Cutler’s coming down here right
away. Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and post a guard around that
cell. Captain, don’t let anyone in or out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: at Gort, he turns to</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I – I thought you were–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You mean he has the power of life and
death?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: No – that is a power reserved to the
Almighty Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: This technique, in certain cases, can
re-stimulate life for a limited period. It’s a refinement of scientific
principles known to your own people.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But how – how long–?</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: How long will I live? That no one can
say.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I’m sorry, Professor Barnhardt – I have to
ask you to call off this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Call it off? I… But I had permission from
the Army–</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I know you did. But the robots on the loose
now and it isn’t safe around here. You’ll have to get your friends out
of that building.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Gort and I will be leaving soon.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’ll miss you very much – Bobby and I. He
won’t have anyone to play with.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: He’ll have you – and Tom.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No. That’s all finished.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: objective, but not</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen–</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: I called you from your work and from your
homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man
from another planet – the man who came here in this ship. As you all
know, this is no longer possible. I can only say that I share the
bitterness of your disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Gort – berengo.</p>
<p><strong>barnhardt</strong>: –under the circumstances, the Army people
have asked us to leave the building. And, since their concern is for our
safety, I can do nothing but suggest that we comply–</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: with almost stern</p>
<p><strong>klaatu’s voice</strong>: There must be security for all – or
no one is secure… This does not mean giving up any freedom except the
freedom to act irresponsibly.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu’s voice</strong>: Your ancestors knew this when they
made laws to govern themselves – and hired policemen to enforce
them.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: We of the other planets have long accepted
this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all
planets – and for the complete elimination of aggression. A sort of
United Nations on the Planetary level… The test of any such higher
authority, of course, is the police force that supports it. For our
policemen, we created a race of robots– Their function is to patrol the
planets – in space ships like this one – and preserve the peace. In
matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu’s voice</strong>: At the first sign of violence they
act automatically against the aggressor. And the penalty for provoking
their action is too terrible to risk.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: The result is that we live in peace, without
arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression
and war – free to pursue more profitable enterprises. We do not pretend
to have achieved perfection – but we do have a system – and it works. I
came here to give you the facts. It is no concern of ours how you run
your own planet – but if you threaten to extend your violence, this
Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Your choice is simple. Join us and live in
peace. Or pursue your present course – and face obliteration. We will be
waiting for your answer. decision rests with you.</p>
<p><strong>klaatu</strong>: Gort – veracto.</p>
