<p><strong>man</strong>: So. How are you adjusting?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m adjusting okay.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And your new apartment?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Apartment’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are you taking your medication?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It gives me headaches.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But you are taking it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Good. I’ll talk to your physician about the
headaches. Maybe he can change the prescription.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The job’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Do I take “okay” to mean you feel good about
working there?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I said the job is okay.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: That’s right, you did. Have you made any
friends there?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not running for Mr. Popularity.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: You seem a little hostile today.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: No need to call me doctor. I’m a therapist,
not a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s all the same.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Walter, I’d like you to try something for
me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I’d like you to keep a journal.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A diary?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Diaries have sent too many guys to
prison.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ev-i-dence.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Oh. It never crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: It was just an idea.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I thought a journal would encourage you to
reflect.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Reflect.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You think reflection is good.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: It’s very good, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning
from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about
ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships,
our careers, and our goals.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You read that in a book.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Then think about it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There a problem?</p>
<p><strong>male pharmacist</strong>: problem?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Can you read the prescription?</p>
<p><strong>male pharmacist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Can you fill the prescription?</p>
<p><strong>female pharmacist</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then I suggest one of you move your ass,
because if I don’t get my medication I get extremely violent.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You still think fast.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t need to think fast to handle beer.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: ook some talking to convince your super I
was a relative.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I told her all my relatives are
good-looking.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Jesus Christ, man, it’s good to see you!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Seems like the whole world’s gotten
younger.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Got a job at old Frank’s place. His son runs
it now.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Oh man, that kid takes himself real
serious.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, you still with Northland?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Foreman now.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Five years.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Beautiful. How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Booming. Lots of building going on. We can’t
keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I just recommended you. You still had to
prove yourself.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Hey, is that a school?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: K through sixth.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Living across the street from a grade
school. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Something wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I was just thinking of… the noise.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I like the noise.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Law says I can’t come within one hundred
feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window
to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No way, man, you’d rob me blind!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You find me a decent place for under three
hundred a month in this town, and I’ll happily move out of this crap
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I should go. Your sister worries, and when
she worries she yells.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Annette? She’s good… tense.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When can I see her?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is it because of Anna?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I don’t know. She won’t talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re the only one in the family who still
talks to me.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I remember when they all referred to me as
“the little spic poor Annette married.” Except her brother. You treated
me with respect. Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How old is Anna?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: She’ll be twelve next week. We’re throwing a
big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Only if it’s no closer than a hundred
feet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: One hundred and ten, one hundred and eleven,
one hundred and twelve…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah, I’m fucking fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Bob sits down across from Mary-Kay with
a tray of food and a newspaper. He opens the paper and starts to
read.</p>
<p><strong>ary-kay</strong>: So, what’d he do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What did who do?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: You know, the new guy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mind your own business, Mary-Kay.</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Come on, just tell me what he did.</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster</strong>: The winning run on base, and a full
count on Williams, who’s been in a terrible slump. Here’s the pitch.
Williams swings and misses! The Rangers win, ball game over.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Want a ride?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: It’s fucking freezing out here.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: There’s something wrong with this
picture.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What picture?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m talking about you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah, you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: People without cars.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Very weird.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No weirder than a sharp, young, good-looking
woman working in a lumberyard.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What’s weird about that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Most women wouldn’t choose it.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Guess I’m not like most women.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m just quiet.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You don’t hang out with the other guys.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: They’re all assholes.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You never spoke to me before.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought you were a dyke.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Southern light.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Your windows face south. Northern light is
the purest. But southern light is very good.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll buy a plant.</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: ou should buy several. I’ve got shitty light in
my place, but my plants don’t seem to mind. Light’s important, but it’s
not everything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: K through sixth.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Doesn’t it get noisy?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I like the noise.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: My place faces a truck street. I’ve got
cracks in every window from the shaking.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You must hate it.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the
wilderness for a week or two.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What about bears?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They could eat you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah, they could.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You’re damaged.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m not easily shocked.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I get that Vimpression.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: So… what’s your dark secret?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Don’t you think I should know before we have
sex?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Are you going to tell me your deep dark
secret before we have sex?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom</strong>: Walter’s hands shake as he splashes water
on his face. His shirt is off, and he wears just his jeans. He looks up
at himself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: Walter lies back on his bed. Vicki runs her
hand</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: Walter kisses Vicki, then more and more
rapidly, all over, passionately. They roll so she is underneath him.</p>
<p><strong>livingroom</strong>: Vicki walks backwards towards the
bedroom door, pulling Walter’s hand to follow.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: Walter lies next to Vicki, staring up at
the ceiling, spent, still breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: Walter gropes Vicki’s body and urgently
pulls her underwear off.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom</strong>: Walter and Vicki are completely engrossed
in each other, making love.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom</strong>: Walter breaks his gaze from the mirror and
turns the faucet off.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So, you’re not a dyke.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I didn’t say I didn’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course. Sorry. I’m such a fucking
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t tell me I’m not a fucking asshole when
I know I’m a fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What’s the Wproblem?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You think I have a problem?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s been a while since…</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Since you’ve had sex?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How about in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The morning?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I thought I’d stay the night.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Well, Walter, this is going to sound
off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I suffer from insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I
get nightmares and wake up screaming.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I watch the kids arrive at school.</p>
<p><strong>osen</strong>: ow’s the journal?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m still thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I wish you’d give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: But you don’t like coming here. Be honest,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Honest? No.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Good. That’s an honest answer. And why don’t
you like coming here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Honest? Your cheery personality makes my
skin itch.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Is it just my cheery personality that makes
your skin itch?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Maybe it’s the way I look. Or the sound of my
name.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Rosen? I don’t have a problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Because if you did, I know a therapist named
Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t need someone else.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But for the last few weeks I’ve noticed
someone else watching them.</p>
<p>****: I call him Candy.</p>
<p><strong>irl</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: I’d keep away from him.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: The new man. I’d keep away from him, if I
were you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: You don’t want to know, but he’s damaged
goods – real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch
for the advice.</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Just trying to be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Well, Mary, you’re about as helpful as a
broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Hey, there.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Because I like you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s the worst thing you ever did?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: The worst?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Fucked my best friend’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I molested little girls.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Molested little girls?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You’re not joking.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Twelve years in prison is no joke.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How many girls did you molest?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Obviously one too many.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What did you do to them?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How young?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Between ten and twelve. Once a nine-
year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she
was twelve. I always asked how old they were.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: So it was mostly fondling? Shit like
that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I never hurt them. Never.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Twelve years in prison?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The judge had a thing about sex offenders.
Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn’t had a good
lawyer, it would have been twenty-five to thirty.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I told you I’m not easily shocked.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You should be shocked. Or do you get off on
this shit?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Get your kicks somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Hey, I’m not –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Depraved? My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Get the fuck out of here!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You don’t molest little girls anymore, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Never again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: his little table is one heavy bitch.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: herry.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s made from cherry. That’s a hard
wood.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s a nice table.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the
red runs?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah. It’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s my own design. You won’t find another
table like it in the world.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It was a beautiful present.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then why the fuck are you giving it back to
me?!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You need a table.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: he was going to throw it out, wasn’t she?
Just toss it like a scrap of wood.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It wasn’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then what? What?!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: he’s got all this new furniture now. She
said it didn’t fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you
might like it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I made that table for you and Annette, for
your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I know, man. I love this table too. But I
also love my wife.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mariners are pounding the shit out of the
Tigers.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Fucking Mariners.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except
for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal. How
was the party?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: What party?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The birthday party.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Oh, Anna’s. It was great, man. Anna was so
pretty. She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy
tale, you know, like Snow White.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: ant to see?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Ah, come on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t want to see any goddamn
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: They’re just photos I took of the party.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Carlos. I want to see my sister and Anna in
person. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah, man, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: How do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t feel anything.</p>
<p><strong>osen</strong>: You have no feelings for your niece?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She was born after they put me away. How can
I have feelings?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Then why are you talking about this?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Have to talk about something.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: What are you afraid will happen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not afraid. I’m just saying that Carlos
has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn’t careful he’s going to
suffer.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Have you talked to Carlos about your
concerns?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not that crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Do you think you’re crazy?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If I’m not, then what the hell am I doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Why do you think you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know why. It’s part of the parole
deal.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Is that what you are angry about?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Talking to you is like riding on a
merry-go-round.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by
going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How long is this going to take?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: We have a few more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I mean, when will I be normal.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: We have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Will I ever be normal?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I couldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You couldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you know what “normal” is?</p>
<p><strong>osen</strong>: I suppose it’s however society defines it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How do you define it?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then how do you know if your patients are
getting better?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: They usually tell me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How do they know?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: What is your idea of being normal?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What is your idea of being a Jew?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not
going to help you. Why don’t we continue this on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want to be normal!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Then go see a therapist who will tell you
you’re normal!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fuck you, Rosen!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I know –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I know you’re frustrated, Walter, but –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So what should I do? Call the cops? Yeah,
that’s pretty funny.</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Hi, Walter. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fine thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: You know, it’s really a beautiful day out
there, and I was thinking -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Excuse me. Got another load coming in.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She prunes dead leaves from one of them,
then pauses looking at the leaves in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Don’t die on me, you little shit.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You want to go for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What was prison like?</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: ou don’t really –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yes! I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Prison is… time.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You mean the time you’re locked away?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Prison is time. That’s it. You think
time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn’t beat to live, it
just beats… time.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m sorry, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t be sorry for me. I did those things.
No one else did. I’m dealing with that.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: My father took me fishing here when I was a
kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named,
he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sounds like a special guy.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: My father was an alcoholic who drank himself
right into the grave.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ve changed.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Why young girls, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Their power. They seduce me.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: They seduce you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was always the one seduced.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. That’s what I used to tell myself. V</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: And what do you tell yourself now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nothing. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay. Then take me home.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I want you to change my mind!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I had this plan once… or maybe it was a
dream. I was going to quit the building business… open my own shop. Make
and design fine country furniture. I had saved enough money. I found the
perfect place. Cheap five-year-lease. The loan was in the bag. My wife
was a hundred percent behind it. Everything was set… Then I got in
trouble. Do you know what the worst kind of trouble is?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know, this is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Being here, with me.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Most people say the odds are against me.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What odds?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The percentages –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Well, most people are stupid. You want to
talk about odds? One day I’ll tell you how I survived as the youngest in
a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why not tell me now?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I got poked around… here and there.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Which brother did this?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: All three – in chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You must hate your brothers.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I love my brothers.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I love all of them. They’re strong, gentle
men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they
did to me, they’d call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of
you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You never asked them about it?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not ever?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Not ever.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Hiya, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Cop.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sergeant Lucas. May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You are in.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: So I am. But I always like to ask.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why don’t you just tell me?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Then you won’t mind if I look around.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Got something to hide?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Doesn’t everybody?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I could get a search warrant.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you could, you would have brought one
today.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Cherry?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Unusual design for a contemporary piece.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Who said I wanted to buy it?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Seems there’s been a number of attacks
on young girls in the vicinity. Kind of a coincidence, wouldn’t you
say?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you tell me when this happened –</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Move your fucking hands away from your
pockets!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You can’t talk to me like –</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a
piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window
right now?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: I could say you jumped when I came in.
Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you’d be a dead piece of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I followed a girl.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know why I did it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She was pretty. Very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Can I help you find something?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, I’m –</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Did she know that you were following her?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: What did you think would happen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: What did you want to happen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Is this the first one?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course it is! That’s why I’m telling
you!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I want you to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want to talk about it now.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: We’ll talk about it more on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Remember when you asked me what my idea of
“normal” was?</p>
<p><strong>osen</strong>: Go home, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Now I know. It’s when I can see a girl, be
near a girl, even talk to a girl… and walk away. That’s my idea of being
normal.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe this isn’t a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Us seeing each other.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not scared.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe you should be.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Well, Walter, I got an idea of my own.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Live together.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Move in with me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I think it’s a fucking good idea.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t even know how to live with
myself.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Just think about it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ve got problems.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Most people don’t have my kind of
problems.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Guess that makes you pretty special.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She’s gone. That was easy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: hat’s this?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What’s it look like?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t need a plant.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough
baby. It’s a cutting from one of mine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You’re such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not scared.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Hi, Walter. How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fine thanks. How are you, Mary-Kay?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Well, I’ve got this problem. I promised my
sister that I’d baby- sit her little girl tonight while she’s on a date.
Single mother, right? Her daughter’s a cute little thing, about nine or
ten. Real entertaining. But once she’s asleep, I get soo bored. I’d love
to have some company.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I got plans.</p>
<p><strong>osen</strong>: You’re very late.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Please don’t do it again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I can’t move my patients around to
accommodate one person.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You mean my problem?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: If by “problem” you mean your desire for
prepubescent girls, yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: That’s not a helpful answer.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s my answer.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: lose your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I’d like you to close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: To relax.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Close your eyes and let your mind be
blank.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: No, I am not going to –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I’m all
yours. Do it, Rosen.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: When I say the word “girl” what is the
earliest image that you can remember?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nothing. Can I open my eyes?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: No. When I say the word “pretty,” when I say
the word “pleasure,” what is the earliest memory you see?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t see –</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: In your mind, Walter. Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: see my sister.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Where is she? What is she doing? ow old –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not so fast.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Sorry. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In my bedroom, sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In my bed too.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: How old are you and your sister?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We’re little kids.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: But roughly, how old?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m maybe about six… which would make her
four.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: And what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just lying there. We’re taking a nap.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: A nap?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a
nap, Rosen?</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Did you and your sister often take naps
together?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want you back in your chair! Right
now!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t like nobody behind my back!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been there.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Walter looks away, quelling his anger.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Did you touch her? Did you take off her
clothes? Did you take off your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is garbage!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I’m only asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay I’ll tell you what I did – just to shut
you up! I smelled her hair.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s all. I just liked smelling her
hair.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: You felt pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Did you get an erection?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was six years old!</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: I meant later… when you two took naps.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It was a small house.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: All right. A small house… with small
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I smelled her hair. That’s it. I just liked
smelling her hair.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I’ve got some good news.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Annette will see you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Next week? The week after?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Early July.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tell Annette I’m busy in July.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: C’mon, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You should see my appointment book. It got
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: The important thing is that you and Annette
need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not a monster.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You’re a good man, Walter. Okay, you did
some wrong things, but inside you’re a good, decent man.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe I’m not a good man. Maybe inside I’m
bad, and I’ll always be bad.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: on’t talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t have to tell me this.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I’m just talking, man.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Carlos, I never raped a woman.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I know. I’m just saying I understand.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe because you’re looking her in the
face.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I see a pretty woman, I look. That’s the
price of beauty, my friend. My god, you should see what Anna’s friends
wear.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Carlos, can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: othing.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Ask me. Ask me anything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you ever… Do you have feelings for
Anna?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I mean… feelings.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Listen, man. I don’t got your sick problem,
and if you or anybody else ever comes near my daughter, I’ll kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Walter…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t touch me… please.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good morning, fellow sports fans. The match
is about to begin. Candy enters the arena looking sweet and trim. He
checks out the scene but plays it cool. He’s definitely holding back.
Uh-oh, Candy’s eyes have locked onto something. Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sneak up behind me like that.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What’s your fucking problem?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why’s it always my fucking problem?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Do you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I need a shower.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Birds.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: There’s a million birds here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: In that birch tree is a nest.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: There’s little chicks! You want to see?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They’re starlings.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t like starlings.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They’re extremely aggressive birds. Plus,
their habits are rather filthy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The mother sure has her hands full.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: When I go bird-watching. It’s why I like
coming here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s just a city park.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’d be surprised how many kinds of birds
you’ll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before
that, I saw a solitary vireo. That’s rare.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A solitary vireo. I like that one.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Their sound is quite musical.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How does it sound?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s hard to describe.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I bet you can.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s a bright sound.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: That was terrific.</p>
<p><strong>irl</strong>: You should hear the bird.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You live around here?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Not too far.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Are you a bird-watcher too?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Me? Nah. I’m more of a people watcher.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Were you watching me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not at first. You would stare at the tops of
the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and
fly.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you come here often?</p>
<p><strong>irl</strong>: My daddy likes me home before dark.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s good to listen to your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I followed a girl.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I talked to a girl… I was near a girl… Jesus
God! What did I want to happen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe it’s like Rosen said. Maybe I wanted
nothing to happen.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fucking Rosen! This isn’t helping.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Hiya, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These
plants don’t like a lot of sun. W</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They grow outside, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Sure they do. But outside they’ve got trees
around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants
enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature’s symbiotic
relationships.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You going to take me on a nature walk?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Don’t be witty. Yesterday you took the number
twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop,
for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: You walked home.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Some of these guys… They walk right into a
family’s home as if they live there. Very fucking ballsy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fairy tales?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Do you believe in them?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Neither do I. What’s the one with the
woodsman?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Woodsman?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: The one with the ax?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf’s stomach,
and the girl steps out alive.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: That’s it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out
of the wolf’s guts with hardly a scratch. Ever see a seven-year-old girl
sodomized almost in half?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You knew her?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The girl.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I don’t know why they keep letting scum like
you return to the streets. It just means we’ve got to catch you all over
again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You have no right to talk to… to speak like…
I am not!… I am not!</p>
<p><strong>irl</strong>: Wallie, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Don’t tell me you feel sorry for this sick
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Mind your own business, Pedro!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell is going on here?!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Have you seen Walter?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: Lovers’ quarrel?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>mary-kay</strong>: People have the right to know.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: If she’s here tomorrow, I’ll fucking kill
her.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Thanks again. I promised I’d take care of his
plants.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Children abound, playing, running free,
getting off of school buses, running to meet their parents. There is no
sign of Walter.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: See anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s my bird book.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where are your friends?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I have friends.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A pretty girl like you should have a lot of
friends.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m not pretty.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well… not in the common way.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It means uncommon beauty is commonly
overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Robin.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yeah, like the bird.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Can I ask how old you are?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m twelve.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I will be in three months. I can’t wait. I
hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Do you have many friends?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A long time ago, I was sent far away. When
they let me come back, all my friends were gone.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It sounds like you were banished.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Banished… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Birds are my friends. That sounds
egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don’t mind
because they like being watched… if they know you won’t hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Robin?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Would you like to sit on my lap?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Would you like to sit on my lap?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m sure. Thank you all the same.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s okay… doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Do you want me to sit on your lap?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. I would enjoy that.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They sound like finches.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They could be finches. I don’t know. We
should go before it gets dark.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My daddy lets me sit on his lap.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Does he?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you like it when he asks you?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ms. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes you can, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What will happen if I do?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Someone will talk to your daddy. And then
he’ll stop doing those things… the things you don’t like.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: But will he… ?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Your daddy will always love you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know because… it’s just something I
know.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I don’t want to hurt my daddy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Robin, listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Do you still want me to sit on your lap?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You should go home.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Can’t I stay a little longer?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s getting dark. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Will I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Go home, Robin.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close-up</strong>: Robin lowers the binoculars and
stares us straight in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Hi ya, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I’ll be asking the questions. Last night, you
hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: man was badly beaten across the</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I didn’t say what time the assault
occurred.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You said last night. I went to bed pretty
early.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: The assault took place at approximately seven
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I went to bed around seven.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I could take you downtown.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You could. It’d be a waste of your time,
though.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: There was a boy there.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I suppose if you’re looking for a male
between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight,
medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause
the irony goes right over my head.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have a passionate girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: What’s with the boxes?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re a cop. Figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: I’d say you’re moving.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a free country, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: The passionate one?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Then I’d say you’re a lucky fellow.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I count my blessings.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Think you’ll catch this guy?</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Oh, yeah. We’ll catch him. Unfortunately, the
victim can’t talk. In addition to his other injuries, his jaw is
broken.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: `Fraid not.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Stay out of trouble, Walter. Cause I’ll be
watching you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Fucking liar.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I heard they were filthy birds.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Not when they fly.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I saw my sister.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It was hard.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: I understand that. I do. I just hope… I
just want her to…</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: Accept you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>rosen</strong>: How do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I feel… okay.</p>
