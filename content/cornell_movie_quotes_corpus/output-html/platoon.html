<h1 id="platoon">platoon</h1>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: That what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: I guess so …</p>
<p><strong>sergent</strong>: Okay, let’s go …</p>
<p><strong>veterans</strong>: Well I’ll be dipped in shit - new meat!
Sorry bout that boys - ‘sin loi’ buddy … you gonna love the Nam, man,
for-fucking-ever.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What are you waiting for? He ain’t gonna
bite you. Move out.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Bravo Two, Six. What’s the delay up there,
move it out on point. We’ve got a link up at Phase Line Whiskey at One
Eight Zero Zero, over.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant wolfe</strong>: Two Bravo, Two move it out. Six
says we’re jamming ’em up back there. Over.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Tell that dipshit to get fucked. Get that
other freshmeat up here. Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What the hell’s the matter with you Taylor!
You a sorry ass motherfucker. Fall back.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Ants. I got ants on my neck …</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah, black ants are killers, you look sick
man. You need a little salt.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: You’re humping way too much, troop, don’t
need half this shit. I’ll haul it for you but next time you check it out
with me okay?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You’re a sick mother Bunny.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Hold it up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m okay … I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Shit, King, it ain’t d-e-r-e man, it’s
d-e-a-r, and Sara don’t have no two r’s in it, fool. Shame on you.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Don’t matter, she knows what it means … an she
don’t read too good nohow …</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Mumm, any time sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Lerner, you’d choke to death on it.</p>
<p><strong>captain harris</strong>: Sky Six reports a fresh company of
NVA moving across from Cambodia to this blue line. We got a good chance
to light ‘em up tonight. All platoons will set squad-size ambushes
before full dark. Lt. Wolfe You ’bush in this area near that ol’
Buddhist temple we passed on the hump in. Lt. Hawkins, you take this
area in the rubber plantation…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant wolfe</strong>: No problem sir …</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the
fruitcake man.</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: Fuck you bitch.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: C’mon man, didn’t I do you right that time I
give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat
turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit ’cept me so don’t start
your game playing with me Junior.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat
laundry gig for’ you do.</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: De fool think he’s gonna get it but he
ain’t known for his thinking.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: He’s a fool alright but you a bigger fool.
Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain’t gonna dig itself
…</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Hey Taylor, you don’t know it but I saved
your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog.</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: That reminds me, I gotta take a
shit.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: You gonna wipe your ass dis time?</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: Yeah if you let me have your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility
of Reason. That’s what this place feels like. I hate it already and it’s
only been a week. Some goddamn week, grandma … … the hardest thing I
think I’ve ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week - I don’t even
know what I’m doing. A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and
I wouldn’t know it, I’m so tired. We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day,
camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night
ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle. It’s scary cause nobody
tells me how to do anything cause I’m new and nobody cares about the new
guys, they don’t even want to know your name. The unwritten rule is a
new guy’s life isn’t worth as much cause he hasn’t put his time in yet -
and they say if you’re gonna get killed in the Nam it’s better to get it
in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don’t suffer that much. I
can believe that … If you’re lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at
night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4
hours a night, but you don’t really sleep … I don’t think I can keep
this up for a year, grandma - I think I’ve made a big mistake coming
here …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just
got hit 15 kliks north of here.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the
trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah, they got two Lieutenants and a
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: Who do you want on ambush, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Elias - you take your squad and I’ll take
Tex and Francis from your squad. We move out in two-zero mikes.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: I thought it was O’Neill’s turn tonight.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu
Sheng’s going on R&amp;R, you don’t want to send their asses out on an
ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: They don’t know shit Barnes, and chances are
we gonna run into something.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: So what am I going to do! Get one of my
guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty
fucking sleep!</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Hey O’Neill why don’t you cool it, you don’t
have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Fuck you Elias.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You get your men ready Elias …</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Fucking guy’s got 3 years in and he thinks
he’s Cochise or something …</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Shit, looks like rain. All night too. Gonna
grow mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Goddamn ain’t no justice round here, you
break your ass for de white man … gonna get our act together, do some
rappin’ wid de brothers, change things …</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What’s O’Neill have a nose up the
lieutenant’s ass already, how come we always get ambush.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Politics, man, politics. We always getting
fucked around here.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Hey Chris, I show you a picture of Lucy
Jean?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Yeah she’s the one all right … that’s Lucy
Jean. She’s a-waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah she’s real pretty, you’re lucky …</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Don’t need this or this … you’re doing okay.
Just stick close to Tex, do what he does. Tex you got Junior and Taylor
here on your position.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Damn, ’Lias this gun’s boss. Put Taylor
someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: You got Taylor … … Gardner you go with me
‘Case somethin’ happens to you, you get separated or lost don’t yell out
okay. Sit tight. We’ll get to you.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Okay, let’s move out.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Taylor, you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Uh hunh.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: You sure you know how to work the claymore?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Okay … don’t catch no zzz’s on me buddy or I’ll
sling your motherfucking ass … You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah. Hey Tex - you’re ten minutes fast.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Sin Loi.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Junior!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Unh? … Unh.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shaddup! You’re snoring … Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … ’Course Mom and Dad didn’t want me to come,
they wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard- working, making
$200 a week, a little house, a family. They drove me crazy with their
goddamn world, grandma, you know Mom, I don’t want to be a white boy on
Wall Street, I don’t want my whole life to be predetermined by them.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … I guess I have always been sheltered and
special, I just want to be anonymous. Like everybody else. Do my share
for my country. Live up to what Grandpa did in the First War and Dad the
Second. I know this is going to be the war of my generation. Well here I
am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about - they
come from the end of the line, most of ‘em, small towns you never heard
of - Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum,
Pennsylvania. Two years’ high school’s about it, maybe if they’re lucky
a job waiting for ‘em back in a factory, but most of ’em got nothing,
they’re poor, they’re the unwanted of our society, yet they’re fighting
for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they’re the
bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that’s why they call
themselves ’grunts’ cause a ‘grunt’ can take it, can take anything.
They’re the backbone of this country, grandma, the best I’ve ever seen,
the heart and soul - I’ve found it finally, way down here in the mud -
maybe from down here I can start up again and be something I can be
proud of, without having to fake it, maybe … I can see something I don’t
yet see, learn something I don’t yet know … I miss you, I miss you very
much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s your shift, man …</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Feed me!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Easy Tex easy boy!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Doc over here! Gardner’s hit.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: ’Right there.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: … godamn! Godamn! DUMB FUCKER, DUMB FUCKER!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Oh shit, Doc he’s hit too.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m hit …</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: That dumb fuck didn’t blow his claymore!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: … it’s a scratch, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Doc … tell me the truth, don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: He let’em walk right up on us. He was
sleeping on his shift.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I was not … it was your …</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Self-preservation’s the first law of nature.
Gotta learn how to work your shit Taylor. Watch me, don’t let’em go into
shock.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Shut up! Shut up - and TAKE IT! TAKE THE
PAIN!</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: You gonna be okay Taylor, okay, don’t
you start worrying now.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you … do you know you’re gonna die … Big
Harold? … do you feel like … like … everything’s gonna be fine and then
…</p>
<p><strong>big harold</strong>: Bullshit man, you gettin outta the
field, man. Three hots a day, white sheets, dem pretty white nurses give

Better save yo strength Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell

<p><strong>big harold</strong>: Shaddup bitch.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s not … so bad … dying. How long .. it
…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: That’s no NVA man. That’s a chink - look at
’em, the cocksucker’s six and a half feet tall. Look at his gear - good
as ours.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Shit I blew my claymore right in one dude’s
face and I seen him walking around afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>manny</strong>: What we fighting here, vampires?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Blood trail just keeps going and going but no
body.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: How the hell did he get away?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit ‘em up.
Hard core fuckin’ NVA. They got their shit together.</p>
<p><strong>ring</strong>: Sarge - Doc wants you. There’s a problem with
the new man.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Chopper’s on the way Gardner, hang in there,
you gonna be okay …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Take a good look at this lump o’shit …

guaran-goddamn-tee you, a trip out of the bush - IN A BODYBAG. Out here,

dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Let de white boy carry his ass, he this dude
that got him fucked up. Who’d be hauling his ass if that was a brother
laying there?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Man’d be alive if he’d had a few more days to

<p><strong>all</strong>: ‘… So take a good look at my face. You’ll see
the smile looks out of place. Look a little bit closer. It’s easy to
trace. The tracks of my tears…’</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: New Year’s Day, 1968. Just another day.
Staying alive. There’s been a lot of movement neat the Cambodian border,
regiments of NVA moving across. A lot of little firefights, ambushes, we
drop a lot of bombs, then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in a
landscape …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Pssst!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Bunker …</p>

<p><strong>francis and others</strong>: Manny? … Manny?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We had to get to the village before dark so
we left Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the
engineers … But it was King who found him … about 1000 yards downriver,
not far from the village - It was the end of the mystery.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … the village, which had stood for maybe a
thousand years, didn’t know we were coming that day. If they had they
would have run … Barnes was at the eye of our rage - and through him,
our Captain Ahab - we would set things right again. That day we loved
him …</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Hey pig, pig - come here, pig, pig.</p>

<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Betcha the old bitch runs the whole show.
Probably helped cut Manny’s throat. Probably cut my balls off if she
could. Come on, man, let’s do her.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Let’s zap all these motherfuckers! Let’s do
the whole village!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Where’d he get these wounds?</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: He says he was hit in a bombing raid.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: He’s a dink fosure.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Ask him what the weapons are doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: He says they had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no. He says the rice is theirs.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Bullshit … who the hell was the dink we just
nailed on the riverbank?</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: … He says he doesn’t know, NVA haven’t been
around in a couple of months. Maybe it was a scout or …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah sure it was. What about all that
fucking rice and the weapons … who they for? Cocksucker knows what I’m
saying … don’t you Pop?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: You’re goddamn right he does!</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: He swears he doesn’t know anything! He hates
the NVA but they come when they want and …</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: He’s lying through his teeth!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Waste the fucker, then see who talks.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What’s the bitch saying?</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: She’s going on, I don’t know - why are we
shooting the pigs, they’re farmers … they got to make a living, all that
crap …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Tell him he talks or I’m gonna waste more of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Go ahead, Lerner, ask him.</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: They don’t know Sarge, they don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Hey Sarge can we get in on this.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Let’s go all the way, let’s go for it! Let’s

<p><strong>tony</strong>: Take her up the ass …</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What the fuck you want - she’s a dink.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s okay … it’s okay …</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay …</p>
<p><strong>captain harris</strong>: … and you Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant wolfe</strong>: I didn’t see anything sir.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant wolfe</strong>: That dink was reported to me as
NVA sir by Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: My report sir, will include Lt.Wolfe as being
witness to the shooting …</p>
<p><strong>captain harris</strong>: All right, Elias. Sergeant Barnes, I
want a report from you …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You got it sir - and I can throw in plenty
of eye- witnesses if you want sir …</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Not now. We’ll get into this when we get
back to base camp. Right now I need every man in the field, I want your
guys to stick together … Elias? Barnes? … You hear me? This is no time
for fighting with each other. Tomorrow we’re going back into that bunker
complex - from the East. First Platoon will lead … Brigade thinks they
might be back there tomorrow. That’s all … Get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: Don’t worry about it Sergeant, he won’t be
able to prove a thing, he’s a troublemaker but …</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Elias’ a waterwalker … like them politicians
in Washington. Want to fight their war with one hand tied round their
balls. Ain’t no time or need for a courtroom out here …</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: How’d it go.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Thataway Sarge, fuckin’ Elias man, fuckin’
squeal that’s what he is, gonna get everybody in the platoon in shit.
Somebody oughta fix his ass …</p>
<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Gonna be an investigation or something

<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Ya worry too much O’Neill …</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: I know Barnes six months and I’ll tell ya
something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Barnes gets killed, his jaws’d go on clacking
…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where’s he form?</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Barnes comes from Hell.</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Tennessee someplace. Hill country.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang
Valley … And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that’s BAAAD man. That’s his
high, baby. High on WAR!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then
when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been
in the field …</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: … and you know how many times he done been
shot? Seven times! Seven.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And he still wanted to come back?</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Does a pee wee wanna take a wee wee?</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: The Good Lord works his revenge in strange
ways.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Does he have a metal plate in his head?</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: You mean he’s crazy? No more crazy’n the rest

<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Well he ain’t normal that’s fosure.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: That’s what he is … Baaaa!</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: … and he’s FILLED with it. He’s roaming these
jungles looking for little yellow devils to kill. Remember the Devil
does God’s work too. … and this here’s Elias … Baaaa!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Love, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: Here we go again with the crazy preacher
stuff. Rhah seen too many movies.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love
and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where’s Elias come from?</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: ’Lias come naturally.</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: … don’t know. Done some time. Heard he
worked the oil wells in Oklahoma, made some bread and washed up in El
Lay.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Yeah, get married to some crazy El Lay bitch,
an actress or somethin’, she blew all his bread - LSD, gurus, all that
California shit, and then she turns him into the cops on a drug rap.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Not the only man to meet his Jezebel
either.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam’s
his freedom man, Nam’s his pussy. Three years he been here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Three years, Jesus, he’s crazy as Barnes
…</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Well sometimes a man jes don’ wanna go back.
How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don’t
give a shit, y’know what I mean, to them you’re a fuckin’ animal is all
-</p>
<p><strong>lerner</strong>: I was home on leave y’know and everybody’s
just worried ’bout making money, everybody’s out for themselves, they
don’t even want to talk about it man, it’s like the fucking Twilight
Zone back there - you wouldn’t even KNOW there’s a war on here. My
sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this …</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what!
What’d you’all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They’re
ROBOTS man - watchin’ dopey television and drivin’ dopey cars, and they
fuck up, nobody dies. That’s all right, you keep fuckin’ up, politicians
keep lyin’. Cause it don’t really matter. Don’t mean shit. So what!
Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got
no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You’re fighting for
YOURSELF man! You’re fighting for your SOUL, dat’s all. Remember dat.
And it’s some goddamn battle too - if you’se a man, wrestle with that
angel … … Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that’s the story then
and now and it ain’t hardly gonna change …</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … I can’t sleep, why don’t you get some sack
time.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: … don’t feel like it either.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … beautiful night.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars …
there’s no right or wrong in them, they’re just there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s a nice way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Barnes got it in for you, don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Barnes believes in what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And you, do you believe?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: In ’65 - yeah. Now … No. What happened
today’s just the beginning. We’re gonna lose this war …</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You really think so … us?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: … we been kicking other people’s asses so
long I guess it’s time we got our own kicked. The only decent thing I
can see coming out of here are the survivors - hundreds of thousands of
guys like you Taylor going back to every little town in the country
knowing something about what it’s like to take a life and what that can
do to a person’s soul - twist it like Barnes and Bunny and make ’em sick
inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your
life cause it’s cheap, killing is cheap, the cheapest thing I know and
when some drunk like O’Neill starts glorifying it, you’re gonna puke all
over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over
again, you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself ’cause you
know, you’ve seen it, and when you know it, deep down there …</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: … you know it till you die … that’s why the
survivors remember. ’Cause the dead don’t let em forget.</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Oh shit! Sometimes there’s things in my head
… man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian …</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you believe that stuff about … knowing
you’re gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really
don’t think Death gives a shit, it’s like a giant garbage can, I think
it takes whatever it can get … you never know where it’s gonna come from
anyway … so why spin your wheels?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … You ever think about reincarnation, all
that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>elias</strong>: Sure, goes on all the time. Maybe a piece of
me’s in you now, who knows. But when you die - really die - that’s a big
return ticket. I like to think I’m gonna come back as … as wind or fire
- or a deer … yeah, a deer …</p>

<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You pussies gotta smoke this shit so’s you
can hide from reality? … Me I don’t need that shit. I AM reality.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: There’s the way it oughta be and there’s the
way it is. ’Lias he was full of shit, ’Lias was a crusader - I got no
fight with a man does what he’s told but when he don’t, the machine
breaks down, and when the machine breaks down, WE break down … and I
ain’t gonna allow that. From none of you. Not one …</p>

<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Death? What do you guys know about it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They sent us back into the valley the next
day - about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion perimeter.
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and
Charlie Company had been probed that night. There were other battalions
in the valley, we weren’t the only ones but we knew we were going to be
the bait to lure them out. And somewhere out there was the entire 141st
NVA Regiment.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: … they caught ‘em last night pulling some shit
on Charlie Company. They found maps on ’em, man - got a friend at
Battalion says they had every fuckin’ foxhole here fixed on it.
Distances, treelines, our claymores, trip wires, everything? I shit you
not.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Shit, so what the fuck are we doing here? Why
don’t we move … Bad vibes, man, I got bad vibes here. Where are the new
guys they provided us anyway.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I heard we’s in Cambodia right fuckin’
NOW.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You kidding man …</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: You wanted to see me sir?</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: Jackson, looks like you got Elias’ squad
now.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Squad? I didn’t know we was still referring to
this platoon in terms of squads sir.</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: These two holes are yours …</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes
are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody’d
see them - I got five live bodies left …</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: I don’t want to hear your problems, Jackson.
You’ll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Hey Lieutenant I didn’t ask for this job, I
…</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: I don’t want to hear about it Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: You don’t want to hear about it?</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: That’s right. I don’t want to hear about it
’cause to tell you the truth, I don’t give a shit okay … I just don’t
give a shit anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Right …</p>
<p><strong>wolfe</strong>: This is one time we could sure use Elias.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: ‘Some people say I’m wishy washy. Maybe I am.
Maybe I ain’t.’</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Glad I ain’t going with ‘em. Somewhere out
dere man is de Beast and he hungry tonight … Man, what a bummer. Ten
days and a wakeup and I’m still dealing wid this shit - fuckin’ etcetera
and ad infinitum man …</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What’s the matter wid you? … How come you
ain’t writing no more? You was always writing something home. Looks like
youse half a bubble off, Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What about your folks? That grandma you was

<p><strong>king</strong>: Girl?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Must be somebody?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … there’s nobody.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta
control that. Takes a man down … I remember when you first come out to
the bush, you was straight as a …</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who gives a shit!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: ‘People say I’m the life of the party cause I
tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside
I’m blue …’</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Y’ever get caught in a mistake King and you
just can’t get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Way out of anything, man. Just keep your
pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you
short?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Not just me … it’s the way the whole thing
works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on
making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around
in the middle and suck on it! We just don’t add up to dry shit.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did,
babe. Make it outta here, it’s all gravy, every day of the rest of your
life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!</p>

<p><strong>o’neill</strong>: Yes sir -</p>
<p><strong>rhah</strong>: Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I think now, looking back, we did not fight
the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us … The war is
over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days. As I
am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called
possession of my soul … There are times since I have felt like the child
born of those two fathers … but be that as it may, those of us who did
make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we
know and to try with what’s left of our lives to find a goodness and
meaning to this life …</p>
