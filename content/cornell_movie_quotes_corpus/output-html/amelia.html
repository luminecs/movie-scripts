<h1 id="amelia">amelia</h1>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Sure I can’t talk you inta somethin’ more
adventurous?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Adventurous? You’ve got the wrong girl,
Mister. You should know that by now.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Actually. I knew that the moment I met ol’
George.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I like how you don’t talk about him.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: That why I get so many chances to not do
it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well. Natural curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the
show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll bet he knew that. First time he met
you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He thought I hated him. He never knew I was
fascinated.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The first time I met her she sat in that
chair.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You may as well write it down, Mary. Write
it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or
boring.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll see if I remember how to edit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d kept her waiting two hours.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: She hated me on sight, but she</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She was a person who cherished her privacy
and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my
authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator.
But then I guess you know all that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for
compliments.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The waiting made her furious. She
undoubtedly felt I was</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: stablishing my dominance and</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Actually, I hadn’t given her a thought.
Oblivious as usual. Which, perhaps, was even worse.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I figured he’d be pompous.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I knew, of course, that he wasn’t going to
choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But to be rejected by this… parasite. A man
who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I didn’t know whether to laugh or throw
something at the jerk.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Miss Earhart?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Mr. Putnam? I asked you to sit.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Was that the thing you did with your hand?
Sadly, I don’t speak dog.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A Ah. Well, stand if you like. melia
sits.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m told you want to fly the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people
in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have
died.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Three women died trying. Two others escaped
with their lives. If you do make it, you’d be the first. Which…is the
real attraction for both of us, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Always nice to know what the real attraction
is.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy
Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family
wouldn’t tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …who is American, educated, well- spoken, a
flyer, preferably physically attractive…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Why would that matter?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because she wants the world to pay
attention. And pretty girls command more attention.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Was that your advice?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure. My role is selling this event to the
public. There will be a contract for the girl’s story with the New York
Times. Also a book to be published over her name.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: But all the money from these will go to
Mrs. Guest.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Except for the part that goes to you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Which will be as great as I can manage, I
assure you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You said she wants a flyer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t get your hopes up. The celebrated
Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There’ll be a male co- pilot and
navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s good for your chances. Because your
level of flying experience wouldn’t place you anywhere near the group
that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at
all.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Why would anyone want a book from a
passenger?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because the hook is that we’re making the
woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under
her direction and control. It’s her ship, her flight.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Good for my chances, you said. What are my
chan…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The job’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I chose you the moment you walked through
the door.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now assuming my awful manners haven’t soured
you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You’re a busy man, Mr. Putnam. I can find my
way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I honestly feel an apology is in order.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Fine. What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I didn’t mind waiting. Caught up on my
reading. Knitted a sweater.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I mean an apology. For what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to be pretty controlling these
next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public.
It’s all part of the package we’re selling.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s right. If you’re not in there selling
with me, it won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re the star. I’m no one at all.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Spoken like a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for
my ticket.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Courage is the price that life exacts For
granting peace</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The soul that knows it not Knows no release
From little things</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: As the little red airplane passed by, it
said something to me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever stopped
listening.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: Ten years, 28 jobs and an unspeak- able
number of crashes later, I hadn’t changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I even had my own plane. Bought with my last
dime.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Course in the early days of flying…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …crashing was so common, you almost forgot
it could kill you…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …until it did.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Got it. I think.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Two are blind. Amelia sees Sam…</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: Girls, this is Mr. Samuel Chapman. Sam, say
hullo to the Octopus Club.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You’re just in time. Alice has come through
the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They are, actually.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And it’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Has to be. Competition, you know.
Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you,
he’d have me publicly flogged.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So long as he could sell tickets.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And no one else knows.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Marion. She’s giving me a leave of
absence.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I would think so. Your name will be in all the
papers, and not just Boston. Denison House stands to come in for
funding, national attention.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Specially if I don’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t joke about that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ll make it. And then you’ll have
opportunities to work in aviation. Anywhere you want.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, I’ll have impressive credentials as a
long-distance passenger. That’s not exactly a career in aviation.</p>
<p><strong>i amelia</strong>: ’m not going anywhere, social work is my
life. After all the years of false starts, I found the thing I’m meant
to do.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And where does that leave us?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You do love to look on the dark side.
Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s not as if I’d been putting pressure on
you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What love means to you. What it requires. Is
the pressure.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I love you. Is that such a terrible
problem?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The problem is what it’s always been. The
problem is me.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, about
to become the first female to fly the Atlantic in the wake of
Lindbergh’s historic journey, regales an eager world press…</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Okay, boys. I’ll take any questions you wanna
throw my way. Except about what’s behind this sweater.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: The story. Behind it. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd’s
favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never
affected his work.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: When he said it, I must have had a funny
look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.’</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Boys, I’d like to introduce your commander,
Miss Amelia Earhart.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We felt
<code>commander' was less grandiose than, say,</code>empress.’</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And Bill Stultz here, simply the most
talented pilot working.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ve got Byrd’s pilot, we’ve got his
plane…</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: ou mean the Admiral flies on those?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nope, those are new, personally suggested by
the old man himself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This way, if you’re forced down at sea, you
can wait for a rescue.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hmmn. What does that do to our fuel?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Costs us at least 400 gallons. Don’t bother
bringing clothes for Paris, we’ll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in
Ireland. Real lucky.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut
our range by 200 miles.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to
estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to
fly without petrol.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t go blaming the bookseller. He’s been all
through this with Mrs. Guest, but she worships the Admiral. And it’s
money that puts planes in the air.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not
that I’ve ever had enough to try.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sorry. I’ll try keeping my mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What I ought to try. Is listening to you
once in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e meant that. And she seems oddly touched.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Careful. I could get to like it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Simpkin.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s in a book. Oh, that’s right. You read
the ones you publish.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: There’s a Beatrix Potter story about a cat
named Simpkin.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He wasn’t happy unless he had several mice,
each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: THe illusion of activity was essential for
him to feel at peace.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What are you boys doing over there?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Trying to make you look like a girl.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: I wondered. Was I Mr. Putnam’s 43rd mouse? Or
his 307th.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: he more we can make you look like a girl, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Oh god, is it worth the effort?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wondering who should play you in the film of
all this. I’m thinking Chaplin.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Valentino’s not available?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Two things. One, Chaplin can’t play me
because he’s perfect for you. And two, you have company.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney
Putnam.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Great to meet you. George talks so much
about you. In fact, lately, you’re all he does talk about.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hold those smiles for one more,
please.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my
sis. You know. In case.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m honored. That you’d leave these with
me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Who else? If I do pop off, it’s your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll call them once you’re safely on your
way.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sam will handle that. They trust him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve figured out the Simpkin thing, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Have you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure. There are so few books I haven’t
published, it was easy to find.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of Gloucester.
He’s a cat in a green frock coat.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But why is he you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s brilliant, charismatic…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So you haven’t actually read it. Do you
actually read?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …neurotic, compulsive, manipulative. Am I
getting warmer?</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: ray I make it. Or the secret pops off with
me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Our first hop was to Canada, to start from
as close as we could get to Ireland. Just in case we couldn’t get the
thing in the air and had to row.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The fuel was going to be so close, every
single mile counted.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: George told me to keep to my room, just in
case there was a reporter or two somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hi there, boys. How are the ham and
eggs?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t blame us, lady. I think somebody’s
starting to sell books.</p>
<p><strong>atlantic hop.</strong>: There beneath the headline, the
glamorous PHOTO we watched being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady
Lindy. Next to it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social
worker.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: melia is sifting through the other papers,
grinning and shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>eporter</strong>: Say, Amelia. What have you got for Mabel
Boll to chew on?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a
thought to someone like me? I don’t have a single sweater made out of
gold.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hey, not even silver.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The ham’s a little tough, Commander. But the
bacon’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll,
upstaged by upstart social worker, seems madder than a rich wet hen. Hey
Mabel, tell us about your rival!</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Well, how would any woman feel about some
tart who steals her man?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Bill Stultz and I were going to make history
together, until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy, oh
excuse me, `publisher,’ started throwing money and I don’t know what
else at him.</p>
<p><strong>eporter</strong>: Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used
her feminine charms on your pilot?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: I don’t know, Charlie, I never seen her. Has
she got any?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Well, she had to use something on somebody to
get from nowhere to here. You figure it out, or wait til George Putnam
feeds it to you.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: We’re going to Canada, waiting for some good
weather on the Atlantic, and then we’ll kick Little Miss Whoozis in the
keester.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What makes you so cocky that she won’t
leave first?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to
China. That thing they’re flying can’t load enough gas to make Yonkers.
Tell that to Putnam’s girlie. And while you’re at it…</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Tell her I do wear silver. So I’m two up on
her.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Eleven days of failure for plucky Amelia
Earhart and her crew. If it isn’t storms over the Atlantic, it’s the
inability of the seaplane’s pontoons to lift from the sea.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ERIES OF ANGLES. One failed take-off after
another.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Perhaps it’s for the best. Remember, no
woman has beat the jinx of the Atlantic and three have died trying.
Including a princess and the niece of former President Woodrow
Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Maybe this one’s not to be. Hey, Mabel!
How’s your weather report?</p>
<p><strong>continue.</strong>: Amelia looks down from her charts. Her
mind going to…</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: er FATHER climbs slowly from the car, WOBBLES his
way across the lawn. The kids part to let him through, the confusion and
disappointment on every face. He ignores them all, even Amelia. The
front door opens… …Amelia’s MOTHER gazes at him with shame and disdain.
As she helps him stagger inside…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Christ, what time is…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we’re
going now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where’s the weather report?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Great. Maybe Mabel will think so, too.
Because if she doesn’t, she’s going to Paris and you’re going home.
Today.</p>
<p><strong>ill</strong>: It’s not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s fine, there’s a tail wind all the way,
we’ll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind
gets us to Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ve had better than this and we haven’t
gone.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But this is the day Mabel’s ready, so we’re
going now. The weather is going to get better and we’ll be there to
enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Just as serious as you’re hung over. You go
now, get the late weather, we’ll meet you at the plane.</p>
<p>****: Slim, get out. I’ve got this.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ve loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He is the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy
I’ll ever know. He’s my father.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He’s a drunk. And he’s let me down all my
life.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Now you get out of that bed. And you fly
that god-damned thing to Ireland. Or I swear to you, Bill…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I swear to you I will. Or die trying.</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: ou got that? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And either way. You’re going to be living
with it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Good. Slim, start the engines.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You signed a contract. You’ve got a direct
instruction from me to go. That report indicates some degree of risk and
it’s a risk I’m taking.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Have a nice flight.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>slim</strong>: Hey, I’m scared shitless of this dame.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Read tomorrow’s papers, Bill. We’ll both be
in them.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So, to take off, you pull back on the thing,
right?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: osses his coffee. Climbs aboard.</p>
<p><strong>join the party!</strong>: He never turns to her, but she
studies him. Is he impaired or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox
from beneath his seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the
box… …there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey. She
stares at it as we SNAP TO…</p>
<p><strong>hold onto something for chrissake!</strong>: She GRABS the
leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down. Stares out the
window, wondering if she’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand
adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know
that. I have no faith we’ll meet anywhere again, but I wish we
might.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: melia SCRAWLS a note, ties it to an ORANGE from
her flight bag, and crawls back to the boys.</p>
<p><strong>how far to land?</strong>: The boys are studying the
freighter.</p>
<p><strong>ireland is.</strong>: Checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>probably less.</strong>: She shows him the note and the
orange.</p>
<p><strong>western union, special delivery.</strong>: Bill has to smile.
Are you serious? As a heart attack. Okay, he tries to get closer to the
ship, but we’re jerked and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia… …DROPS
the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy winds CARRY it two
hundred yards WIDE of the mark. Our three stare grimly.</p>
<p><strong>rescue.</strong>: Their eyes are locked.</p>
<p><strong>hold us up in this kind of sea?</strong>: She’s been
wondering the same.</p>
<p><strong>not on this occasion.</strong>: A rare smile…</p>
<p><strong>well, then.</strong>: And SWOOPS back on course. Amelia’s
hand squeezes his shoulder. DISSOLVE TO… LATER. Amelia crouched behind
Bill’s seat. Fog starting to break up.</p>
<p><strong>eighteen minutes ago. why?</strong>: She glances over to
Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich. She can’t believe this. He
takes a healthy bite.</p>
<p><strong>for denial.</strong>: She crawls back to the navigation
table. As she looks out her window, a SANDWICH SAILS past! She WHIPS
around…Slim’s arms raised in jubilation. Down below… Land.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Out of gas. May have to swim for</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there’s Railey.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Oh, yeh. Very important man. More important
than any of us.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He says ya mustn’t come ashore til he gets
here. No matter what.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Some kind of royalty, is he?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Public relations.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sorry Ma’am. Shoulda brought more men.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, really, this is very sweet, it’s an
honor. I’m actually enjoying it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Because you’re stuck with it. From here
on.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hullo, Hilton.</p>
<p><strong>ailey</strong>: Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond of the New
York Times.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I believe you’ve come for these.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: A whirlwind week for Boston’s Amelia
Earhart, our own Lady Lindy. Races at Ascot on Gold Cup day…watching
Helen Wills Moody play at Wimbledon…Lady Astor’s</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I was a passenger on this journey. Just a
passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by
Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: But you can fly, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: This flight was solely to the credit of Bill
and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo
flying and once held the women’s altitude record.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: So you could have done it yourself!</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: This particular flight, under these
conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off.
But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully,
as professionally as any man.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And
if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I hear your doubt. That doubt is our
challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight
by a woman can help…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It starts women thinking.</p>
<p><strong>uperimpose: new york city</strong>: Amelia sits in an open
car between Bill and Slim, WAVING to everyone. In the front seat, George
and Dorothy share the moment.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Guess you can burn those letters.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I saved them for your book.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The book’s yours. The letters are mine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ou’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hey, that’s my job. Do you think there’s
enough of him to boss for the two of us?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Barely enough for one.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing
about your future plans?</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he likes this question. Fixes the man with that
clear, honest gaze.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, being a social worker by trade and
passion, I’ll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun
is over.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …if I haven’t been fired.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social worker
like Miss Earhart become comfortable as a celebrity so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The truth is, she was a celebrity on smaller
stages all her life.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So they took me home with them to Rye. And I
lived there, while I wrote my book.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: NGLE. Amelia writing, looking up to see George
coming down the back porch steps to the garden.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I thought he’d be a tyrant and that I would
have to manage him.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Instead he was kind and generous. And only
picked the fights he needed to win.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lucky Strike endorsement. I wrote the copy
myself.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What does it say? `I don’t smoke but you
should?’</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It says Lucky Strikes were the only
cigarettes aboard the Friendship. That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: True and misleading. Why would I sign
that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So Bill and Slim get paid.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If you’re too proud to take tobacco money,
donate it to Byrd’s expedition, and we get great publicity.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This week’s marriage proposals. The top
one’s the most creative. It’s from Sing Sing. `…in the prison yard, so
everyone can watch and share in our…’</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You make her work for nothing. At least you
can feed her. Are you done yet? If not, make him write the rest, he will
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The lecture and publicity schedule was
fierce. I was with her pretty much all the time.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This was the moment of opportunity. Could we
launch her into Lindbergh status as a permanent icon, before her name
fell out of the news- papers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We had separate agendas. For her, it was the
advancement of aviation and of women.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: As for me, I liked to tell myself it was
about the money. Though there was never much of that left over.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really, it was about the chance to be around
her. This will never do, A.E., simply unacceptable. You need more
ammunition in these cards, and where’s the goddamned humor, for
Chrissake? By which I mean something actually funny! And please remember
not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your
pointer, it’s your face they’re paying to see. Well, most of them.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I remember the first kiss.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Of course, I knew all the stories</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hat Dorothy had been having a</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But I didn’t kiss him because I felt sorry
for him. Or because it would mean the world to him.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I did it. Because I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s so good to meet you. I’ve been
following your career with a great deal of admiration.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Um. Thanks, and. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Feel like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Amelia! What would her mother say?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Relax, George. I meant a Coke.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: ATER. Tea in the sitting room. Elinor leaning
forward, guileless, eager…</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: They’re saying you get $500 a week on the
lecture circuit.</p>
<p><strong>george amelia</strong>: On a bad week. On a good week.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: All depends. On whether you want the sell or
the real.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Oh, I don’t underestimate the value of
selling. It’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record,
then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East
River. You don’t seem to need much help selling yourself.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was hoping you
could do to me what you’ve done to her.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: What I mean is. It’s a good thing. That’s
why I want it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just so we’re clear, young lady. What is
your primary ambition? To take Amelia’s place as the number one female
pilot.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, good for you! I would have expected
nothing less. You want a tip?</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Keep doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: And don’t let anyone turn you around.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lovely party, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Depends on your point of view. I’ve been
listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, in that case, for your information, it
is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s not so much that my husband is having
an affair with his meal ticket. It’s just a pity we can’t have one
honest conversation about it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s wrong with this one? A promising
start, I’d say, in the honesty department.</p>
<p><strong>orothy</strong>: If this is what you call an honest talk, I’d
say you need some practice.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Great. Let’s try one about you and Fred
Upton.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I’m waiting for our practice
conversation. Hoping I’ll learn something. About honesty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dorothy and I are through.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: For a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s different now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Marry me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If you give it a chance, you’ll learn to
love me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I already love you. That’s why I can’t marry
you. Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were
stuck for an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he comes close enough to kiss.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I know me. And you don’t. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What if I promise not to learn?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The day will come. When I will run away. And
when it does…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If you love me. I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Race you to bed.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely
competitors say hello to the press announcing the First Women’s Air
Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers `the
Powder Puff Derby,’ these gals certainly know how to capture our
attention.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Wish I was important enough for you to
manage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I’ve just got one client. And most
days she’s more than I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Get in line behind the boys she smacked
around on the Derby.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Some of the gal flyers had their doubts
about her…well, her skill level. But she’s everyone’s champion now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And both of those things. Are the</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think it would be huge for women flyers if
Amelia won the Derby. The publicity would put the race, and all of you,
up there with the boys.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: I’m not sure she has much of a chance,
Mr. Putnam.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, the one shot would be putting her in a
far more powerful plane than anything she’s flown. We’re thinking the
Lockheed Vega.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Sir, I’ve test piloted the Vega. It’s way
more than she could ever handle. It wouldn’t be safe, let alone
successful.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s why I’m thinking of you flying with
her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits,
and I’d pay you $75 a week.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Well, I think that’s the most generous
opportunity I’ve ever been offered.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s just one thing. Obviously, it has to
appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken,
you’ll stand off to one side.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: In that case, I’ll get my own plane and win
the race myself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You haven’t changed.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: o smile at all.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Unfortunately for you, neither have I.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You can’t win if you can’t get a plane to
enter. Let me predict that you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In fact. If you reject my generosity, you
may come to regret it. For a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: That’s a threat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And
this is what my loyalty requires.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: She’s the one who said I shouldn’t let
anybody turn me around.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She probably meant me.</p>
<p><strong>elinor</strong>: Obviously, she doesn’t see me as a
threat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, sure she does.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She just doesn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My job. Is to care for her.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: hat’s wrong? What could be wrong? I had such a
lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: he told you that I shut her out of the
Derby. And that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And when were you going to tell me? Never. I
knew you’d go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What? You think I wanted it done, but just
let you do the dirty work?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Because I’m no angel. Business is
competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you’re
there making this life happen for me, but…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ou’re making your life hap…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But this is different.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If women are going to stab women in the
back, then women are going nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: rom here on, I’ll just stab men in he back.
A</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: You didn’t do this for business, anyway.
G</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: I did it for fun?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You did it because you love me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And when we’re married, you mustn’t
ever…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What’s the big shock? I thought you wanted
to get married.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: did. I do.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, then.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about what you said? The day</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You’ll be destroyed. And part of me will,
too. And I think we both know it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sometimes things happen that way. You’re not
better safe than sorry.</p>
<p><strong>uperimpose: wedding day. connecticut, 1931.</strong>: …her
eyes are swimming with tears. She brushes at them. Stares down at her
work. Continues. ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a
small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia beckons George.
The letter is in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …I want you to understand I shall not hold
you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider
myself bound to you similarly.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If we can be honest I think the difficulties
which may arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested
deeply, or in passing, with anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Please let us not interfere with the other’s
work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or
disagreements.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: must exact a cruel promise. And</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I will try to do my best in every way. And
give you that part of me you know and seem to want.</p>

Beautiful in her honesty.</p>

And we’re reading</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: this, because…?</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: I might fly to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Which is actually across the Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hence, the article.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m thinking of doing it solo.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not at all. When would you like to go?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m surprised you’re all right with
this…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five
years since Lindbergh, no one’s made it solo, so many of them died.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ell, they were only men. This is
different.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I was waiting to hear that I’m only doing
this because I was just a passenger last time, and I’d rather die than
go on living as a fraud..</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil…</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: But you don’t think that, do you, ear?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Of course not. But if I did…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …all the more reason to say yes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your
toe. It’s good luck.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Anyway. That’s what the elephant told
me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I think luck has rules. And I try to respect
them. My favorite is…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We make our own luck, you and I. Remember
that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you have money?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: All this? G</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thank god, I thought you were going to tear
it in half.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I spent our money on ocean liner passage to
go bring you back. It’s non-refundable. So try to do your part.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So the Simpkin thing. What was all that?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I put it in a letter. Which you’ll get if I
don’t make it. So…mixed emotions, huh? Either way, something to look
forward to.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The weather report wasn’t perfect. But we
knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five
years to the day from Lindbergh’s flight. It was too good a sell for
George to resist.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …was that my altimeter would conk out. Never
to return.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The only way to have any sense of altitude,
was to keep dropping toward the sea.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I was too busy to grasp how impossible the
situation had become. The joke was…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: All those months flying only with
instruments, I should have been practicing without them.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I started to wonder if luck was paying me
back. For thinking I knew the rules.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Then I smelled burning oil.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: A bad weld, already a small flame. It would
be hours back to Canada, trying to find an unlit field, landing with a
heavy fuel load.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I told myself, push on. After all, if it was
a stupid choice…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …no one would ever know.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: With seemingly no warning, there was ice.
The controls froze.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Through the spin I had one thought, it would
be warmer lower, the ice would melt, I just had to regain control…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …before I hit the water.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …or passed out.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The ice happened twice more, and I began to
lose heart. Then I remembered Lindbergh’s book saying the same thing
happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he sea DISAPPEARS below. Only cloud.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So I figured, if he’s twice as good, I just
have to be twice as lucky…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to…</strong>: HOURS LATER. Amelia seriously
fatigued. She breaks through cloud into DAZZLING SUNLIGHT, and blinks,
blinded.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’d read that part in George’s reception
room that first day. Bless him for keeping me waiting.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The cockpit gauge was defective. There was a
steady trickle of fuel down my neck.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Toss-up whether the bigger danger was
running out of gas or going up in a fireball. I had my answer in less
than an hour, when…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to…</strong>: LATER. Amelia beyond exhaustion.
Staring fixedly at some- thing we can’t see. Until we PAN through the
wind screen to the leak in the manifold weld. The BLUE FLAME is
startlingly LARGER, now LICKING its way along the surface of the
fuselage…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The manifold weld began to separate. I
gauged the likelihood of explosion at somewhere between probable and
inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Putnam? Line three. Putnam.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sir, this is Douglas McGuire of the Press
Association. I’m sorry to tell you that Miss Earhart’s plane has crashed
in a field, short of Le Bourget airport.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: If the crash is as reported, sir, I’m
afraid not. There were terrible flames.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are they completely sure it’s her plane?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Yes sir, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: In Gallagher’s pasture.</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: ne more beat.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where are ya supposed to be?</p>

missed, y’know.</p>

<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Amelia Earhart arrives to a tumul- tuous
New York reception after her whirlwind tour of Europe, in which our
Queen of the Skies danced with her royal counterpart the Prince of
Wales, before meeting both Benito Mussolini and the Pope.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The second human to fly the Atlantic
solo, she is the only one ever to fly it twice. And she set the record,
man or woman, for the fastest crossing. Fourteen hours 54 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Now it’s America’s turn to show our girl
what we think of her!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ell, I’m glad someone besides me finally
noticed. `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics,
trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break
she just managed to make the hop.’</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: hy would you even read that garbage?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the
men of this world. Keeps me humble.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ood. And remembering how little you owe me
keeps me humble.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s a crackpot. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Cheer up. They’re crazy about you. Well,
they’re crazy about something.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What have we really done?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve made them feel like this.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: That’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Most of them are women. And for them, it’s
very much enough.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The World Telegram said, `a magnificent
display of useless courage.’</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The question is. Can any magnif- icent
display of courage be use- less? A</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: The point is. Men do it every day. And no one
throws a parade.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: One day closer, then. To the day when they
won’t think to throw one for you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of
useless courage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And. It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>president of the united states.</strong>: HAIL TO THE CHIEF

Amelia’s outfit, touching her hair, as he did long ago on the Copley
Hotel roof.</p>

<p><strong>george</strong>: If a bomb goes off tonight, the whole
government of the United States is out there…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Some dog catcher will have to become
President.</p>
<p><strong>until tonight.</strong>: GEORGE</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Ladies.</p>
<p><strong>m george</strong>: iss.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The irony is, I’d finally put that wedding
day letter out of my mind. Stopped watching every beautiful accomplished
man who crossed her path.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I had a call from the Byrds. They’ve asked
us to dinner Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thursday, I’ll be in Boston. Meeting Gene
Vidal and Paul Collins.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t tell me Gene wants to resurrect
Transcontinental?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, he’s starting a shuttle service.
Washington, New York, Boston…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Could be a money maker for us. Get me off
the lecture grind.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gene’s a dashing guy. He could talk anyone
into anything.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ounds like a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Transcontinental was too ambitious. Too many
hops, too tough on the ladies. But the shuttle…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Washington, New York, Boston. I think it’s the
future. Will you go there with us?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What on earth would you need me for?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hasn’t George taught you anything? Lady Lindy,
the queen of the air, the best known woman in the entire U.S. of A?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gene on the poster with you. Legendary athlete
at West Point, two events in the Olympics, a top pilot who should be
running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins…</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: Oh. She starts eating…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to…</strong>: LATER. Paul has gone. Gene and Amelia
are at the bar, huddled over his beer and her Coke.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Gene had a terrible marriage and was
separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife. But he was too kind to
humiliate her with a divorce…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: As a result, he was basically a single
parent to their young son, Gore.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m rattling on here, and you’ve got a morning
train.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How’s Nina doing?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Oh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Actually, she hasn’t been feeling her best.
She’ll probably summer in Newport. So my kid’s stuck with Dad again.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If you two get bored, I could tag along
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You suggesting you’re less boring than I
am?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, yeh.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have
you boys in stitches.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Gore would love that. He has a little crush,
I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: At seven?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: He’s eight.</p>
<p><strong>ene</strong>: Listen, Paul and I would be thrilled to rope
you into our shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Are you kidding, it’s a godsend. No matter
how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there’s never
enough money for the next adventure.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The next adventure. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Because we’re running out of oceans.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Wish you’d do something about that.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m serious, Amelia.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I know. Always.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The only way you can stay where you are. And
be who you are…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Is to keep feeding the beast.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: And the beast always needs something larger,
greater, more daring… He costs money, too.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The price of fame, literally. Do you and
George talk about this?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: With all respect. Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>k</strong>: isses his mouth. His eyes question.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: For understanding.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: After Roosevelt won, his wife Eleanor
brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning
success.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in he Winter
Olympics, spent hours each morning on horseback, and carried a pistol on
car trips. She possessed boundless energy, a towering intellect…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …and was Amelia’s idol. As it happened, she
was obsessed with flying, making Amelia her absolute heroine. A</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: So he hasn’t actually forbidden you.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Franklin doesn’t forbid. He just feels it’s
a waste of my valuable ime to learn. Since I can’t afford to buy a
plane.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The wrong Roosevelt got elected.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: And it will take at least four years to
correct the mistake.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I did ask about aviation, but he hasn’t
decided on the structure yet. It might be under the Bureau f
Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I think the structure may be less important
than the man chosen to run it.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: My hearing is failing. I missed the words
<code>or woman,' which you undoubtedly added after, or per- haps before, the word</code>man.’</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: his could be one of those rare instances.
When the most accomplished candidate. Turns out to be male.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: How exciting. I love finding the exception
that proves the rule. Is t a name I know?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How do you feel about flying at night?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I’ve never done it. Franklin finds t
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s dual controls. No one will ever
know.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Don’t you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I feel like a Coke. Can I get you
something?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Do try not to hit the ground.</p>
<p><strong>roosevelt</strong>: Today, we proudly announce an appointment
critical to America’s commerce, and to its role as technology’s leader
in the Twentieth Century.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: ene Vidal is an obvious and perfect choice as our
first Director of Commerce’s Aeronautics Branch. His extraordinary
credentials include…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Have I told you what a perfect job ou did on
the peonies? They’re miraculous.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s all right. You’ve been distracted
lately.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: Listen, I’ve put together a month n Europe.
Close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thing is. I’d like you to come.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I don’t really see how I can.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve talked to the promoters, they’ll switch
some lecture dates for us.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, it’s not just that. There’s y work on
the shuttle, we’re at a critical stage, and…I’ve just started as Gene’s
consultant at the Aeronautics Branch…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Normally, I’d be worried about leaving you
here alone. But I suppose that won’t be a problem, will it?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think I’ve just said it. Is there anything
you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I can’t think of anything helpful.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e disappears into the house. She’s still
staring.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Los Angeles, California. The Tenth
Olympics of the modern era kick off, as movie stars mingle with ordinary
Joes.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Here’s the gold medal run of the world’s
best woman athlete, abe Didrickson. Cheered on by the most celebrated
woman of today…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …that’s right, Amelia Earhart. Hollywood
glamor, American winners, and wait til our boys warm up for their
action.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: By this time, I had a side job as chairman of
the editorial board of Paramount Pictures. So Amelia and I bought a
little place in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: She was out there, preparing for a flight,
when our home in Rye burned to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We both cried when I called to tell her. She
asked to come be with me. But I insisted she stay there, to keep on
schedule for her flight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So many treasures lost. Letters and poems
she’d written. I poured through the rubble…</p>
<p>****: Yeh. What’s today been like? You still okay?</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: I found something you’d written.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: EORGE GEORGE</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thank you for writing that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Even though I’d never seen it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I suppose I thought. It was too revealing.
I’m so glad you have it now.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: in now for a landing. Smooth trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>nnouncer</strong>: The odyssey began in Honolulu when he
became the first person, man or woman, to fly solo over half the Pacific
to California.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Then, the first human to solo from
California to Mexico City. Followed by her daring solo across the Gulf.
As she passed over Washington, D.C., she eclipsed the time of a certain
previous flight, from 27 hours to 13 hours.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The pilot of that previous flight? Some
guy named Lindbergh.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: If you don’t drink, why do you come o
bars?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Must be the ambience. And the nuts.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What worries me is, in some of these bars the
nuts are the ambience. Specially when they make a pass at you.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he chews, staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Any guy would have to be nuts to do that.
I’m considerable trouble, if you haven’t noticed.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You keep advertising that, but I’m still
waiting to see it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You’ll see it.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Well, here’s your chance. I’m taking Gore to
the conference in Bermuda. He wants you to come.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Gore, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Sure. I’m completely indifferent.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Would make life simpler.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Actually, I’ll be in Indiana. Edward Elliot
of Purdue wants</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll be back and forth. When I’m there, I’ve
asked to stay in the dorm with the girls.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: That’s a wonderful idea. Especially now.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What’s special about now?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: A good time for some positive press about you
as a role model.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You don’t read the papers?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Not unless someone makes me.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Well, someone should. Because they’re all
saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose
except publicity. Meaning, money.</p>
<p><strong>ene</strong>: They also harp on a growing list of products
that you commercially endorse.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How thoughtless of me to be doing ll this in
a society where no one else is interested in making money. Present
company included.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Look, George had you taking money rom the
sugar cartel for the Hawaii flight, the Mexican Government for theirs,
he’s selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If this is about George, just say o. Because
we made those calls, nd we includes me.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’m sorry I said it that way. This s actually
about you, because I’m picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for
the benefit of someone I care about.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And what’s your point? Women are eld to some
higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for
succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? Of
course they are.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, let’s change that, shall we? r would
you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: If you want to make money, my guess s that
people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America’s Sweetheart of the Skies, the
wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Thanks for not being defensive.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, I’m an open-minded girl. And o prove
it, I’m hereby resigning as your consultant at the</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The public linking of our names does more
harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Next time you read the papers. Try reading
between the lines.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I came to Washington today with the National
Women’s Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia
Mott Amendment for equal rights.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And that’s because I haven’t needed it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m the lucky one. Our Department of
Commerce shows no prejudice in issuing licenses to fly. A pilot is a
pilot.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How about giving the rest of our women. The
ones who can be productive for their families and for our nation an
equal break?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They are your sisters and your daughters.
They are your wives. And fellas…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You’ve no excuse. And you know it.</p>
<p><strong>co-ed</strong>: Okay, it’s all well and good to tell us to
study whatever we want, and work at whatever we want, and not give a
darn about what the world of men think…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …including them wanting us to say darn
instead of damn.</p>
<p><strong>co-ed</strong>: But what about those of us who are getting
married when we graduate? What advice do you have for us?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Build your career first. And, surprisingly,
that’s the best thing you can do for your eventual marriage.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Look. It starts with a strong sexual
attraction, that the oman assumes must be love.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Everything works until the first financial
crisis jars the man’s confidence and threatens the oman’s security.
Why…?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Because she can’t help. All she can be is
dependent. Because that</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: s what she’s been trained to be.</p>
<p>****: He says he’s the man in your life.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Trust me. Only a husband talks like that.
Yes? Yes. Yes…</p>
<p>****: They love when we say `yes.’</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m flying in Tuesday. Yes, of course, I’ll
make time.</p>
<p>****: Me, too.</p>
<p>****: Me, too. Thanks for the roses.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Can you women keep a secret?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, it’s no secret that I’m a bit driven,
some might say obsessive, about my little flying adven- tures…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ve decided to embark on easily the most
exciting, possibly cra- ziest, ever…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m going to fly. Around the world.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Are you going to tell me your surprise, or
do I have to get physical?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Boy, that is the last thing I’d want.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I only thought that if you’re serious about
this around-the-world nonsense. It might be handy to have a plane to fly
in.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Except it would have to be an Electra, and
they cost…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …$36,000. After a generous discount from
Lockheed.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: May as well be a billion.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …not to mention at least another 36 to get
it modified and ready.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And your surprise is, you robbed a bank.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Actually. A university.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create
an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And
suggested a budget item of…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying
laboratory.’</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: to startle passersby. It only makes him
chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: As I said, I’ve sort of persuaded Ed. There
are a bunch of trustees and donors, tho. We have to get them on
board.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Think I could help?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: By the way. That’s not the surprise. Merry
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Can’t wait to see what you got me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Cat food. A whole case.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you
and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The
chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: s she writes, DISSOLVE TO…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: As President Elliot has said, it would be a
shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful
to the program here at Purdue.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It is much more. I believe that women should
do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have
not.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: This might encourage other women toward
greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you
gentlemen desire that.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I know, of course, from my chats earlier in
the evening. With each of your wives.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: In that spirit, I want each of you to reach
for your checkbooks…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I mean that quite literally. This is an
opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: eorge and Amelia gaze at each other.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The capacity. To be relentless.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: So you’d be the first one, right? ou always
like that.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: To fly around the world.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, there’s Magellan, 400 years go.
Actually, he didn’t make it. And he died. And he used a boat.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: So it’s almost the same, except it’s
completely different.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: There are men who say they flew around the
world, but they didn’t ly around all of it.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Because at higher latitudes, it’s ou just spin
in a circle and you’ve gone around the world.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So why are you asking? Just to show how
smart you are?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>ore</strong>: The only way to really fly around he world is
to fly the entire circumference of 27,000 miles. Like at the
equator.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No one’s tried it. You think I should?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Dare me.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range
of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land est of Honolulu is
farther than that.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll have to refuel.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: In the air. One plane to another.</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: You’re really going to do all this, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, don’t you think I can?</p>
<p><strong>gore</strong>: I guess we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she’ll
take you for an ice cream. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We’ll play some cards before you leave.</p>
<p><strong>ene</strong>: You can’t refuel in the air.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: s that an opinion or an order?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: The only good thing about losing our former
relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you’re being
completely crazy.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Oh, I bet there are more advantages than
just that.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You’re not a good enough pilot to o mid-air
refueling. You will not be able to control the Electra or that docking
maneuver for that amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ve taken bigger risks.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’ve noticed. Don’t be so proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: This is Howland Island. It’s half- way between
Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it’s a mile wide
and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it
exists.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s your vacation home.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: We’re colonizing it, because when the Japanese
make their move, we’re going to need a refueling strip there.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Try reading the newspapers between he lines.
We haven’t started building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew
could get the President’s attention…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s really tiny, a grain of sand n the middle
of a thousand miles f nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: You’d need a first-class navigator can’t be
entirely solo.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Can you handle that?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Hullo, Fred. It’s good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I hear you like your coffee black.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: This time of day, I like it with bacon and
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Over easy on the eggs. Your job could depend
on it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are we sizing me up?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m told that mid-air refueling would be
beyond my abilities.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 0% you crash.
60% you don’t get he fuel, so you’re cooked anyway.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Better odds of hitting that island?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How do you feel about 100%?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Even with cloud cover?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ve crossed the Pacific by air 18 times. Pan
Am told you I’m the best celestial navigator they’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They did.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Someone else told you I have a drinking
problem. Which is a big art of why we’re here, yes?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Pan Am will tell you. Everyone I ver worked
for will tell you. Nothing’s interfered with my performance. Not
once.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his
soul.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You trusted Bill Stultz. That worked out. Rest
his soul.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Bill just had to find Europe. We’re looking
for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than
18 feet.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s what you’re looking for. I’m looking
for coordinates on a map. And if it doesn’t work…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Money-back guarantee. Hey. How can I lose?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Did I pressure the navy to build a landing
strip at Howland Island? How exactly would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: The airstrip has been planned for a long
time. I was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight.
The navy has been wonderful, as always.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Amelia, what do you say to the charges
that your husband is pulling the strings, pressuring you nto this
around-the-world flight o make a financial killing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wait a minute, you’re flying around the
world? Don’t you know a woman’s place is in the home??</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: George, why don’t you go along this
time? Watch over the little woman.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I begged to go. But it seems that between
185 pounds of husband and</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: At least, I think that’s what all he
laughter meant.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Experts are saying that this `flying
laboratory’ is a sham. There’s nothing to be learned for aviation, and
you’re just in this for the money.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Who am I to argue with `experts?’ I’ll just
give you my plain old common-sense thinking on this…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We may not learn much about the plane, but
we will about the pilot. Endurance over a month’s journey, flying nearly
every day. Response o stress, crises. I think that will make a
contribution.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m a working stiff like all of you. I don’t
apologize for the fact that I need money to live. And to keep financing
my flying, which is what I love. I think that’s a positive example for
women.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m not doing this as a scientist. I’m a
flyer, boys, pursuing my passion. For the fun of it. The fun of it.
Something I recommend as a healthy motive for women.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …and maybe even some men.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: luke field, honolulu. march 20, 1937.</strong>:
he waves goodbye to crew and press. Climbs the steps to be welcomed by
Fred’s hand gently pulling her aboard. The door CLOSES. We see Amelia
and Fred in the cockpit. He checks a gauge.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Lovely. We’ve got so much fuel we can’t
possibly get off the ground. Much safer than flying.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, we need enough for a third pass at
Howland. After you miss it the first couple times around.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We were, all of us, fearful about hat
landing. No one guessed…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …it would be the take-off.</p>
<p><strong>direction…</strong>: INTERCUT. Oakland Airport. George and
his retinue waiting. A phone RINGING. Someone takes the call, his face
freezes,</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Have you heard? They crashed, the ship’s in
flames.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Good reaction, cutting the switch. You saved
our ass.</p>
<p><strong>o one hurt!</strong>: George alone on the tarmac. Stops in
his tracks. Now he can cry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Three weeks, she’ll be good as new. It’s a
remarkable crew. The best</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hat…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …the best that money can buy. I just can’t
believe I’ve done this o us. All the money wasted that’s never coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You cut the engines. It would have cost a
bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I
should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: t’s only money, we’ll figure it out. We
always do.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll make it back and more, I promise. The
book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three
years.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe. Or…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are
going to double.</p>
<p>****: They thought I was competent. I meant. Or maybe we can
quit.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You mean after.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Or. Even now.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: So my exit would be a stupid crash. nd
withdrawing from a world- publicized attempt to finally do something no
man had done before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeh. That. And it would be fine ith me.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: But that’s because you’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lucky for you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And what if it’s not something I have to
show the world?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What if it’s something I have to show
me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Who let you off the hook on this?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Thanks for letting me come.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I guess I’m already outvoted.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’d outvote you all by herself. he does it
to me every day.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I don’t have a choice. I have to reverse my
route and fly east. If hurricanes in the Caribbean and monsoons in
Africa…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: But you’re flying Howland last, when you’re
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: Gene, this way our first leg is Oakland to
Miami. It’s a shakedown o make sure the plane is right. That’s
crucial.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Maybe I’m obsessing on Howland because it was
my bright idea, and I’d feel responsible if…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Well, if I do pop off, I’ll try to make it
somewhere that’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: I’d appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You miss that island. You’ll be out of fuel,
with 2000 miles to go.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: But I’ll have Fred so I won’t miss. In fact,
I’m taking Fred along for this whole trip.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You and Fred alone for a month…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If you’re worried about his drinking, I’ll
deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I can handle Fred.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tip-top. Every little girl needs a man
around. Even strong girls like ours, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She can handle us. She can handle Fred.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: And thanks for being here. You’ve always had
Amelia’s best interests t heart.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: And, for that. I’m grateful.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The legendary Amelia Earhart lands in
Miami, completing the first and easiest leg of her around-the-world
equatorial flight. A feat no man has ever attempted. That’s hubby George
with her, he gets off here.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: That handsome guy behind them isn’t a
movie star. Nope, it’s navigator Fred Noonan, who will be Amelia’s sole
companion on the exotic odyssey…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Hey, where does a guy go to apply for a
job like that?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll be flying sky no one’s ever been in.
You made that happen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hate to think where you’d be without me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’ll try to make you proud.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You did that long, long ago. Only ne person
left to prove yourself o. Just make sure you do it.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: beat. The doubt comes.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then the best part. The future. Oh yeh.
That.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The radio problems crept up on us ver
time.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The marine 500 kilocycle radio was left in
Oakland. Amelia said she</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The 250 foot trailing auxiliary antenna, she
would leave behind in Miami. Too heavy, not important.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then, suddenly our remaining radio ouldn’t
reach its designated frequencies. Pan Am hurriedly replaced the main
antennae. And we thought all was well.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Race you to California. I’ll go west. Five
bucks?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If you’ll fly the plane. Make it twenty.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Simpkin keeps many mice at one time. Each
under a different teacup.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re saying he’s cruel?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Controlling?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Insecure.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He needs the illusion of activity o feel
comfortable. That he’s preparing for all contingencies.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: That he has more irons in the</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: ire than anyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Especially the mice.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it’s all
about her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And one of them. Is right. She knows.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: want you to give me something.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tell me this is your last flight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Don’t you know I couldn’t? Even if part of
me wanted to. Very, very much.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How can we be anything. But what we are?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I do love you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I love you back.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: See ya.</p>

Tribune, with her BYLINE.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: dumdum airdrome, calcutta</strong>: The
buildings have thatched roofs. There are oxcarts by the runway,

all around them.</p>
<p><strong>lighter there.</strong>: He doesn’t move.</p>

and endless. Between us and the ground, a huge gathering of FLYING
SHAPES.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Black eagles. If one of those clips a
propeller. Or flies into the engine…</p>

you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: This is insane. It’s so extravagant.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It gets worse, I bought a brand-new suit and
tie. Got a date with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We can’t possibly afford this.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ure, we can. It’s Tuesday’s call o Lae that
we can’t afford. You hang up the phone this minute. You’ll bankrupt us
and I’ll have to walk home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: easoning with me. A magnificent display of
useless courage.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: ..and it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: A touching love story, really.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: An honest one. It’s what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I wonder if it’s honest enough for George. If
it’s what he wanted. ou know.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: If you mean Gene, we’re not together
anymore. In that way. Not for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Whose choice was that?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It was mine.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, isn’t it always? You choose in, you
choose out. Makes things easy.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Anything but easy. Are you disapproving of
the way I live?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hell, no. It’s just like me. In fact, it’s
like most guys I know.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Actually, I’d like a piece of it myself. Right
about now.</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: If you have a point, Fred. Make it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, I believe I have.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Allow me to cut you a deal, my friend.</p>

smoke…?</p>
<p><strong>balfour</strong>: I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: …or something?</p>
<p><strong>balfour</strong>: If you need help, I’ll be right outside. In
the rain.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Thank you. I’ll only be a moment.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: You should be sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You should be working.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m running a big adventure here, ’m a very
important fellow.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: You told me I was the star. And you were no
one at all. I thought I was lying. Guess the joke’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s Fred?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m mad at him. I’ll be in Honolulu on the
3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t keep me waiting.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I won’t dare. You’re a very important
feline. Uh, fellow.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Talk to me about Fred.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Fred is fine. He’s calculating head-wind
speed versus fuel as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You wouldn’t sell a salesman would you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So what’s that I hear in your voice?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is he drinking? I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Call it off. Right now. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I can handle it.</p>

<p><strong>george</strong>: For me? Anywhere you are.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m going to like it there.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’d better. Since this is my last
flight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well. If you insist.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: t’s late here. Guess I’ll go curl up under a
teacup.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll go tell the world you’re on your way.
Sweet dreams. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re finding the range. But it might be
easier to just shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Traveling light, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Got room for 190 pounds of asshole?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: a’am, I am so sor…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Everything is.</p>

the post for you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s for my husband. I’m going to hand it to
him. So I can watch his face as he reads it.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s our tradition.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ten A.M., Friday July 2. They lined up on
the thousand-yard runway. One thousand gallons of fuel, enough for 20 to
21 hours of flying.</p>
<p><strong>balfour</strong>: Mr. Putnam. Their headwinds are stronger
than they knew when they took off.</p>
<p><strong>balfour</strong>: I recalculated their fuel. It will cost
them 9%.</p>
<p><strong>balfour</strong>: I can’t raise them, sir. I tried voice, and
Morse Code…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: ire back. Tell him to forget the Morse Code.
They didn’t bring the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just tell him to stay with voice. He’ll get
them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca had been
anchored off Howland just for us.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Its radio would be her lifeline. Its black
plume of smoke would reach for miles. More visible than the island
itself.</p>
<p><strong>cipriani</strong>: The direction finder. How long has this
been on?</p>
<p><strong>uperimpose: 2:45 a.m.</strong>: Dalten adjusting the receiver
which is suddenly spitting STATIC. Threading through the noise, what
could be a human voice. Bellarts calls to O’Hare…</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: That’s her on 3105. She said `cloudy and
overcast.’</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 3:45 a.m.</strong>: Radio CRACKLES. All eyes
turn.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Itasca from Earhart. Overcast. We are
receiving your signal. Please acknowledge ours. What is your position?
When do you expect to arrive Howland?</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: Commander estimated 7:00. If she’s having
trouble on voice transmission, stay with Morse.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 6:45 a.m.</strong>: The radio. The static. The
sudden voice…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Please take bearing on us and report in half
hour. I will make noise in microphone. We are about 100 miles out.</p>
<p><strong>dalten</strong>: She’s got to stay on longer.</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: Earhart signal strength 4, but on</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: ir so briefly bearings impossible.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 7:18 a.m.</strong>: DALTEN</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 7:30 a.m.</strong>: DALTEN</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: Tommy, intercom top deck, double check the
smoke stack…</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: AERIAL ANGLE high above the ship. BLACK
SMOKE PLUMES into clear sky…</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: They should be able to see it for twenty
miles, at least.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be on you but
cannot see you…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you
by radio. We are flying t altitude 1000 feet. You are reaching us. We
are sending on 3105 and 500 constantly. Please acknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>uperimpose: 7:58 a.m.</strong>: The room has nearly filled.
COMMANDER THOMPSON stands at Bellart’s shoulder. All eyes fixed on the
radio…</p>
<p><strong>earhart</strong>: We are circling but cannot hear you. Go
ahead on 7500. Itasca to KHAQQ. Your signal is strong. Are you receiving
this?</p>
<p><strong>earhart</strong>: KHAQQ calling Itasca. We received your
signal, but unable to get a minimum. Please take bearing on us and
answer 3105 with voice. Your signal received okay. It is impractical to
take a bearing on 3105 on your voice. Give us a longer signal, please.
Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: You’ve got her signal, dammit. What about
the direction finder?</p>
<p><strong>bellarts</strong>: Cipriani reports the battery’s dead, sir.
It was left on all night. I don’t believe this is happening.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 8:12 a.m.</strong>: BELLARTS</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 8:33 a.m.</strong>: No breath in this room. No
one moves.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: 8:44 a.m.</strong>: Suddenly, a thin and anxious
VOICE cuts through a burst of static… A</p>
<p><strong>melia</strong>: We are on the line of position 157- 337, will
repeat this message on 6210 kilocycles. Wait, listening n 6210
kilocycles. We are running north and south.</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: Um. An hour. And two minutes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>eorge</strong>: Looking back, the questions were obvious. Why
would anyone try to ind such a tiny target in a vast ocean, with barely
an hour’s lee- way in fuel? Well, we’re most grateful. With such an
effort, of course they’ll e found.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I tortured myself. Why hadn’t And then I
realized…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If I tried to count the insane and reckless
chances she took from the first moment I met her. I wouldn’t know where
to begin.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It was the most tragic of endings. The most
cruel and senseless and wasteful. And yet…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s hard to imagine another.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: My Simpkin.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I want to be married to you. The way you’ve
been married to me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: As you read this. I am watching your
face.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I am hoping to see. That you know how much I
mean each word.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: All the things I never said, for so very
long…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Look up. They’re in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to black.</strong>: Hold.</p>
