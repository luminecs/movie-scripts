<h1 id="the-hospital">the-hospital</h1>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: On Monday morning, a patient named
Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was admitted to the hospital
complaining of chest pains.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: He had been referred by a nursing home
where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris. Now it
is axiomatic that nursing home doctors are always wrong.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey,
however, accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine, a drug suitable
for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema, which is,
unfortunately, what the old man actually had. Within an hour…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …the patient became unresponsive and
diaphoretic and was raced up to Intensive Care with an irregular pulse
of 150, blood pressure 90 over 60, respiration rapid and shallow.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The resident on duty now compounded the
blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema. He gave him
digitalis, diuretics and oxygen. This restored the old man’s color…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and he was sent back to his room in the
Holly Pavilion, ruddy complected and peacefully asleep.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In point of fact, the patient was in CO2
narcosis…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and died at seven-thirty that
evening.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I mention all this, only to explain how
the bed in Room 806 became available.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The intern involved was a prickly young
buck named Schaefer who had a good thing going for him with a technician
in the hematology lab. In the haphazard fashion of hospital romances,
Dr. Schaefer had been zapping this girl on wheelchairs, stretchers,
pantry shelves…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …in the kitchen, in the morgue, in the
dark corners of corridors…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …standing up, sitting down – so you can
imagine what an available bed meant to him.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Hey, Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. Hey
listen. I got us a bed for tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse’s p.o.v.</strong>: Intern Dr. Schaefer is lying on this
bed, rigid, eyes dilated, pupils staring unseeing. An I.V. tube sticks
out of his naked right arm. Nurse Perez doesn’t quite know what to make
of the fact that Dr. Schaefer is lying on that bed with an I.V. tube
sticking out of him looking dead. Frowning, she reaches out a tentative
hand to shake his naked shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Doctor Schaefer…</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Doctor Schaefer?</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Listen, did you know Doctor Schaefer
was in Eight-O-Six, because he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: continues her painstaking
paperwork,</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: I’m just telling you, Dr. Schaefer is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: What do you want, Perez?</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Look, I don’t know what the hell this
is all about, but Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806 with an I.V. running and
he’s dead. I didn’t even know he was sick.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: Perez, what the hell are you talking
about? Do you know what the hell she’s talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Well, maybe I’m going crazy. I don’t
know. Isn’t Room 806 the patient Guernsey? I mean, did something happen
I don’t know about?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: Perez, I don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: This is the nuttiest thing I ever saw.
Dr. Schaefer’s in Room 806 dead.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: What Dr. Schaefer? Our
Dr. Schaefer?</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: Our Dr. Schaefer. The one who’s always
grabbing everybody’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: Do you know what she’s talking about?
I don’t know what she’s talking about. What do you mean Doctor
Schaefer’s in Room 806 dead?</p>
<p><strong>nurse perez</strong>: I mean, he’s lying on the far bed,
stone dead, and with an I.V. tube sticking out of him. And if you don’t
believe me, maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. reardon</strong>: All right, maybe you’d better call
Mrs. Christie.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: This is Dr. Bock… Yes, Mrs. Christie, what is
it? It’s all right, I’d be getting up in a few minutes anyway… I’m sorry
I missed that. Would you say it again? Yes, I know him, Schaefer, the
stud with the glasses, who fancies the nurses… I’m afraid I don’t
understand that, what do you mean? Was he sick? I mean, was he… uh, what
was the cause of death? Was he being treated? I don’t understand. What
was he doing in the bed? You did say he… Look, Mrs. Christie, did you
call the office? Good, well, I’ll… No, no, it’s all right. I’ll be
getting my wake-up call any minute anyway.</p>
<p><strong>grumbling protesters</strong>: Two-four! Help the poor!</p>
<p><strong>dr. ives</strong>: What do you say, Sundstrom? How much
longer do you think our monopolistic, exclusionary, racist policies will
work?</p>
<p><strong>protester</strong>: We’re the hope!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: So how’s it going, Herb?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: One of my interns dropped dead this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Really? I’m sorry to hear that. I
understand you’ve moved out to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: It got that bad with Phyllis?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: It’s been that bad for twenty-four years. Are
you going to be solicitous?</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Listen, Herb, I’m the guy who brought you
into this hospital, so I think I can skip the diplomatic overtures.
Marty stopped me in the hall yesterday, very upset. He had just had
lunch with you and said you sounded suicidal. Marty tends to be
extravagant, but he’s not the only one. Jack Singer mentioned the other
day you’ve been boozing it up a lot. And let’s face it, you’ve been
sloughing off. I understand you haven’t even been doing rounds.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m going to do rounds today.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Herb, want a couple of days off?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Go down to Montego Bay, get drunk, get
laid, get a little sun.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: For God’s sake, John, I’m fifty-three years
old with all the attendant fears. I just left my wife after twenty-four
years. Standard case of menopausal melancholy.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Maybe you ought to have a talk with Joe
Einhorn.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I don’t want to see a psychiatrist. Stop
worrying about me. All I have to do is get my ass back to work, and I’ll
be fine. I’m sorry I’ve caused you concern.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Sid just called from St. Luke’s, and
he’s heard that the demonstrators up there are planning a march to join
the bunch down here.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Oh, God. Did you call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: They’re all in Eight-O-Six,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: I think I’ll just let Mrs. Christie
tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: I’ve seen some pretty good snafus, but
this one… I mean, there’s a certain splendor to this one. One of the
night nurses, a float, thought Schaefer was a patient and plugged an
I.V. into him. He was a diabetic, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What do you mean, a nurse plugged an I.V. into
him?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Oh, it’s really a screwed-up story,
Doctor. You see, what happened was we had an old man in that bed who
died last night, so the bed was available. And you know Schaefer. He’s
Sammy Stud.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And he talked a nurse into zapping him on that
bed.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: I think it was a girl from hematology he’s
been running with.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: My God, it’s a Roman farce.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: I thought I heard you out here,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: I’ll need one from both of you, three
copies, and I suggest you do that right now. The forms are in my
office…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: I’m really so terribly sorry about this,
Dr. Bock. I…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: As I understand it, one of the nurses
inadvertently administered an I.V. to Schaefer here. How the hell could
that happen?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Listen, I think we ought to straighten
this out somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Yes, very good idea. Oh God, what a
mess.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Well, these things happen, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: I suppose I’d better call the Medical
Examiner.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I still don’t know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Well, it took an hour to get it
sorted out. It seems a patient named Guernsey died last night in
Eight-O-Six, but that information wasn’t given to the night nurses.
These things happen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: At any rate, according to the cardex,
the patient Guernsey was down for twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-
6-H, so Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez to give him his twelve o’clock
shot. Meanwhile, it seems Dr. Schaefer had usurped that particular bed
for his own purposes. Dr. Brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst, and
some weight is given that hypothesis by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was
naked.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I get the drift, Mrs. Christie. In other
words, Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was the
patient Guernsey. My God! What I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: If I may finish, Doctor. Well, after
Perez gave him his shot, she noticed the I.V. on the bed had been
pinched off, and she reported that back to Mrs. Reardon, who then
assigned Nurse Rivers to restart the I.V. Now Rivers was a float. She
didn’t even know the staff people on the floor, and nobody knew what the
patient Guernsey looked like anyway, since he’d only been admitted that
morning.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: So she plugged an I.V. into him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: A liter.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: intrudes into his</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: I’ve got nearly a thousand nurses in
this hospital.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And every time one of them has her period, she
disappears for three days. My doctors complain regularly they can’t find
the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row. What the hell am I
supposed to tell that boy Schaefer’s parents? That a substitute nurse
assassinated him, because she couldn’t tell the doctors from the
patients on the floor? My God, the incompetence here is absolutely
radiant! I mean, two separate nurses walk into a room, stick needles
into a man – and one of those was a number eighteen jelco! – tourniquet
the poor sonofabitch, anchor the poor sonofabitch’s arm with adhesive
tape, and it’s the wrong poor sonofabitch! I mean, my God! Where do you
train your nurses, Mrs. Christie? Dachau!? All right, wrap him up and
get him down to Pathology. I’m especially interested in his blood sugar.
A liter of glucose never killed anybody. Your ladies must’ve done
something else to him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Will there be anything else,
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Before you call the family, Doctor, I
wish you’d talk to Mr. Mead about this. We’d like, naturally, to avoid
litigation.</p>
<p><strong>miss lebow</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>miss lebow</strong>: A few things have been piling up. Would
you like to go into them?</p>
<p><strong>miss lebow</strong>: A quickie. Dr. Esterhazy wants to start
hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations. He says last year
some of the replacement people didn’t receive their checks until they
waited six months. He wonders if you could do something about getting
these people paid more promptly.</p>
<p><strong>miss lebow</strong>: Miss Aronovici complains the lab reports
are coming in slow into the E.R. I called Dr. Immelman about that, and
she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last
two months. Charley Waters also complains about pilferage. I’ve clumped
all those together for you… Now, as you know, Doctor, we’ve agreed to
take over the local ambulance cases as part of the hospital’s commitment
to the community, and it’s created a serious overload in the E.R. I
don’t know why this was dumped in our lap, but…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his office
yet.</p>
<p><strong>miss lebow</strong>: Which Dr. Einhorn? Ophthalmology or
Psychiatry?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Psychiatry. Never mind. I’ll look in
myself.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Is he in?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Can you give me a few minutes, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: bespectacled, late</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’ve been having periods of acute depression
recently. Apparently, it’s becoming noticeable. A number of people have
remarked on it. Anyway, John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea
if I spoke to you about it.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: Do you want to sit down, Herb?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: No. I’m not good at confessional. Well, what
can I tell you? The last year, two, three… it goes way back, I suppose.
I can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student. At
any rate, I’ve always found life demanding. I’m an only child of
lower-middle-class people. I was the glory of my parents. My son the
doctor. Well, you know. I was always top of my class. Scholarship to
Harvard. The boy genius, the brilliant eccentric. Terrified of women,
clumsy at sports. God, Joe, how the hell do I go about this?</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: I understand you just separated from your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I left her a dozen times. She left me a dozen
times. We stayed together through a process of attrition. Obviously
sado-masochistic dependency. My home is hell. We’ve got a twenty-
three-year-old boy I threw out of the house last year. A shaggy-haired
Maoist. I don’t know where he is, presumably building bombs in basements
as an expression of his universal brotherhood. I’ve got a seventeen-
year-old daughter who’s had two abortions in two years and got arrested
last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs. They let her off. The
typical affluent American family. I don’t mean to be facile about
this.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I blame myself for those two useless young
people. I never exercised parental authority. I’m no good at that. Oh,
God, I’m no good at this either. Joe, let’s just forget the whole thing.
I’m sorry I bothered you.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: How serious are your suicidal speculations,
Herb?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I amuse myself with different ways of killing
myself that don’t look like suicide. I wouldn’t want to do my family out
of the insurance.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: A good toxologist would find traces.
Potassium’s much better. Sixty milli equivalent. Instantaneous. Of
course, then you’re stuck with how to get rid of the hypodermic. Forty
milli equivalent. Gives you plenty of time to dispose of the
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: You seem to have given considerable thought
to the matter.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You ought to know a man who talks about it all
the time never does it.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: I don’t know. I see a man who’s exhausted,
emotionally drained, riddled with guilt, and has been systematically
stripping himself of his wife, children, friends, isolating himself from
the world. Are you impotent?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Intermittently.</p>
<p><strong>einhorn</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: It means I haven’t tried in so long, I don’t
know. Let’s just drop the whole thing, Joe. I feel humiliated and
stupid. All I have to do is pull myself together and get back into my
work. I’m sorry I troubled you. Take care of yourself. I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: All set?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Who’s that exotic group?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: You got me. They’ve been here about an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>one young doctor</strong>: I think they’re with the old man
in Eight-O-Six.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis and
the liver nodes for today, right?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Good. Because that’s the one I studied up. A
hell of a case.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: All right, who’s presenting?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Is there anybody seated who hasn’t
been to see me first? Is there anyone here who hasn’t given me their
health insurance number?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Emergency Room… Well, I don’t know,
Sybil. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Would you wait a moment, please. I’m
on the phone, can’t you see I’m on the phone? …Of course not, do they
ever? Would you mind, please. I have to get through, do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Give me that one again… thirty- two?</p>
<p><strong>paranoid lady</strong>: They follow me everywhere. Three big
black men. Naked, completely exposed. Right in the street. Hanging down
to their knees. Disgusting. They’re waiting out there for me now…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Did you call upstairs and tell them to
admit a patient named Mitgang?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aronovici</strong>: The concussion?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: I don’t know. They just called me.
They said you didn’t fill out the chart. And where do you come off
sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. aronovici</strong>: Sally, would you get the fuck out of
here. The patient’s in the Holding Room. You want his Blue Cross number,
you go in and you get his Blue Cross number.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Do you mind, please…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: O.P.D. wants to know how that asthmatic they
sent down is.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: group around the</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: May I see you a moment, Doctor, if you
don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: If you don’t mind, Doctor, is this
your handwriting?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Am I supposed to read that? Was it a
sprain? Was it a broken wrist? I can’t read that scribbling. I mean, I
have to bill these people. I know you doctors are the ministering
angels, and I’m just the bitch from the Accounting Department, but I
have my job to do too. I mean, if you don’t mind, Doctor…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: The kid had a collar fracture. We had
him in the O.R. We reduced it and we gave him a small cast.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: But did you give him a sling? You must
have taken X-rays. How am I supposed to make up the charges?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Are you Mitgang?</p>
<p><strong>mitgang</strong>: I’m Mitgang.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield,
Mr. Mitgang, if you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Do you have your card with you? Do you
know your number?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Mr. Mitgang, you’re not leaving this
room until I have this information.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Will you leave that man alone?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Do you mind if I at least ask this
gentleman to fill out his chart?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: May I have your A.H.S. policy number,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Do you carry Blue Cross? Blue
Shield?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: I think one of your patients in here
is dead, Dr. Spezio.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Because he wouldn’t give me his Blue
Cross number, Dr. Spezio.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: How the hell long has this man been
lying here? Isn’t this that doctor who came in around nine o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: I mean, they gave me a hard time,
Con Ed. “For Pete’s Sake,” I said, “this is a hospital. One of our
feedlines just blew…”</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: I mean, it’s lucky we traced it in
time.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: No, I’ll be right up. Have we covered
about everything?</p>
<p><strong>administrative resident</strong>: Dr. Kish has been driving
me nuts with the O.R. schedule.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: He’s supposed to see me about that.</p>
<p><strong>mead’s secretary</strong>: from talking on the</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: One of our staff?</p>
<p><strong>mead’s secretary</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Tom, you want to go down to the
Emergency Room? One of our doctors just died.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: What? Another one?</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Yeah, see what that’s about. I’ll be on
Holly Eight. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>dr. immelmen</strong>: It’s no longer pilferage, Milton. It’s
reached the point of piracy. That’s the third microscope this month.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Why don’t we get together on this
sometime this afternoon, Fran?</p>
<p><strong>dr. immelman</strong>: One o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: One o’clock will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Your brother’s in the room,
Mr. Mead.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: What room is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Eight-O-Six.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Willie, you’re going
to be in the hospital for two lousy days. What’re you making such a fuss
about?</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: You’re supposed to be such a big wheel
here.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: There are no private rooms available.
If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh off the cross, I couldn’t get Him
a private room.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I’m not going to stay in a room with a
dying man…</p>
<p><strong>marilyn mead</strong>: He’s not dying. They’ll screen him
off. You won’t even know he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: If you want a private room, go on home,
and I’ll call you the first one that comes up. But you’re the one who
phoned me in a panic, you’re going on a vacation. For heaven’s sake,
Willie, they’ll cut this polyp out tomorrow morning. You’ll be home
Thursday, you’ll be in Miami Friday. Marilyn, will you talk some sense
into this lunatic?</p>
<p><strong>marilyn mead</strong>: Well, you said it, he’s a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: Big wheel, can’t even get me a private
room.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: I’ll get you a tranquilizer…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: …five, a full abdomen contrasted to wasting
elsewhere; six, ascites with a protein content above four grams;
unexplained anemia, leukopenia, unexplained elevation of the serum gamma
globulin level, especially abnormal flocculation tests, and of course, a
positive P.P.D. All these findings assume special significance among
Negroes. This has been a very commendable workup, as commendable a
workup of an F.U.O. as I can remember. The staff of this floor is to be
applauded. It’s a reportable case, Brubaker. Write it up. Well, let’s go
have a look at the girl.</p>
<p><strong>sutcliffe</strong>: Nurse! Nurse, who’s the Senior Resident
on this floor?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That would be Dr. Brubaker. But I’m afraid
he’s at Chief of Service rounds right now.</p>
<p><strong>sutcliffe</strong>: That’s… this way?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I wonder if there might not be some
correlation between hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction. Presumably,
there was an early consideration of S.B.E.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir. We discounted it after repeated
blood cultures were negative.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You, Ambler. Is that right, Ambler?</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What else do you look for in bacterial
endocarditis?</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: Some sort of embolic phenomena, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sutcliffe</strong>: Dr. Brubaker, I wonder if I could see you
for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Still a little icteric. Who’s got an
opthalmoscope?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Did anyone note Roth spots?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Well, don’t worry about it. There aren’t any.
Ambler, you’re our big man on S.B.E. What was the latex- fixation?</p>
<p><strong>biegelman</strong>: It wasn’t done, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Don’t you think that’s an important test to
differentiate S.B.E. from miliary T.B.?</p>
<p><strong>biegelman</strong>: No, s…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: Well, there’s about a seventy percent
incidence of false-positive latex in</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You have been reading up. If the diagnosis
were S.B.E., would a positive latex indicate anything in the
therapy?</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: We’d expect the latex to become
negative.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: If…?</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: If the antibiotic therapy were
successful.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Are you applying for your internship here?</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Come and see me. Would you sit up for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: We’ve got a little thing over here,
Doctor. The girl over there is the daughter of the patient in Eight-O-
Six. He is at the moment comatose and requires intravenous feeding and
meds.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: The thing is, the daughter wants to take
the father out of the hospital and back to Mexico where they live. The
patient’s name is Drummond. He’s apparently a Methodist missionary, and
he and his daughter run some kind of religious mission among the Apache
Indians. The daughter claims to be a licensed nurse, so she can give the
necessary I.V. treatment. I certainly don’t think he should be let out
of this hospital. The Attending – he’s the guy in gray over there –
concurs.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: All right, wait a minute. Let me have all that
again.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: As a matter of fact, Doctor, this is
Dr. Biegelman’s case.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Never mind the professional ethics, what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: I don’t know why I’m covering for that
sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion anyway. The patient, a man of fifty-six,
was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check-up, in good
health, no visible distress. We did the mandatory work-up on him. Blood
cultures, stool, L.E. preps, chest, E.K.G., all negative. But there was
apparently some evidence of protein in his urine. I don’t know how that
sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever found out about it. Maybe he had
some kind of deal with one of the girls in the lab. Anyway, he turned up
the next day, conned the patient into signing an authorization for a
biopsy…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Some post-grad fellow named Ives. Elroy
Ives. I never met him. He’s on one of the immunology research
programs.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Are you trying to tell me some post- grad
fellow came up here and did a biopsy on the patient?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman with that
old story about…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: …protein in the urine?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And he biopsied the man?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: And he nicked a vessel, and at two o’clock
in the morning, they woke up Biegelman because the nurse found the
patient in shock. Biegelman called the kidney people for a consult right
away. What was there to see? The man was sour and bleeding. We spoke to
this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred us to a surgeon named
Welbeck…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Welbeck?! That barber!</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: You ain’t heard nothing yet. So we finally
got Welbeck around four in the morning. He said, go ahead. So they laid
on the surgery for eight. Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders an
I.V.P., clears him for allergies…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: …without actually testing.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And the patient went into shock…</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: …and tubular necrosis. They lopped out the
bleeding kidney, ran him back to the room, and we sat around waiting for
three days to see how obstructed he was. Fever began spiking like hell,
euremia, vomiting, so we arranged hemodialysis. He’s putting out good
water now. But some nurse goofed on his last treatment. A leak in the
tube, something. His blood pressure plunged. They ran him right up to
I.C.U., checked out vital signs, all normal except he’s comatose. That
was two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: In short, a man came into this hospital in
perfectly good health, and, in the space of one week, we chopped out one
kidney, damaged the other, reduced him to coma and damn near killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You know, Brubaker, last night I sat in my
hotel room, reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide.
Then I said “No, Bock, don’t do it. You’re a doctor, a healer. You’re
the Chief of Medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world. You’re
a necessary person. Your life is meaningful.” Then I came in this
morning and find out one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses
who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a technician from the
nephrology lab…</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Hematology, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And now you come to me with this gothic horror
story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently
conspired to destroy one lousy patient. How am I to sustain my feeling
of meaningfulness in the face of this? You know, Brubaker, if there was
an oven around, I’d stick my head in it. What was the name of that
sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion again?</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: Ives, sir. Elroy Ives. Somebody ought to
ream his ass.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m going to ream his ass. And I’m going to
break that barber Welbeck’s back. I’m going to defrock those two
cannibals. They won’t practice in my hospital, I’ll tell you that!</p>
<p><strong>brubaker</strong>: What’ll I tell the girl, sir? She says we
have no legal right to stop her from taking her father out. She’s
willing to sign an A.O.R. form.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Let him go. Before we kill him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: Hi, Herb…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Get me Dr. Gilley. Put him on page if you have
to. I want to talk to him right now. I don’t care if he’s operating. And
you get me some monkey named Ives. Ives. I-V-E-S, first name Elroy. He’s
in the Farkis Pavilion.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: Herb…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I want to talk to you, Joe. Would you mind
coming into my office?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Have you got some punk named Ives rotating in
your department?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: Listen, Herb…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I also want to know what the hell kind of a
dialysis room you’re running. I just came from…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yeah… Gilley? Put him on. Bock. Didn’t you
tell me a couple of months ago you were going to cut off all privileges
for that assassin, Welbeck? Yeah. Wellbeck. He just butchered another
one of my patients… Oh, come on, Harry! The man’s a buccaneer! I want
him brought before the Medical Executive Committee… He’s in your
department, Harry, not mine. He’s putatively a surgeon!… I’ll be here!
Listen, Joe, I think you should know that you’ve got a research guy in
your department named Ives who’s been doing some very dubious biopsies.
We’re having enough trouble squeezing grants out of the Nixon
administration…</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: Ives is dead, Herb. That’s why I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What do you mean, Ives is dead?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: I mean he’s dead. He had a heart
attack in the Emergency Room.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: He had a heart attack in the Emergency
Room?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What the hell is this? Some kind of plague?
Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: They were just taking him down to
Pathology.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: …and the next thing anybody knew, about
three hours later, Mrs. Cushing from Accounting came in and said there
was a dead man in the Holding Room.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You don’t find anything grotesque about all
this?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I mean, at half past eight this morning, we
meet over a doctor who’s been killed intravenously, and here we are
again, four hours later, with another doctor who had a heart attack in
the Emergency Room.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Well, what’re you suggesting Doctor? Do
you think we have a mad killer stalking the halls of the hospital?
Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart attack and Schaefer in a diabetic
coma. People do die of these things. It’s all perhaps coincidental, but
I don’t think I’d call it grotesque.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: How long are they going to be on Schaefer’s
post?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I don’t suppose you’d like to call next of
kin?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lagerman</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Oh God, I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: Mead.</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: Mr. Mead… Mr. Mead, I have an
injection for you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: What the hell is going on in
there?</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor in
Eight-O-Six, and you better go in there. You know that Indian that was
sitting in Eight-O-Six all night? He’s still there, and the girl’s
there, and they’re doing some voodoo in there, and I ain’t kidding.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: I mean that Indian’s in there, half-
naked and going pis-pis-pis with a little bag. You just better get in
there, Mrs. Dunne.</p>
<p><strong>nurse devine</strong>: coming out of another</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Look, it’s a perfectly harmless ceremony,
nothing to get excited about. It’ll be over in a few minutes anyway.
Mr. Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder, and it’s
imperative he conclude his rituals while the storm is still going
on.</p>
<p><strong>nurse dunne</strong>: Visiting hours were over at nine
o’clock, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: All that’s going on in there, Doctor, is a
simple Apache prayer for my father’s recovery.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The markings he’s made on my father’s arms
are from the pollen of the tule plant. The twigs have no significance
other than they’ve been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals
to the spirit of lightning. It’s all entirely harmless, a religious
ceremony, not a medical one.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You don’t seriously believe all that
mumbo-jumbo will cure him?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: On the other hand, it won’t kill him,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Miss Drummond, are you still taking your
father out?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes. I still have to arrange an ambulance
service. Is there a phone around I could use?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Use my office.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hello. I’d like to arrange an ambulance for
one-thirty tomorrow afternoon… Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: …Drummond, first name, Barbara. I’ll pay
cash…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, you’re to pick up my father, Drummond,
Edward, at the Manhattan Medical Center, Holly Pavilion, Room
Eight-O-Six. It’s a stretcher case. I presume you provide the
stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He’s to be taken to American Airlines, Yes…
No… Kennedy Airport, Flight Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma, Arizona. I’ll
accompany the patient… Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You believe in witchcraft, Miss Drummond?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I believe in everything, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: My father, you should know, was a very
successful doctor in Boston, a member of the Harvard Medical Faculty. He
was a widower, and I was his only child. He was not an especially
religious man, a sober Methodist. One evening, seven years ago, he
attended a Pentecostal meeting in the commons rooms at Harvard and
suddenly found himself speaking in tongues. That is to say, he suddenly
sank to his knees at the back of the room and began to talk fluently in
a language which no one had ever heard before. This sort of thing
happens frequently at Pentecostal meetings, and they began to happen
regularly to my father. It was not unusual to walk into our home and
find my father sitting in his office, utterly serene and happily
speaking to the air in this strange foreign tongue. I was, at that time
twenty years old and having my obligatory affair with a minority group,
in my case a Hopi Indian, a post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing his
doctorate in the aboriginal languages of the Southwest. One day, I
brought the Indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his knees
in the entrance foyer in one of his trances. The Indian wheeled in his
tracks and said, “Well, I’ll be a sonofabitch.” You see, my father was
speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure dialect at that, spoken only by a
ragged band of unreconstructed Indians who had rejected the reservation
and were living in total isolation in the Sierra Madre Mountains of
northern Mexico. Well! What do you say to that, Dr. Bock?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: at her as if she</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m sitting here boozing and, all of a sudden,
you start telling me some demented story about your father’s religious
conversion.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, no, you miss the point, Doctor. Not my
father’s conversion – mine. You see, I had been hitting the acid pretty
regularly at that time. I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities,
some suicidal despairs, but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure
Apache dialect. I mean, like wow, man! I mean, here was living afflatus
right before my eyes! Within a week, my father had closed his Beacon
Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican mountains.
And I turned in my S.D.S. card and my crash helmet and followed him. It
was a disaster, at least for me. My father had received the revelation,
not I. He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to
solemnly amused Indians. I masturbated a great deal. We lived in a grass
wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed pi�on nuts. It was hideous.
Within two months, I was back in Boston, a hollow shell and dizzy with
dengue, disenchanted with everything. I turned to austerity, combed my
hair tight and entered nursing school. I became haggard, driven and had
shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father. I took up with some of
the senior staff at the hospital. One of them, a portly psychiatrist,
explained I was generated by an unresolved lust for my father. I
apparently cracked up. One day, they found me walking to work naked and
screaming obscenities. There was talk of institutionalizing me, so I
packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains.
I’ve been there ever since. That’s three years. My father is, of course,
mad as a hatter. I watch over him and have been curiously content. You
see, Doctor, I believe in everything.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Now what was that all about, Miss
Drummond?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I thought I was obvious as hell. I’m trying
to tell you I have a thing for middle-aged men.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I admire your candor.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’ve been admiring a lot more than
that.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You’re wasting your time. I’ve been impotent
for years.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What the hell’s wrong with being impotent? My
God, you kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians! I’ve got a
son, twenty-three. I threw him out of the house last year. Pietistic
little humbug. He preached universal love and despised everyone. He had
a blanket contempt for the middle class, even its decencies. He detested
my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor. I
cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady. When
she died, he didn’t even come to the funeral. He thought the chapel
service an hypocrisy. His generation didn’t live with lies, he told me.
“Everybody lives with lies,” I said. I grabbed him by his poncho,
dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent
middle-class apartment and flung him out. I haven’t seen him since. But
do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the
verge of tears. He shrieked at me: “You old fink! You can’t even get it
up anymore!” That was it, you see. That was his real revolution. It
wasn’t racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam. The
ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus. Hah! My God, if
there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country, it’s us
poor impotent bastards. Well, I’m impotent and proud of it! Impotence is
beautiful, baby! Power to the Impotent! Right on, baby!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Right on.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: When I say impotent, I don’t mean merely limp.
Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may sometimes lust for
other things, something less transient than an erection, some sense of
permanent worth. That’s what medicine was for me, my reason for being.
When I was thirty-four, Miss Drummond, I presented a paper before the
annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that
pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology. A breakthrough! I’m in
all the textbooks. I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And you
want to know something, Miss Drummond? I don’t give a goddam. When I say
I’m impotent, I mean I’ve lost even my desire for work, which is a hell
of a lot more primal a passion than sex. I’ve lost my raison d’etre, my
purpose, the only thing I ever truly loved. It’s all rubbish anyway.
Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth
ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half
the kids in this ghetto haven’t even been inoculated for polio! We have
assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived, and
people are sicker than ever! We cure nothing! We heal nothing! The whole
goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes! That’s what
I mean when I say impotent! You don’t know what the hell I’m talking
about, do you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Of course, I do.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m tired, I’m terribly tired, Miss Drummond.
And I hurt, and I’ve got nothing going for me anymore. Can you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Then can you understand that the only
admissable matter left is death?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid
menopause.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Oh Christ.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, it’s hard for me to take your despair
very seriously, Doctor. You obviously enjoy it so much.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Oh, bugger off. That’s all I need now,
clinical insights. Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: …acidhead’s going to reassure me about
menopause now. Look, I’d like to be alone, so why don’t you beat it?
Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt,
but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with. Back at the
tribe, I wear ankle-length buckskin.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Swell. Just close the door and turn off the
lights.</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: What’re you shooting, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Leave me alone…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Potassium. You take enough of this stuff,
it’ll kill you, Doc. It occurred to me that I might have read you wrong,
that you really were suicidal. So I came back.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Who the hell asked you!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Who the hell asked you!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Leave me alone! Why the hell don’t you leave
me alone!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Why didn’t you let me do it? Who the hell
asked you!</p>
<p><strong>campanella</strong>: Well, I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>campanella</strong>: Do you have a match, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You wouldn’t be awake.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I swiped this for you out of the nurses’
locker room. I’ll make good on your dress. I’m afraid it’s torn beyond
repair. Buy yourself a new one or, if you like, give me your size and
I’ll send it on to you. But I want to talk to you about that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Talk to me about what?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: About your father. You really shouldn’t move
him in his condition. I just had a look at his chart. There’s no reason
to presume brain damage. You know as well as I you can’t predict
anything in these instances. He could pull out of that coma at any time.
I think you should let him stay here. I’ll personally look after
him.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Is this your way of saying you’d like me to
stay in town a few more days?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Well, that would be nice, too.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What do you say, Miss Drummond?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I expect you can call me Barbara,
considering you ravished me three times last night.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Three times?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, look at him, pretending he didn’t
count. You were as puffed up as a toad about it. Punched a couple of
holes in your crusade for universal impotence, didn’t it? I think we’re
on a first name basis by now. I’ll call you Herb.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Let’s give your father a week, Barbara, what
do you say?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, I don’t want my father in this
hospital. I had a dream about this hospital. I dreamt this enormous
starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano, and all
the patients, doctors, nurses, attendants, orderlies, the whole line
staff, the food service people, the aged, the lame – and you right in
the middle – were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into
the sea. I’m taking my father out of here – and as quickly as I can.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You’re a real fruitcake, you know?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, let me put it this way. I love you. I
fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway
upstairs. I said to Mr. Blacktree, “Who’s that hulking bear of a man?”
The Apaches are reverential about bears. They won’t eat bear meat; they
never skin bears. Bear is thought of as both benign and evil, but very
strong power. Men with bear power are highly respected and are
frequently said to be great healers.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I said to Mr. Blacktree, “That man gets his
power from the bear.”</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Swell. Now, look, do you have a hotel, some
sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: All right, let me put it this way, Herb. My
father and I accept the implacability of death. If he dies, he dies, but
I’m taking him out of here and back to Mexico about one o’clock this
afternoon. I want you to come with us, because I love you and want
children.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m afraid Mexico sounds a little too remote
for me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We could use you down there, you know.
There’s a curiously high incidence of T.B. And you’d be a doctor again,
Herb. You’d be necessary again. If you love me, I don’t see what other
choice you have.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What do you mean, if I love you? I raped you
in a suicidal rage. How did we get to love and children all of a
sudden?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, for heaven’s sake, Herb, I ought to
know if a man loves me or not. You must have told me half a hundred
times last night you loved me. You murmured it, shouted it; one time,
you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I think those were more expressions of
gratitude than love.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Gratitude for what?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Well, my God, for resurrecting feelings of
life in me I thought dead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, my God, what do you think love
is?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Okay, I love you, and you love me. I’m not
about to argue with so relentless a romantic. Well, then, since we have
this great passion going for us, I don’t see why you won’t stay on here
in New York for a week or ten days…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s up to ten days now.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: As long as it takes for your father’s
condition to improve.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. I’ve had these prophetic dreams for
seven nights. Seven is a sinister number. The meaning of these dreams is
very clear, seven times as clear. I am to get my father and you out of
this hospital before we are all destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You’re certifiable! My God, half the time
you’re a perfectly intelligent young woman, and then suddenly you turn
into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams, witchcraft and bear
power! And I don’t like the way you dismiss my whole life as
unnecessary. I do a lot of healing right here in Manhattan. I don’t have
to go to Mexico for it. I also teach. I send out eighty doctors a year
into the world, sometimes inspirited, at least competent. I’ve built up
one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world. We’ve got a
hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group. A lot of people
come into this hospital in big trouble, Miss Drummond, and go out better
for the experience. So don’t tell me how unnecessary I am.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: into the nurse’s</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: So how come, eight hours ago, you were
trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Where are you going now?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: My hotel. I have to check out.
Mr. Blacktree doesn’t speak any English.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Well, you’re coming back, of course.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Of course. I have to settle the bill here
and pack my father. And I think you need a few hours alone to make your
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What decisions?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’re a very tired and very damaged man.
You’ve had a hideous marriage and I assume a few tacky affairs along the
way. You’re understandably reluctant to get involved again. And, on top
of that, here I am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up
and go off with me to some barren mountains of Mexico. It sounds utterly
mad, I know. On the other hand, you obviously find this world as
desolate as I do. You did try to kill yourself last night. So that’s it,
Herb. Either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium. I’ll be
back in an hour or so. I’ll be in my father’s room.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: All right. I love you! My God!</p>
<p><strong>a drug rehabilitation community center, to be completed
in</strong>: 1973. E.F. SCHLAGER &amp; CO., CONTRACTORS. Suddenly, the
sign comes crashing down into CAMERA. It has been wrenched off the
wooden fence protecting the row of tenements and brownstones being
demolished. About a dozen young and loud militants have torn it
down.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: I repeat. I’m asking you to come out
peacefully. These buildings are condemned and unfit for habitation.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: You people are possessing this
building illegally and in violation of the law. I’m asking you to come
out peacefully…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bassey</strong>: …complete sympathy with the tenants. So
the hospital has assumed the responsibility of finding 400 housing units
in good buildings. The hospital wishes to point out that this particular
row of buildings on First Avenue was condemned by the City before the
hospital acquired ownership, and even then, only after responsible
leaders in the community had approved the building of our new drug
rehabilitation center.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Goddammit, Barry, I’ve got a dozen
community leaders waiting for me in the library! We’ve been trying to
work out some kind of negotiable formula for two years! And with no help
from you people in the Urban Affairs Division, I might add!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: And I’m not going to throw all that down
the drain because some cockamamie activist group is show-boating for the
television cameras! You get those people out of those buildings before a
wall collapses or a fire breaks out and we’ve got a riot on our hands!…
Okay!</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Having your troubles, eh? Well, I won’t
take much of your time. My name’s Welbeck. I’ve been associated with
this hospital for six years, and, yesterday afternoon, Dr. Gilley called
me to say he was cutting off my privileges at the hospital. Do you know
anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: It’s news to me.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: He said he sent the report on.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: I’ll probably get it tomorrow. Report on
what?</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Well, I’m not sure myself. I did a
nephrectomy on a man about seven days ago. Emergency, called in at four
in the morning. The man was hemorrhaging, he’d gone sour…</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Welbeck, I’m terribly sorry, but I do
have this meeting. In any event, there’s nothing I can do about it. If
Gilley wants to cut your privileges, he’s Chief of Surgery, it’s within
his province. You’ll have to have the hearing…</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I have a laparotomy laid on for this
morning. I assume I’ll be allowed to go through with that.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I’ve been associated with this hospital for
six years…</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Now, now, Welbeck. It seems to me I’ve
had your name down here before for something… I’ll be in the staff
room.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re the fellow with the
Medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public, right? I
mean, something like that? Milton Mead was telling me about you just the
other day. You’re a whole medical conglomerate. You’ve got a Factoring
service, a computerized billing company, and a few proprietary
hospitals, a few nursing homes. Good heavens, Welbeck, you shouldn’t be
brought up before a committee of mere doctors. You should be
investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. You’ll have to
go through with the hearing, Welbeck. I don’t interfere in these
things.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: …no goddam halfway house, no way, baby! We
ain’t gonna wait ’til 1973 to deal with this problem! We want to kill
the drug thing right now!… imperializing the Blackaporican community,
and we reject the bourgie- ass middle-class black traitors and flunkies
who are selling out the Blackaporican proletariat masses to the
expansionist, racist policies of this shit hospital!…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Let’s get back to the abortion issue!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sit down, Woman!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What the hell does the male establishment
know about abortions?</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: Who the hell raised the issue of birth
control? The issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this
community and in the ghetto generally.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: We don’t want no goddam abortion…</p>
<p><strong>white doctor</strong>: Let’s… let’s get down to the core of
this matter.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The point is that this hospital is the landlord
for those buildings and they should’ve turned them down.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Those buildings are imperialistic extensions of
the medical establishment. This hospital ought to be rebuilding those
tenements, give those people decent housing.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Please, please, please!</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: You know, I hallucinated last night. I
hallucinated there was an Indian doing a war dance in here.</p>
<p><strong>nurse chile</strong>: You weren’t hallucinating, Mr. Mead.
There was an Indian in here last night.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: There was?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dr. Norris says about half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>second nurse</strong>: Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian
cyst.</p>
<p><strong>third nurse</strong>: Shirley, it was just an ovarian
cyst!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: All right, Jerry, go up to Holly
Six.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: William Mead from Holly Eight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: Hold him there, Tom. We’ve got
somebody coming out right now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: Who’s that? Mangafranni?</p>
<p><strong>circulating nurse</strong>: Yeah. Number three, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: It’s legal for a doctor to incorporate in
New York, isn’t it, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Since last September. If they had that when
I was your age, I’d have put away a couple of million by now. It gives
you a variety of deferral devices, profit-sharing for example. Let’s say
you pick yourself an October 31-fiscal. You declare a bonus payable in
’71. An accrued item payable to a principle share-holder must be paid
within two and half months after the close of the year to get the
deduction in the prior year. But your corporation doesn’t pay that tax,
because we’ve eliminated the taxable income with the bonus. With two
taxable entities, you can bury a hell of a lot of expenses… Hello, this
is Welbeck, any messages?… Well, I’m at the hospital. I have to cut open
some guy in a couple of minutes. I’ll try to make it as fast as I can.
How urgent did he say it was?… Well, Dr. Hogan made those arrangements
with the underwriters. The Registration Statement was filed with the
S.E.C. well over a year ago… If he calls again, have me paged here. The
really big money is in health leasing, of course. Dr. Hogan, the eminent
orthopedic surgeon, and I incorporated a leasing company and went public
last year. I hold a controlling interest in a number of proprietary
hospitals, nursing homes and rest farms, and I’ve been leasing hospital
equipment to my own hospitals at excessive rates. Why, you ask, am I
draining my own hospitals? Well, my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent,
and I’m giving my leasing company a hell of a price-earnings ratio,
which’ll balloon the market value of the stock. I hold three hundred
thousand shares of that stock, lettered of course, but in a year, I’ll
dump those shares at a capital gain and walk off with a bundle…</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Mangafranni, right?</p>
<p><strong>scrub nurse</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: What do you say, huh? We’re not going
to hang it in the Louvre, you know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: Bring a mask over.</p>
<p><strong>resident anesthesiologist</strong>: There’s no pulse,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: What’s the pressure?</p>
<p><strong>resident anesthesiologist</strong>: There’s no blood
pressure, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: No pulse. Get the tube and E.K.G.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: I can’t feel a thing, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: I don’t know. She must have thrown an
embolus. She was doing fine up to now. Did you check the gasses?</p>
<p><strong>resident anesthesiologist</strong>: I did, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: The only time I ever saw anybody conk out
like this, some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Get the damn leads on. For Chrissakes,
what the hell is this?!</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: She’s just a young woman, sir. Do you
think we should open the chest?</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: She’s fifty-three, you buttonhead!</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Bicarb?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: She’s fibrillating, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Jesus H. Christ!</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: Okay, stop for a minute… Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: You got those paddles ready?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: I may be crazy, Doctor, but I don’t think
this is your patient.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: What the hell are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Now, I don’t want to get into an institutional
hassle with you, Mrs. Christie. The malpractice here is monumental. As
you see, Dr. Schaefer’s blood sugar was twenty-three. No glucose
solution is going to do that. The only thing that will do that is at
least fifty units of insulin, probably more. The only presumption is
that one of those nurses on the Eighth Floor shot fifty units of insulin
into Schaefer’s blood stream, either by injection or through the I.V.,
although how in God’s name…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: I’m very sorry, Doctor. May I?</p>
<p><strong>miss mcguire</strong>: Doctor, did you ask the head nurse on
the eighth floor to let you know when a Miss Drummond got there?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miss mcguire</strong>: Well, she just got there.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Oh, dear me, Dorothy. I better get
right down there directly. Have you called the O.O.D.? And you better
call Dr. Gilley. And you better call Mr. Sloan… Yes, I’ll be down
directly. I’m very sorry, Doctor, but there’s a real nasty one in the
O.R. They’ve just operated on the wrong patient…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: …well, I don’t understand, is she back
in her room? When did she get back to her room? Who brought her back?…
She’s back in her room.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: Mrs. Mangafranni, the woman who was
supposed to have been operated on… Are they still working on that woman
in Three?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Fried, would you say
that again?… Well, nobody in this office sent her back up… Well, all
right, Mrs. Fried, I’ll have to call you back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: Did any of you take a woman named
Mangafranni out of the Holding Room back up to Holly Five around ten
o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: I don’t know what happened. A patient
named Mangafranni was scheduled for a hysterectomy at ten o’clock –
Dr. Mallory. I talked to Sylvia in the Holding Room who admitted her, so
she was here. And now I just spoke to Mrs. Fried on Holly Five, and she
says an orderly brought Mrs. Mangafranni back to her room about twenty
minutes ago. Now Mrs. Mangafranni is in her room sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Well, who’s the woman in the
operating room?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kimball</strong>: Well, they had to open her up, and
that’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: I better get Mr. Mead.</p>
<p><strong>lady from women’s lib</strong>: …abortion? The clinic should
be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered
by a member of the Women’s Committee for Medical Liberation!</p>
<p><strong>young white activist</strong>: …let’s get to the core of the
matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the American
medical establishment and the drug, insurance and tobacco companies who,
through their combined racketeering efforts, have produced a dual system
of health care. Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor!</p>
<p><strong>black panther</strong>: …abortion clinic! That’s genocide,
baby! You’re just killing off blacks! We consider proliferation
elemental to the class struggle!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: cool altogether and is screaming right
along with everyone</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: How long ago did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: About half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Have you called the Medical
Examiner?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Well, you’d better do that now. And you
better call the precinct station house as well.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Good morning, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: This is really something, isn’t it? I
thought she looked a little different when they brought her in. I even
said to one of the nurses, “She looks a little younger without her
dentures.” I’d only talked to her half an hour before.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Does anybody know who she is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: examining the chart dangling from
the</p>
<p><strong>circulating resident</strong>: Her chart says Mangafranni.
Her bracelet says Mangafranni. The only thing that isn’t Mangafranni is
the woman.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Jesus H. Christ! I’ve been chopping out
three uteruses a day for twenty years, and is it too much to expect for
you people to bring in the right goddam Jesus Christ uterus?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. chu</strong>: I had just been talking to her in the
Holding Room. She was perfectly fine. A little drowsy. I thought it was
funny that when they brought her in, she was out cold.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Jesus H. Kee-rist!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. christie</strong>: Well, we’ll just all have to stay
here until Mr. Mead or someone from the O.O.D. comes back.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mallory</strong>: Well, I’m not taking the rap for this!
I’ve already got one malpractice suit pending, and I’m not taking the
rap for this one!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Look, you’re not going. I love you, and I’m
not going to let you go.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Come on, let’s start putting your father’s
things back. He’s staying here. I’ll find an apartment somewhere. I’m
staying in a filthy little hotel room. We can’t use that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I can’t make it here, Herb. I’ll crack up.
I cracked up once already. One week here, and I’d be running naked
through the streets screaming again. I can retain my sanity only in a
simple society.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: For God’s sake, Barbara, you can’t seriously
see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner? Be
sensible for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I am being sensible. What is it you’re so
afraid of leaving here? Your plastic home? Your conditioned air? Your
synthetic clothes? Your instant food? I’m offering you green silence and
solitude, the natural order of things. Mostly, I’m offering me. I think
we’re beautiful, Herb.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You make it sound almost plausible.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t know why you even hesitate. What’s
holding you here? Is it your wife?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: No, that’s all over. I suppose if I’m married
to anything, it’s this hospital. It’s been my whole life. I just can’t
walk out on it as if it never mattered. I’m middle-class. Among us
middle-class, love doesn’t triumph over all. Responsibility does.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Herb, don’t ask me to stay here with you,
because I love you, and I will. And we’ll both be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ve got the bill here to pay yet.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: Herb, you asked me to find that dialysis
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What dialysis nurse?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ll go pay the bill.</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: The one who goofed on your patient,
Drummond.</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: Well, her name is Theresa Campanella, but
you are not going to believe this, Herb. She died on the operating table
in O. R. Three about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What do you mean, she died on the operating
table in O.R. Three?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You mean she was the one?</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: That’s the one. I just identified her.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: What the hell’s going on around here? Every
time I try to find somebody in this hospital, they either died of a
heart attack in Emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating
room.</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: Listen, I just came from the O.R. They’re
trying to find a Dr. Schaefer. Don’t you have a kid named Schaefer in
your service?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I had a Schaefer. He died yesterday of an
overdose of insulin. What do they want Schaefer for?</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: The Holding Room nurse says there was a
Dr. Schaefer hanging around the Holding Room. It wouldn’t have been your
Schaefer anyway. The nurse says it was senior staff, a middle- aged
man.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: There’s no senior staff named Schaefer in this
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>lagerman</strong>: I told them that. I said, I don’t know any
senior staff around here named Schaefer. They’ve got detectives down
there, everything. It’s a whole big investigation.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete
of Caborca.</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Dad! What the
hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We all thought you were at Death’s Door!
What’re you doing out of bed?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What happened? Did he say anything to
you?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: As a matter of fact, he said, “I am the Fool
for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca.” And you’d better close the
door, because if he’s going to tell everyone who walks in here he’s the
Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca, they’ll put us all away.
He’s already killed two doctors and one nurse.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I am the wrath of the lamb and the angel
of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do you mean he killed two doctors and
a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I mean, he’s killed two doctors and a nurse!
And he just tried to kill me! He has something against doctors. Somehow
he got hold of a thousand units of insulin and put it in Dr. Schaefer’s
intravenous solution. And somehow he got Dr. Ives to die of a heart
attack in the middle of the Emergency Room. And somehow he got a
dialysis nurse named Campanella to die of anesthesia shock on an
operating table! He’s been running around the hospital wearing
Dr. Schaefer’s uniform. Right now, they’re looking all over the place
for this mysterious Dr. Schaefer. I know this all sounds as grotesque to
you as it does to me, but you can see for yourself your father is not
the helpless comatose patient we thought he was. Don’t look at me like
I’m the one who’s crazy. Ask your crazy father!</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I was merely an instrument of God. I
killed no one. They all three died by their own hands, ritual victims of
their own institutions, murdered by irony, an eye for an eye, biblical
retribution. Schaefer was first, you see, because he killed God. God was
admitted to this hospital last Monday under the name of Guernsey…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I was instantly aware of a divine
presence.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I was convinced this porcelain old man
was, in fact, an Angel of the Lord…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …perhaps even Christ Himself.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Our Savior was, it seems, suffering from
emphysema.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: He was relentlessly subjected to the
benefits of modern medicine. He was misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and put
into shock by Dr. Schaefer; raced off to Intensive Care, where the
resident compounded the blunder and induced a coma. I can tell you with
authority that God is indeed dead. He died last Monday under the name of
Guernsey.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: A few hours later, he appeared to me in a
revelation.</p>
<p><strong>guernsey</strong>: Rise up, Drummond. You are dead, now you
are restored.</p>
<p><strong>drummond’s p.o.v.</strong>: Guernsey, dressed only in his
hospital shift, is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room, hands
clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European intellectual, head
hunched forward – a little old man with a white beard talking to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>guernsey</strong>: Those who killed you and those who killed
me will die in our place. You are the Paraclete of Caborca, the wrath of
the lamb. The angel of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p><strong>guernsey</strong>: In this fashion has it been revealed to
you.</p>
<p><strong>guernsey</strong>: The age is closed! The end is at hand! The
seal is broken!</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Well! Not quite the burning bush perhaps
but prodigal enough for me. I was to avenge the death of God and my own
brutalization. I was to kill Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck and the
dialysis nurse Miss Campanella, whose negligence caused my coma.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I awaited a further sign from God, which
was given to me later that evening. Dr. Schaefer, it seems, had arranged
an assignation with a girl from the hematology lab named Sheila.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. Hey
listen, I got us a bed for tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: What’s this in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: That’s my insulin. Put it back.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: What do you take insulin for? Diabetes? I
didn’t know you were a diabetic.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It ain’t contagious, don’t worry about
it.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And you put Schaefer’s insulin into the I.V.
jar.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Yes. And then a second nurse came and
plugged the I.V. jar into Schaefer. God clearly intended a measure of
irony here. The hospital was to do all the killing for me. All I need do
was arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital.
Accordingly, the next morning, I set out for Dr. Ives. I put on
Dr. Schaefer’s uniform, pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a
sandbag from a utility cart, and found my way to Dr. Ives’ laboratory. I
coshed him with the sandbag, gave him a massive shot of the digoxine.
This, you see, brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia.
When he came to, I brought him down to the Emergency Room.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: This is Dr. Ives. He’s in the Nephrology
Lab. I was in there a little while ago, and he was suddenly taken ill,
and I thought I’d better get him over here right away.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: He had at that time perhaps an hour to
live. Prompt treatment would have saved his life.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: As a staff doctor, he was seen without
preliminaries…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: His vital signs were taken, an
electrocardiogram…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …which revealed occasional ventricular
premature contractions. An intern took his history…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …and then he was promptly…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …simply… forgotten to death. Simply
mislaid…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …mislaid among the broken wrists, the
chest pains, scalp lacerations, the man whose fingers were crushed in a
taxi door, the infant with the skin rash, the child swiped by a car, the
old lady mugged in the subway, the derelict beaten by sailors, the
teenage suicide, the paranoids, drunks, asthmatics, the rapes, the
septic abortions, the overdosed addicts…</p>
<p><strong>ambulance attendants</strong>: Not breathing! Not
breathing!</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Better put him in the Holding Room.</p>
<p><strong>miss aronovici</strong>: She’s taking a little pulse.</p>
<p><strong>dr. spezio</strong>: Get an anesthesiologist, one-five-
one-five…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: …the fractures, infarcts, hemorrhages,
concussions, boils, abrasions, the colonic cancers, the cardiac arrests
– the whole wounded madhouse of our times…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I wonder if I could have a minute of
your time, Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I am the fool for Christ and the Paraclete
of Caborca.</p>
<p><strong>nameless man</strong>: Well, it’s an honor and a privilege,
Doctor. I’ve been here ten minutes, I can’t seem to get anybody to help
me. I’m suffering from some sort of amnesia. I can’t remember my name.
As a matter of fact, it’s pretty screwy. I got mugged. Two hours ago,
walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty- Seventh Street and Second Avenue,
eight o’clock in the morning, broad daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen-
year-old girl walks up to me, shows me a knife about a yard long and
says, “Give me your wallet.” I thought she was kidding. I mean there’s
hundreds of people walking right by. Well, she wasn’t kidding. “Listen,”
I said, “all I got’s about twenty bucks.” So she takes the wallet
anyway. So I said, “How about leaving me my identification?” I mean, I
had my driver’s license, my Diner’s Club, my credit cards. But she took
them all, the whole damn wallet, credit cards, everything. So I stopped
some guy, I said, “Hey, you see that girl there, walking away?” He says,
“Yeah.” I said, “She just stole my wallet, credit cards and everything.”
He says, “Well, that’s what they want, the credit cards.” So I started
looking for a cop. I mean, go find a cop, right? Well, I finally find a
cop. The girl’s halfway to South America by now, probably bought the
ticket with my credit cards. So the cop says, “What’s your name?” And
you want to know something? I couldn’t think of my name. The girl took
all my identification, you know what I mean? She took all my credit
cards. So I said, “You know this is screwy. I can’t think of my name.”
So he took me to the station house. The sergeant says, “What’s your
name?” I said, “I don’t know! She took all my credit cards!” So they
took me down here. So what do you think, Doctor? I’m nuts, right? I
finally flipped.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cushing</strong>: Who’s number 7-6-8-0-2-S? Is there
anybody here who is that number?</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: In this way was it revealed to me the
manner of Nurse Campanella’s death. She was to die of the great American
plague – vestigial identity.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: So last night, I coshed Miss Campanella
with a sandbag, sedated her with thorazine, shaved her, prepped her, and
parked her in a corridor of the X-Ray Department for five hours.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Why X-Ray?</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Well, at X-Ray, a sedated body lying
around unattended for five hours wouldn’t seem unusual.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Her operation – that is to say,
Mrs. Mangafranni’s operation – was not scheduled until nine-thirty. So
at nine-fifteen this morning, I rang for my nurse…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You rang for your nurse?</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: To insure one full hour of uninterrupted
privacy.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella off to
the operating rooms, replaced her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni’s, exchanged
charts and identity bracelets. She died officially of anesthesia shock.
But, in point of fact, she died because she was wearing another woman’s
identity.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: God, what do we do now? Let me take him
back to Mexico. It’s a simple world there. If you turn him in, they’ll
just cage him in the Rockland State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.
Let me take him back, Herb.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Are you kidding? We’ll both take him. I’m
going with you! Get him dressed. We’re getting out of here before the
police put us all in Rockland State.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: I haven’t finished my work here. I have
this Welbeck to dispose of. I am the angel of the bottomless pit and the
wrath of the lamb.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh dear, he’s having another
revelation.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Look, that ambulance must be here by now. You
go down and get them. I’ll give him a shot of something to knock him
out. We’ll take him to the airport in the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: You’re hallucinating again.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: …Edwards never showed up. I’m short-
staffed as hell. It’s just me and Felicia. It’s like Sunday. Nobody’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. biegelman</strong>: I’ll be at lunch…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Yeah, you gotta send me somebody… Oh
yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mead</strong>: We’ll be in Eight-O-Six.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: …then what did she say?</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I’m Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on this
floor named Drummond, and I’d like to see his chart.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Oh, Dr. Bock. Can I have a few minutes of
your time, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Dr. Gilley tells me you’re the one who
initiated these proceedings against me.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m busy, Welbeck.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I’d like to know what you have against
me.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You turned up half-stoned for a simple
nephrectomy eight days ago, botched it, put the patient into failure and
damn near killed him. Then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew
off on the wings of man to an island of sun in Montego Bay. This is the
third time in two years we’ve had to patch up your patients; the other
two died. You’re greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self-inflating
and unconscionably profitable. Aside from that, I have nothing against
you. I’m sure you play a hell of a game of golf. What else do you want
to know?</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Excuse me for a moment, Doctor. This is
Dr. Welbeck. Were you paging me? How much do you make a year, Bock? For
a guy who makes a lousy forty, fifty grand… Hello, Arthur, I understand
you’ve been trying to reach me all morning…</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I’m telling you, Milton, he pulls out
all the wires and the tubes, and he gets up and puts on a doctor’s
uniform, and he goes out, and he murders doctors! He just went out ten
seconds before you came in!</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: And I’ll tell you something else about
this crazy place you got here! There was a naked Indian in here last
night doing a war dance! That’s the kind of crazy place you’re running
here, Milton! You got to get me out of here, Milton. This is a crazy
place, Milton!</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I wake up last night, there’s a goddam
Indian in here, a naked Indian! What kind of hospital is this?</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: This is Mr. Mead, are you paging
me?</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: A couple of hours later I wake up
again, and the guy in that bed there is getting out of the bed…</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Are the police still in the
building?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: You’d better get them up here. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: All day long, he lays there like a
dead man. All of a sudden, in the middle of the night, he gets out of
bed! I thought I was going crazy!</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Yes, this is Mead… Oh, dear. When?…</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: You know what he says to me? He says,
you’re hallucinating. Listen, I just saw a naked Indian. Now, I’m seeing
a ghost. I got to figure he’s right, I’m hallucinating, right?</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: I’ll be down directly. Never rains but
it pours. A fire just broke out in one of those condemned buildings. The
squatters in the building came out. The police tried to arrest them and,
apparently, the situation has erupted into a riot. I’m sure you’re
wondering what this is all about, Herb.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: You’re not going to leave me alone in
this crazy place, Milton!</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Mr. Hitchcock is staying with you. You
better call the cops, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: Milton! Milton! Milton!!!</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: I haven’t the time now, and I’m not
even going to try to tell you this curious story my brother just told
me. I’ll fill you in on it at lunch some time.</p>
<p><strong>milton mead</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The ambulance is here.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yeah, but your father isn’t. He’s disappeared.
He put on Schaefer’s uniform and has gone out to do God’s work,
presumably the murder of Dr. Welbeck. Except, that fellow on the phone
over there is Dr. Welbeck.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Oh my God, Arthur! What are you talking
about? Have you talked to Dr. Hogan about this?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: And, on top of everything else, the other
patient in your father’s room overheard his whole confession and just
told the Chief Administrator of the hospital. They’re sending for the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Oh, my God, Arthur. Well, who held title?
Do the underwriters know about this yet?… Oh my God! Arthur, what’re you
waiting for? Arrest the son of a bitch! Turn him in!… Oh my God! When?…
Of course, Arthur, call me right back. I’m at the Holly Pavilion, Eighth
Floor. Please! Right away!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Are you all right, Welbeck?</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: All right?! That son of a bitch is trying
to wipe me out! My partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel
Hogan, is a miserable thief. And he’s trying to wipe me out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Mr. Drummond’s chart, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: What room is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Eight-O-Six.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I’m expecting a phone call. Put it straight
through to me in that room.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: The son of a bitch has been draining the
company with phony purchase orders on another company, of which, it now
turns out, his wife is the principal stockholder! Transparent fraud!
I’ll send him up for twenty years!</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Well, Drummond, you don’t seem that much
the worse for the wear.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Would you mind using some other phone? I’m
expecting an important call.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: What is this? Who… who is this
guy?</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Yes, well, I’ll be at the Nurses’ Desk,
Sergeant. It would be futile for me to try to explain this to you over
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: You’ve got a bit of fever, Drummond, but
you’re coming along very well.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I’m not Drummond, you monkey!
Drummond’s the other bed!</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: That’s mine. It’s Welbeck here… Yes,
Arthur, go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I’m getting out of this nuthouse!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: All right, take it easy, Mr. Mead.</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I came in here just to get a lousy
polyp cut out.</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: Oh, my God, what do you mean? How many
transactions were there? Bu… but Arthur, I… I borrowed against that
stock! I’m in the hole for over three hundred thousand!…</p>
<p><strong>william mead</strong>: I’m a sick man! I’m supposed to have
peace and quiet!</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: What do you mean, Brazil?! I just spoke to
Hogan’s office yesterday, and they just told me…</p>
<p><strong>welbeck</strong>: I’m wiped out. The S.E.C. has suspended
trading in my stock!</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Cardiac arrest, Holly Eight.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We have an emergency here.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Breathe him.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: C.A.C. Holly Eight. Please clear all
corridors.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Where’s Biegelman?</p>
<p><strong>chandler</strong>: He went to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Natch. Get that other bed out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: others begin moving William Mead’s bed</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s been happening?</p>
<p><strong>chandler</strong>: Nursing Supervisor</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: C.A.C. Holly Eight. Please clear all
corridors.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: In here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Dr. Robert Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>chandler</strong>: One of the patients had a cardiac
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: What do you have, Dr. Bock?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Total cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Dr. Rigby. Dr. Rigby. Dr. Lilac.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: How long has he been like this?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: About a minute. No pulse, no heartbeat, no
respiration…</p>
<p><strong>dr. loomis</strong>: All right, I’ll take over.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Endotrachial tube.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: I’m sorry, Doctor, but we have another
emergency in 823.</p>
<p><strong>chandler</strong>: Endotrachial tube.</p>
<p><strong>dr. loomis</strong>: Shall we get him up on the cart?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: All right, who is this patient? What’s
the story on this patient?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Is this his chart, Dr. Bock?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: What’s his name? Drummond?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Yes, his name’s Drummond. That’s his
chart.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Oh Christ, the poor son of a bitch just
had a nephrectomy a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Was it Drummond?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. donovan</strong>: Who else would it be?</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Pick him up. Put him on it. Stop the
massage.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Ventricular fibrillation. Get me the
paddles. Push another amp of bicarb.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Set it for two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That’s two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Everybody bock away.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: One-two-three…</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Did he convert?</p>
<p><strong>dr. loomis</strong>: No, he’s still fibrillating.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Let’s go to four hundred.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>their p.o.v.</strong>: looking down onto the U-shaped drive
of the entrance plaza of the hospital and First Avenue full of traffic.
A band of some fifty black and Puerto Rican youths, including females
and young white revolutionaries, most in Che Guevara garb, have broken
past the security guards at the gates and spill across the drive. Some
policemen and security guards move tentatively out of the hospital to
intercept them.</p>
<p><strong>nursing supervisor</strong>: It’s four hundred.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Everybody back One-two-three…</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: That didn’t work either.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: All right. Let me have a c.c. of
Adrenaline and intercardiac needle.</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Stop the massage. Ventricular
fibrillation. Put another amp of bicarb. Two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: the traffic rumbling heedlessly around</p>
<p><strong>dr. morse</strong>: Hang isopril, two in five hundred. Let’s
take one more crack with the paddles. Everybody back off the cart.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: They can’t get him out of fib. I don’t think
he’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>hitchcock</strong>: Thank God. This should close the case,
Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Everybody take it easy! Nobody’s going to be
hurt! We just want the Director!</p>
<p><strong>shouting crowd</strong>: We want Sundstrom! We want
Sundstrom! Community control! Community control! Hip-hip-Hippocrates! Up
with service! Down with fees!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: You people want to see me?</p>
<p><strong>first militant</strong>: Yeah, baby, we want to see you…</p>
<p><strong>second militant</strong>: We’re taking over this hospital,
man…</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: I’ve had it up to here. I’m not dealing
with this kind of cheap blackmail!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Now look, man. Now wait a minute there!</p>
<p><strong>first militant</strong>: We’re looking for a hostage!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Fourteen people just got arrested for
doing…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lookit, man, where’s the TV camera?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Would you be cool, man? Fourteen people got
arrested for doing nothing but living in their homes, which you people
threw them out of.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Right on!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: So now we’re going to arrest you. We’re
going to hold you hostage and we ain’t letting you go un…</p>
<p><strong>ambler</strong>: We, the members of the Doctors Liberation
Committee indict this hospital for the criminal neglect of the community
in which it is situated! We demand an immediate dissolution of the
governing and executive boards.</p>
<p><strong>shout</strong>: What are you going to do about those fourteen
ghetto people?</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: I am not going to do anything… about
anything.</p>
<p><strong>shout</strong>: Yes, you are!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: By God, if you want to take over this
hospital, you take it over!</p>
<p><strong>shouts</strong>: We will! Right on!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: You run it! I am finished! I quit! You
run it! You pay the bills! You fight the city!</p>
<p><strong>militant</strong>: We will!</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: You fight the state! You fight the
unions. You fight the community! You… you think you can do a better job,
you do it! Now I am finished! I quit! It’s all yours!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Quit! Quit!</p>
<p><strong>shouts of cops</strong>: All right, come on… come on – Let’s
clear the area. – Come on, let’s clear this place… Keep cool. Everybody
keep cool.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Let those who are in Judea flee to the
mountains, for the age is closed, the season of the seventh seal is at
hand! The age is closed! The season of the seventh se…</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Dr. Welbeck is dead. They thought he was
you.</p>
<p><strong>drummond</strong>: Yes, I know. We must arrange to have his
body shipped to my Apache village where we will bury him with full
tribal rites. In a day or two, somebody’ll ask, “Whatever happened to
Dr. Welbeck?” And it will be assumed he absconded to Brazil to join his
partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan. Welbeck, too,
was mislaid, overlooked, forgotten to death, you see.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We have to hurry, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: I’m not going. The hospital’s coming apart. I
can’t walk out on it when it’s coming apart. Somebody has to be
responsible, Barbara. Everybody’s hitting the road, running to the
hills, running away. Somebody’s got to be responsible. Kennedy Airport.
You’ve got a two- thirty flight to make.</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: You going back in?</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sundstrom</strong>: It’s like pissing in the wind, right,
Herb?</p>
<p><strong>bock</strong>: Right.</p>
