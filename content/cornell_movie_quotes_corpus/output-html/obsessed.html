<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Derek?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are you going to do with that?</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - minutes later</strong>: The SOLD sign, now
in pieces, burns brightly in the fireplace. The rest of the room is
empty except for KYLE who is nearby, asleep in his stroller. Derek and
Beth’s VOICES drift down from upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice</strong>: This is coming down.</p>
<p><strong>derek’s voice</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice</strong>: Do you want people to think we put it
up?</p>
<p><strong>derek’s voice</strong>: I don’t know. I kind of like it.</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice</strong>: Please tell me you’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All I’m saying, before we take it down… maybe
we should try it out.</p>
<p>****: You know. Christen the new house.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: And what do you suggest we use for a bed?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do we need a bed for when we’ve got a
fine shag carpet?</p>
<p>****: Because I’m gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my
–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Told `em I’d be late.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What about…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Kyle? That boy wouldn’t wake up if a nuclear
bomb went off.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Maybe not, but the movers…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Won’t be here for another hour.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Derek, you are so bad.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Isn’t THAT why you married me?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Want me to stay? Crack the whip on these
guys?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. Go to work and earn that promotion.
Somebody’s got to pay for all this.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Gage/Bendix?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I couldn’t help but notice we’re both going to
Seven.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Right. Gage/Bendix. I work there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I thought you might.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Do you have an appointment with us?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why? Do I look like a client?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Actually, you do.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: ell, I hate to shatter the illusion but I’m just
a lowly temp.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re a temp?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Just here for the day.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, you could have fooled me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m beginning to think these heels were a big
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No problem. Happen to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Thanks. I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No. I’m taking these files to Mister Charles’
office. They said it was this way.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Derek Charles?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I guess you probably know him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh, yeah, I know him. Kind of an asshole,
takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don’t tell him I said that.
L</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: I could get you into trouble?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Deep trouble.</p>
<p><strong>atrick</strong>: Morning, Derek. How’s the new house?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as
soon as the movers showed up.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Beth must have loved that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If she calls mad – and she will – tell her
I’m in a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Remember who used to sit at this desk?
She’ll know I am lying.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s Derek Charles?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: Watch it, girl. He’s married.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The good ones are always married.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Or straight.</p>
<p><strong>age</strong>: Did you talk to our German friend, Herr
Ganz?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Matter of fact, I just got off the line to
Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Ganz doesn’t like the way the Stock Market’s
been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest.</p>
<p><strong>age</strong>: You think he’s right?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hell, no. I think he’s a hundred percent
wrong. We haven’t even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand
is coming from individual investors which is why it’s gaining mainstream
acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes
mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to
talk him into a private equity portfolio instead… to the tune of 155
mil.</p>
<p>****: I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: None taken, Joe. I’m just honored to be allowed
to exist in Derek’s world.</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Good. I want you to throw Derek all your
support on this one.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hat’s when Lisa walks by on the other side of the
glass. Gage perks up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Never seen `em before.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I think she’s one of the temps.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean temptress…</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Remind me to call that agency and have them
send over a couple more just like her. Doesn’t hurt to have a little eye
candy around the office, does it, boys?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow
night. Think you can get free?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m moving into a new house.</p>
<p><strong>en</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Do I look like a man who wants a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>en</strong>: I could call and say it’s a work emergency.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Thanks, but I think I’ll stay married
instead.</p>
<p>****: Coward.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Good night, Mister Charles.</p>
<p>****: Sorry but you set me up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll get my revenge. And by the
way, you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees
with you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: About Derek Charles being an asshole. They all
say he’s the nicest guy in the firm.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, that just proves he’s got `em all
fooled.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And he’s humble, too. I’m Lisa, by the way.
Lisa Sheridan.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan.
Good luck with your next job –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Actually, they’re keeping me on a few more
days, so I’ll probably see you on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Damn. Almost made it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey, little man. What’s wrong? You should be…
Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’ve been changing him all day.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Whew. What’s that woman been feeding you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, we toasted the house –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Toasted Kyle –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your promotion –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: But I’ve saved the most important toast for
last… To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: And to my handsome husband. I asked for the
moon and he gave me the stars.</p>
<p>****: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How would you feel about trying out that
mirror again? This time in our own bed.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test
drive?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You know how I like looking at your sexy
butt.</p>
<p>****: Beth, you are so bad.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Isn’t that WHY you married ME?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hi. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp. Where’s
Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Out with the flu. I did some trading with the
other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Uh… sure.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Good morning, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Grab your pad and follow me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I put a memo on your desk about the Christmas
party this Friday.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Is it that time already?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why don’t they invite spouses?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: To the Christmas party. It says “for employees
only.”</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s like that in most companies. They think
people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick
back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the
party is about.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: So, does this party get pretty wild?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Just the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well that’s no fun.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: called Patrick. He said you like it</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No, it’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, it’s Monday and first thing on
Monday…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I took care of that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Took care of what?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen
long-stemmed red roses. I called to confirm they’ve been delivered.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I think that’s incredibly sweet. How long have
you two been married?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Three years in March.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And you still send her flowers every Monday
morning? Lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s kind of a tradition.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Patrick said you started sending them back
when Beth worked here as your assistant. Is that how you won her
heart?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, it took a little more than roses. We
need to run some calls.</p>
<p>****: Ready when you are.</p>
<p>****: Are you always this efficient?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Does that surprise you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, it’s just that most of the temps we get
here…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I think you’ll find I’m not your typical
temp.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. Definitely not.</p>
<p>****: Okay not your typical temp… start with Phil Trendle at Emerson…
set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water
Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No. Go faster. I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s a beautiful little park with a duck pond
and close enough to push Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. It’s shaping up to be a work
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You can work at home and then we’ll go to the
barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling.
Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to
the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead,
she’s not at her desk. She’s standing several feet away at a file
cabinet. She turns and smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Do you need me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Work at the office. This is home. Come to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: In a sec.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The card that came today with the roses…</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: … was addressed “To Betty.”</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Betty?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your other wife?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called in
sick and I had a temp on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: I thought we had a deal. No female
assistants.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Honey, I don’t control the temp pool.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She pretty?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah, she’s pretty… plain.</p>
<p>****: I don’t care. I want her fired immediately.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Actually, she did a great job… aside from the
card.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: Night, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Night… Betty.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hope you don’t mind us dropping in
unannounced.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You kidding? This is a treat.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Sheila’s meeting us for lunch at Central
Market. Then I’m taking Kyle to the Grove. And who are we going to see
at the Grove?</p>
<p>****: Santa!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You want to come? Get your picture taken on
Santa’s lap?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’d love to but I’m all jammed up. But say hi
to your sister.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That guy she was seeing, the one we met at
Thanksgiving… Jack.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: The one she said was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Apparently he’s not so perfect. He told her he
just wants to be FWB.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Friends With Benefits.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You know. Sex but no commitments.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And Sheila’s got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lisa, this is my wife Beth. Beth, Lisa. She’s
temping for Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s great to meet you, Mrs. Charles. And this
must be Kyle. I can already tell he’s going to grow up to be a
heartbreaker.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Kyle, say hello.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: He can say hello. He’s usually not this shy
around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What a handsome boy. He looks just like
you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Actually, most people think he takes after
Beth.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Talk about the perfect family. The three of
you should be on a magazine cover.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I hope my husband’s not working you too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He is. But I like it. I’m learning a lot. Joe
Gage needs to see you when you get a minute.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, that’s our cue to leave. We just dropped
in to say hi. Come on, big boy.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It was great to meet you… Beth.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: You, too… Laura.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s Lisa. You said Laura.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I did?</p>
<p>****: Bye, Kyle. Say hi to Santa for me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That was intentional.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Wasn’t me. Blame “Betty.” So what’s the deal
with her?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: So she was obviously listening at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, she probably didn’t know when to come
in.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that
girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How would I know? I only have eyes for you.
B</p>
<p>****: Oh, you are so slick.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on. I’ll walk you to the elevator. You
can say hi to the old gang.</p>
<p>****: Ever miss it?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I like to think I traded up.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Hey, Patrick. Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Much. Thanks.</p>
<p>****: You know it’s going to take more than the flu to keep me away
from that Christmas party.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Not sure we can say the same for Marge…</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: You get around don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Poor thing called in with a fever…</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah… She’s not speaking to me at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Alright. You two behave yourselves out
here…</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So, how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek’s calls?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m way too devious to ever get caught.
Besides, I thought all you assistants listened in.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How long have you worked here?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Ten years this Spring.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: I’ll bet you know more about what goes on
behind these closed doors than anybody.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Oh you got that right girl. I know all the
dirty little secrets.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Well maybe we should grab a drink some night
after work for a little girl talk.</p>
<p>****: Listen, honey, if you think you can buy my silence with a
couple of Cosmo’s… you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Sorry. I thought everybody was at lunch.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. Stay. I was just gonna take this back to
my office.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Most people I know don’t cry over
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You think I was crying? This is just my
allergies.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Uh huh. What are you allergic to?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Men, apparently. Actually it’s more like
they’re allergic to me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Boyfriend trouble?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s stupid really. This guy I’ve been seeing
just calls and dumps me. Middle of the day. No warning. No explanation.
Just “I don’t think we should see each other anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: OUCH!!! That’s pretty cold. How long were you
together?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Two months. Actually, it was one of my longer
lasting relationships. I don’t know what it is but sooner or later I
just seem to scare men off.</p>
<p>****: I’m starting to think there’s something wrong with me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nothing wrong with you. Your boyfriend’s a
fool, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I wish I could believe that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Maybe you just haven’t met the right guy
yet.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m beginning to think all the good ones are
taken. D</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Look, I’m no expert but if it didn’t work out,
maybe it wasn’t meant to be. When the right guy comes along… you’ll know
it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Is that how it was with you and Beth?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Actually, yeah. We both knew pretty
quick.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Love at first sight?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It does happen.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Great. Now I’m jealous.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s got it all. Perfect husband, perfect
child, perfect marriage.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Nobody’s perfect. There are problems in every
relationship. The important thing is to keep moving forward. Don’t get
down on yourself. You’re a bright, attractive girl. Any man would be
lucky to have you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No, really. If I was single…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I just meant…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know. You’re just trying to make me feel
better. And you have.</p>
<p>****: Hang in there. It’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: en appears in the doorway, grins at Derek.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really? I wouldn’t mind taking up the slack.
That is one hot piece of ass there. Like you haven’t noticed.</p>
<p>****: Hey, I’m a happily married man. And so are you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Doesn’t mean we can’t look.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Ben, if you’re looking to start something
with that girl…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You saw her first?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Besides, I don’t think I’m her type. Now you on
the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Ben, do me a favor…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All I’m just sayin’ is a lot of these single
gals see the work place as a hunting ground. And this one’s got you in
the cross hairs.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: On your way home, can you pick up those Baby
Einstein DVD’s for you know who.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll have to do it tomorrow. Office party’s
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I forgot. Well, if you drink too much, take a
cab, okay?</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: If it’s anything like last year, I’ll be home
early.</p>
<p>****: Kyle, I want you to eat this.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Santa!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah, Santa. And he’s coming soon. So eat.
Don’t you know Santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their
food?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. Be my guest…</p>
<p>****: Still the best burger in town.</p>
<p>****: … And the best Margarita.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We used to cut loose here after a long day at
work.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Work hard, play hard. Right?</p>
<p>****: Back in the day…</p>
<p>****: How’s that boyfriend trouble coming?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Keep moving forward, right?</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How about you, Derek? What’s the grand
plan?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You know, run the company by 35. Jet by 40.
Retire to my private island and own the Lakers by 50.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Lakers suck.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not with me in charge.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: You want one?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A margarita?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: C’mon big talker… it’s Christmas time. Works
dead –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All right. One. What do you like?
Strawberry?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Rocks. Salt…</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Well, if it isn’t the Office Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s Mister Office Asshole to you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m impressed. You can dance.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All those years watching Soul Train.</p>
<p>****: I wasn’t sure I was going to come tonight.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, it’s not like I’ve been here that
long.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m sure everybody’s glad you decided to show
up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Even you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do you mean “even me?” I’m your number
one supporter around here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: How did that get there?</p>
<p>****: Maybe a quick one on the cheek? If we don’t, people will really
suspect there’s something going on.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Guess we’ll just have to take that
chance.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Coward.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re not thinking about bailing, are you?
Fun’s just getting started. Remember last year? Sally Sloane did a table
dance.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e indicates a pretty secretary LAUGHING and
accepting another drink.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: With Beth and Kyle. I’m gonna take a piss and
sneak out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re no fun.</p>
<p>****: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you out of your –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, come on…</p>
<p>****: Hey, who’s there?</p>
<p>****: Don’t do this…</p>
<p>****: Wait. Where are you going?</p>
<p>****: You’ve got the wrong idea!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Living dangerously, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, Patrick, you’re such an old queen.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Dance with me.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: ’ll bet you’ve never been this close to an actual
woman.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Honey, I’ve never been this close to an
actual man.</p>
<p>****: How was the party?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I only stayed for two drinks.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That dull, huh?</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Beth…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Not tonight, honey, okay? I’m really
tired.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You okay, bro?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You should have stuck around.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The Christmas party. Hank in Human Services
tossed his cookies on the Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Really? Sorry I missed that.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Bad time?</p>
<p>****: No…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Joe wants to know if you’re done with the Ganz
portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Tell him he’ll have it end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re working Joe’s desk?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Just for today. He’s a real screamer, isn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t let him fool you. His bark really is as
bad as his bite.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Okay if I take off?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah, go home.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: What are you –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I owe you an apology for the Christmas party.
I think I sort of took you by surprise.</p>
<p>****: We both had a few drinks. Just forget it. L</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: What if I can’t?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lisa… nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All right, have it your way. Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You really need to get out of my car.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: This is so not right.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Relax. Nobody’s around to see us now. God, I
almost went insane today, didn’t you? Having to go pretend like I was
concentrating on work when all I could think about –</p>
<p>****: Lisa, get out of my car!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek, what’s wrong? What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know if you’re just dense or what’s
wrong with you but I want you to understand something. There’s nothing
going on between us. I would never – never – jeopardize my job with a
co- worker.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Maybe you are an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p>****: Beth? Honey?</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There’s something I need to…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’ve been on the phone for the last hour</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She found out Tim’s been having an
affair with a neighbor and it’s been going on for the last year and a
half.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Tim? Really?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: At first I couldn’t even conceive of it.
They’ve always seemed to be so much in love, totally devoted to each
other.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Tim… told her?</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: Just blurted it out last night when he came
home from work. Then he said he was moving out. You know they’ve got
three kids. Poor Rachel’s a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah. That’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Tough? It’s a disaster. If it was me…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth, you know I’d never cheat on you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Tim’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: He’s a son of a bitch. What did you want to
tell me?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Forget it. Just a little problem at work.</p>
<p>****: Nothing I can’t take care of.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There was nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nothing to tell? She grabbed your cock? Flashed
her tits in your car? Come on, man. I thought I was your best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You think this is funny?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just… jeez. I mean, I kinda got she was
interested but I never figured she’d…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the hell did I do? I was nice to her,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>en</strong>: Sure you didn’t lead her on? Just a little? I
mean, a pretty girl… it would be normal…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I didn’t do a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe she thinks she can make the jump from
assistant to wife, too?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Thanks. You’re a big help.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry… What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Report it to Human Resources…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Get her fired?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d be very careful if I were you. What if she
makes trouble and says you came on to her?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: erek gives Ben a look. C’mon man…</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Then I need to get my side on the record
first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wouldn’t it be cheaper to just have her
killed?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Morning, Mister Charles.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hi, Connie. Is Hank in? I need to talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Derek? That you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, it’s sort of a personal matter. I need
to talk to you about one of the temps, Lisa Sheridan.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Right. She worked your desk for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Listen, Hank, this going to be a little
awkward…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: If you’re here to file a complaint about her
performance, save your breath. Her agency called this morning and said
she wouldn’t be coming in any more. They already sent over a
replacement.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: She quit? They give a reason?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: No. Did you have some kind of a problem with
her?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, I just thought she was unqualified,
sort of in over her head. But if she already quit…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Looks like she beat you to it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: How’s the new house?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: New house is great. Couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Tell Beth I said hi.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I will. Listen. We’ll have you and Kathy over
some night when we’re more settled.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She quit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>en</strong>: Come on, bro. That’s good news. Problem
solved.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Looks that way, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not a bad little Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hans? Derek. How was your Christmas? Well,
you people invented it. You got the prospectus? Great. Look it over. I
think it’s gonna be a happy new year for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: God, it’s after three. That’s the last time
I’m going out on New Years Eve. Next year we’ll celebrate here at home.
Just you, me and Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m just gonna check my e-mail and come to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Can’t it wait?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s already tomorrow in Berlin. Ganz was
supposed to send me his approval. That’s probably him.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: little fearful, Derek pulls up the first e-mail.
It opens</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ganz?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nothing. I gotta get a new spam blocker.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Forget it. He’ll call you in the morning. Come
to bed.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: erek stiffens. Then, tentatively, he opens the
new e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Remember the last time Joe had one of his
weekend work retreats?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How could I forget? I had a hangover for a
week after.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Any women coming this year?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No, just the usual suspects. Joe says it’s
going to be a male bonding experience.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I can just picture you guys in the hotel
jacuzzi, getting in touch with your innermost feelings.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hopefully, they’ll all get drunk and crash
early. Or if I’m really lucky… drown in the jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Call me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I didn’t order this.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It’s from the lady at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area. He
catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool. But
a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear, the
woman is gone.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Derek, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m fine. Just thought I saw somebody.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Somebody you know? Or somebody you’d like to
know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No way. You can’t tempt this guy.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Who could blame him with a wife like Beth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Speaking of Beth, I said I’d give her a call
before she puts Kyle to bed. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hurry back. This party’s just getting
started.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey, honey. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How’s the male bonding?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: They’re all getting wasted. Any minute now,
Joe’s going to suggest the Jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, if your future depends on putting on a
bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks… Derek? You
there?</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Wait. Kyle wants to say good night.</p>
<p>****: They’re yelling for me to come back.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’ll just take a second…</p>
<p>****: Beth, I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’ll be in bed – Derek?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I can always tell from the pained look on your
face when you’re talking to Beth.</p>
<p>****: How did you know I’d be here?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’ve got my sources. What’s wrong? You don’t
look happy to see me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You said you could never be with someone you
work with.</p>
<p>****: That’s why I quit. So we could be together.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lisa, you need to leave.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Or what? You’ll make a scene?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Call security? What would Joe and Ben
and the others think? I’ll tell you what they’d think. They’d think we
arranged it. And in a way, we did.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: One of us has to take control and I guess it’s
me. So you go back, say your good nights to the boys and I’ll be waiting
in my room. 610.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m not coming to your room.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Would you rather I came to yours?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re crazy… sick. You need help.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know. I need help. Help me, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All right, Derek. You play your games… … and
I’ll play mine.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth, I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Beth? It’s Ben. Where the hell are you,
bro?</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I’m right here. Coming back in.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on, it’s early. We’ll go to my room and
plunder the mini-bar, charge it all to Joe. D</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Can’t, man. That last drink totally kicked my
ass. I need to lie down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right, be that way. But don’t forget. Nine
o’clock in the California Room. Joe’s big rah-rah to the troops.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: erek feels the bed move… feels a tug on his
trousers… then, an amplified ZZZZIIIPPP.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Shhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No..</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hush, baby.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Housekeeping!</p>
<p>****: Later! Come back later!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Okay. I come back.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’ve got to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Leave! You’ve got to go!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek, come on…</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I want you out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why? You worried somebody’s gonna catch
us?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Just get the hell out.</p>
<p>****: We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck… fuck… fuck.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank god. We were about to send out a search
party.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sorry. Overslept.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She’s here.</p>
<p>****: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Here’s your wife, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I thought you might need an excuse to get out
of there. How about some lunch?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lunch?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s gorgeous outside and I made a reservation
at –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do you think this is?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The morning after?</p>
<p>****: We didn’t do anything last night.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But you can’t remember, can you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It didn’t happen!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek, not so loud. You’ll cause a scene.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s exactly what we</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What I should have done last night. Taking
you inside to tell Joe and the others whatever you want. They’ll know
you’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e yanks her toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why are you trying to ruin this?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Godammit!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s wrong with you? You’re acting like a
stranger.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah! That’s exactly what I am. A stranger, a
person you don’t know. Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit
lies or get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You think you can use me, then throw me away?
I’m not some piece of garbage, Derek. I’m a human being…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How else do you look at somebody who sickens
and repulses you?</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Derek, please…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t care what you do or what you say.
What goes on in that twisted mind of yours. It doesn’t matter because
the truth is, there’s never going to be anything between us. So go
ahead, Lisa… do your worst.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Derek, you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not tonight, man. I’m sticking to ice
tea.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: No. No fucking way…</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: EREK</p>
<p>****: Lisa!</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: All right, Mister Charles, let me get</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: This girl you barely know, works in your
office, fantasizes you’re having an affair and when you reject her, she
tries to commit suicide in your bed.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know how it sounds but, yeah, that’s pretty
much it.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: This affair…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There WAS NO affair.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: So she just… made it up in her head? With no
help from you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Maybe I was too nice to her, said something
she took the wrong way, I don’t know. All I know is I did not lead her
on.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: And you had no idea she’d be at the
hotel?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: None. I don’t even know how she got in my
room.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Apparently she told one of the housekeepers
she was your wife and lost her key.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Doesn’t that prove she did this on her
own?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: All it proves is she lost her key.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She never had a key.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Look, Mister Charles, I don’t care if you
were or weren’t banging this girl. I just need to get your version for
my report.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Besides, if it’s a question of
innocence, I’m not the one you have to convince.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Let’s just say I wouldn’t like to explain a
situation like this to my husband.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: They pumped her out in time. Doctor says
she’s groggy and disoriented. Probably tomorrow they’ll move her out of
ICU and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation. All suicides
are put on 72 hour hold, it’s standard.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Did she say anything?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: As a matter of fact, she was lucid long
enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency. He wrote
it down. Here.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Tell me everything. From the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How could you let this happen?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You think I encouraged it?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Maybe you liked it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What man wouldn’t? The attentions of a pretty
young girl? I can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every
time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress –</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those
things.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You must have said something. Done something
to give her the idea.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If I did, it wasn’t intentional.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: She was in your bed, Derek! You spent the night
together and you want me to believe nothing happened?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I was passed out… drunk. Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Damn you, Derek. Damn you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we
have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is
disturbed. She’s seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on
me.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. She’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You should have told me. From the very
beginning, you should have told me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: At first I thought it was no big deal. And
then… I was just embarrassed. I didn’t know how to explain it to you
without looking…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Guilty?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I said I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Did she know about us, Derek?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How we met?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t do this, Beth. You’ll make yourself
sick.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m already sick.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Honey, I know I screwed up…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know what to believe. All I know is, I
need to be alone for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I need to be alone –</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Miss Reynolds? I’m Monica Reyes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Come in. I’m sorry I’m such a mess but they
won’t let me take a shower or wash my hair. Apparently I’m still on
suicide watch.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: I’m a police officer assigned to your case.
How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well, still a bit groggy from the medication.
But it isn’t stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I’ve
caused.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Do you feel like talking about the other
night?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Have you spoken to Derek?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And he’s all right?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Relatively speaking.</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: When can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: See him?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Miss Sheridan, I don’t think Mister Charles
wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Then why did he send these?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: He sent you flowers?</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Peonies. My favorite.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: When did these show up?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: A few hours ago. They’re lovely, aren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Can you tell me what happened at the hotel,
why you were there.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Didn’t Derek tell you?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: I’d like to hear your version.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There’s not a lot to tell. We got together at
the hotel and you can guess what we did.</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: Slept together. Had sex.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Derek denies it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s just being a gentleman, trying to protect
me.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: I see. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The next day when Derek told me his wife
wouldn’t give him a divorce and that we could never see each other
again, I guess I over reacted.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t realize he was just being noble.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Noble?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle…
what the breakup might do to him. He’s not even two, you know. My
parents broke up when I was pretty young. It leaves a scar that never
really heals.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: So you believe Mister Charles is in love with
you? L</p>
<p><strong>isa</strong>: Read the card. Derek and I belong together and
nothing can change that. But I do feel bad about his wife.</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m not a home-wrecker. I’m not stealing him
away. Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial. It can’t be easy to
find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman. I just
hope she doesn’t do something foolish. You know the old saying.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: You take it easy now. We’ll talk again.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t have to tell you how an incident like
this could impact the company. Even the slightest whiff of
impropriety…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just
the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual
harassment lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There was no sexual harassment. If anything,
I’m the one who was sexually harassed.</p>
<p>****: I can’t believe this is happening to me. It’s like a
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: By now, you’re probably wishing you had fucked
her.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: OE</p>
<p>****: Sorry. Bad joke.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Goddamit, Joe, if there’s an injured party
here, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Derek, calm down. I believe you and you know
I’ll back you up all the way. But if I find out there was something
going on, I won’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s not going to happen because there’s
nothing to find out.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
Meantime I’m going to put Ben on the Ganz account.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: But Ganz is my client –</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Look, maybe you should take some time off. Just
til this blows over.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sorry to interrupt. Derek, there’s a
Detective Reyes here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She obviously ordered the flowers for
herself.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: With your credit card.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: My secretary keeps all my personal
information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was
working my desk.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: There’s more.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: More?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: This is a print out of Lisa’s blog. It’s sort
of a diary she was keeping.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: You can read them for yourself but I should
warn you they’re a little… X- rated.</p>
<p>****: This is… none of this ever happened. I was never at her
apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this…</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: According to those entries, you’re quite the
accomplished lover, Mister Charles. And you made promises to her,
promises to divorce your wife and marry her…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You can’t possibly believe this.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant.
The only thing that matters is that she believes it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There’s got to be something I can do to
protect myself… my family.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: You could file a restraining order. But that
may not be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Lisa’s left town. She was released in the
custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San
Francisco and took her back. Lisa’s agreed to check herself into a
neuropsychiatric hospital up there.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well, I can’t say I’m unhappy to hear she’s
gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: ith any luck, Mister Charles, you’ll never hear
from her again.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: “Four little ducks went out one day… over the
hill and far away…”</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’ve got our cell numbers so if there’s any
problem, don’t hesitate to call us, okay?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on, honey. Samantha knows what to do,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: I’ve got four little brothers. Trust me.
I’m really good at this.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe we should…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No way. Do you know how hard it was to get
these reservations? Come on, we agreed. This is an important night. And
I am not gonna waste you in that outfit. She looks fantastic, doesn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Like a movie star.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: erek takes Beth by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay, but you call us.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lock this. We’ll be back by ten.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I haven’t seen you looking this relaxed and
beautiful in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’d forgotten what this was like… the two of
us out together.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah. It’s been awhile.</p>
<p>****: So… there’s hope?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s not that easy.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I need you to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Derek, not everybody gets drunk and does
things they regret.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I keep telling you I didn’t do any thing to
regret.</p>
<p>****: I am telling you… you did.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: amantha is sprawled on the couch. The TV is
going, she’s listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on
her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time,
multi-tasking.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hi, I’m Beth’s friend Allie. She’s expecting
me.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Mister and Mrs. Charles are out.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Out?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: They went to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What? Beth told me to drop by. That’s strange.
Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I’ll just run up and give it to
him.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: You can’t. He’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, I won’t wake him.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Maybe you should come back.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But I’m here right now. Why should I… oh, I
see. Just doing your duty. Good girl. You know what, let me call
Beth.</p>
<p>****: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks, Samantha. Nice meeting you.</p>
<p>****: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s his birthday tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I told him we’d take him to Legoland.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll go on-line tonight and order the
tickets. Unless you think you should take him alone.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. Whatever we’re going through, he needs us
to be together.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Hey! You guys got back so fast–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Any trouble with Kyle?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: No. He was a doll.</p>
<p>****: But you just missed your friend.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What friend?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: You know. Allie? She was just here… called
you on the cell?</p>
<p>****: Nobody called me…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Someone was here? Inside the house?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: You said it was okay. She said she had
something for Kyle…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh my god! Where’s Kyle?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: In his crib.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How long since she was here?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: A couple minutes. What’s wrong?</p>
<p>****: You said it was okay!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She took him! She took my baby!</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Call 911!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Kyle…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We pumped his stomach. X-ray and cat scan
came back normal. We’ll wait for the blood work but it appears he’s
completely fine. I don’t see any reason why you can’t take Bhim home in
a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Apparently Lisa stole her sister’s ID to buy
a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today, then used her sister’s
credit card to rent a car. The sister didn’t even know she was gone
until a few hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy. She
didn’t know she checked herself out this morning…</p>
<p>****: She was in our house – alone with our son.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: he doctor says he’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, I’m not fine. I want you to find
her.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: We will. She violated the restraining order
so we can arrest her. Look, Mrs. Charles, I know you’re upset. I’m a
mother, too…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How would you feel if it was your child?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Exactly the same as you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Find her.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a
gun or something?</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: She didn’t physically harm him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No, but she could have. Is that the message
she’s trying to send?</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: Either that or…maybe she was trying to show
you she could love him. People like Lisa… their emotions can turn on a
dime. What you don’t want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I
don’t know. But there’s a good chance she’ll try to get in touch. If she
does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef
up your home security.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Derek!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The closet is open and clothes are
strewn about. Derek discovers Beth on her knees, holding up a family
photograph in which Beth’s head has been torn off.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She never left. She was here the whole
time.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: ETH</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s all right, it’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No Derek! It’s not all right!!! We have to do
something. We can’t live like this.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Right. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Guess.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re not…</p>
<p>****: I got her home number from Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: She won’t be there.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She can still pick up her messages.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth, why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>eth</strong>: I want her to know who she’s dealing with
now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: Hi, this is Lisa. I’m not here right
now so please leave a message after the beep and I’ll get back to you.
Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: isten to me, you little bitch. This is Beth
Charles and I just want you to know that if you ever… ever… come near my
child or my house again… I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>security man</strong>: You’re all set, folks. You want me to
show you how the system works?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Make sure you set this.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You don’t have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It can’t go on much longer. They’re bound to
pick her up soon.</p>
<p>****: Look, if you want me to stay, I’ll call in…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. Go to work. If anything happens, the
security patrol can be here in two minutes. Go. I can take care of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hello? Oh hi, Dad.</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Derek Charles’ office. Oh, hi, Beth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Beth’s on 2.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Thanks. Hi, honey. Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We’re fine but I had some not so great news
from my Dad.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Mom went back in for more tests. They wanted
to do another biopsy and she’s pretty scared.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m sure it’ll be fine but I thought I’d drive
down to San Diego to hold her hand, take Kyle with me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m gonna be stuck here pretty late but I
could drive down after…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good idea. Friday night
traffic’s gonna be a nightmare and they won’t know the results til
tomorrow. Why don’t you do what you need to do and drive down in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All right. Say hi to your dad and tell your
mom everything’s going to be fine, I love her. And call me when you’re
leaving the house.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I will.</p>
<p>****: Legoland?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Much more fun than Legoland. We’re going down
to Nana and Poppa’s.</p>
<p><strong>yle</strong>: Daddy, too?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. We’ll see Daddy tomorrow. Now… what toys
do you want to take?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Derek Charles’ office.</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: Hey there, girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: isa?</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: I’ve missed you, too. Everything okay
around the office?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Well, actually…</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m a little concerned. I heard the
Charles’ took out a restraining order against you.</p>
<p>****: Oh, that. That was Beth’s doing. She’s not handling this very
well. Derek’s just waiting for the right time to tell her he’s
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>atrick</strong>: I don’t think that’s gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: Of course it is…</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m not sure I should be telling you
this…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Patrick, don’t be such a drama queen. I
thought we were friends.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: We are, we are.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Well… Beth’s headed down to San Diego
tonight. Her mother is having some tests done. Derek is driving down
first thing in the morning to be by her side. Lisa? Did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: Patrick, I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: But you just…</p>
<p><strong>lisa’s voice</strong>: I’ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Wait. I wanted to tell you about my date I
last night. The one my friend set me up with? The graphic artist? Lisa,
you’d be so proud of me. I met him for drinks at –</p>
<p><strong>isa’s voice</strong>: Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>****: I really don’t care whose dick you sucked last night. I have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: isa puts the champagne bottle on the counter,
then humming happily, she begins to open shelves until she finds two
crystal champagne flutes. She takes them down. Now she looks for an ice
bucket and finds it.</p>
<p><strong>dere</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We just left the house.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Good. Did you set the alarm?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The… I think I did. I had to run back in and I
can’t remember if I re-set it.</p>
<p><strong>erek</strong>: Look, don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, I’m barely down the hill. I’ll do it and
call you back.</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice</strong>: Mommy will just be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Girl, you’re even dumber than my husband said
you were.</p>
<p>****: Or did you just forget to take your meds?</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: isa bounces off the post, stunned. Beth is on
her, slapping her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa’s hair, ripping it
out by the roots as Lisa tries to get free. Lisa lets out a subhuman
shriek of pain.</p>
<p>****: Please…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Please? Please what? Please don’t hurt
you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No!</p>
<p>****: You’re bleeding. We need to wash that off.</p>
<p>****: Please… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Too late, bitch. Sorry won’t cut it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He doesn’t love you! I’m the one he wants! Why
can’t you get that through your head?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Careful. You don’t want to fall down the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please… Beth…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, it’s Beth now? What happened to Betty?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please. I’ll go… I’ll leave… I swear I’ll
never bother you again…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: eth turns and faces Lisa with a murderous look.
Hugging the wall for support Lisa back away, leaving a bloody smear.
Beth advances.</p>
<p><strong>derek’s voice on the answering machine</strong>: Hi, you’ve
reached the Charles residence. We’re not here right now but if you have
a message for Derek…</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice on the answering machine</strong>: … or Beth… or
Kyle…. Kyle, say hello.</p>
<p>****: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>beth’s voice on the answering machine</strong>: Please wait
for the beep.</p>
<p><strong>derek’s voice</strong>: Beth? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek!</p>
<p><strong>derek’s voice</strong>: Beth?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: EREK’S VOICE</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Derek! Oh, Derek, thank god!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Derek, I’m right in the middle of something…
let me call you back.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth –</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to
force Beth over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing
positions –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Please….</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Let go of the chandelier.</p>
<p>****: No…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Let go, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: ETH</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: e come out of slow motion. Real time resumes.</p>
<p><strong>reyes</strong>: Beth? Is everything alright here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m fine. Lisa had an accident. I have to go.
My mother needs me.</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: Beth, I need to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Call me on my cell.</p>
<p><strong>eyes</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think you know what happened…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Now my child has been waiting too long.
I am sure my husband will be home soon…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s Daddy…</p>
<p>****: Beth, I spoke to Reyes. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s over, Derek–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Beth… Tell me baby– are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I should have believed you…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s gonna be okay, honey. We’re gonna be
okay–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I love you, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And I love you–</p>
