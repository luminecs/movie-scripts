<p><strong>written words</strong>: Of good family, albeit one of modest
means, she was a comely young woman and not without prospects. Therefore
it was at once heartbreaking and astonishing to her mother that she
would enter into marriage with William Munny, a known thief and
murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition.</p>
<p><strong>written words</strong>: They were married in St. Louis in
1870 and they traveled North to Kansas where he engaged in farming and
swine husbandry.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The blanket, for chrissake, cowboy, the
blanket.</p>
<p><strong>written words</strong>: She bore him two children in the
eight years of their marriage and when she died, it was not at his hands
as her mother might have expected, but of smallpox. That was in
1878.</p>
<p><strong>delilah’s voice</strong>: No, please… No, no goddamn you.</p>
<p><strong>written words</strong>: It wasn’t until 1881… three years
later… that a cowboy named Mike cut up a whore in Big Whiskey, Nebraska
in the Niobrara River country.</p>
<p><strong>mike’s voice</strong>: Davey, come a runnin’ lad an’ hold the
thieving cunt…</p>
<p><strong>mike’s voice</strong>: …brand you like a damn steer,
bitch…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hold the bitch, Davey, hold her.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: HOLD HER, DAMMIT, DAVEY! If you don’t hold her
I’ll cut her tits off.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Get Skinny, for God’s sake! SKINNY!</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: Wh-what you gonna do, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Thieving cunt, I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: Mike, don’t, Jesus, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: SKINNY! Bring your gun.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Get offa her, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: …wouldn’t let you settle it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he’s gonna
shoot ‘em… an I says, “Skinny, you can’t do that,” an’ he says, “Well,
then get Little Bill down here an’ let’s settle this” an’ I says,
“Bill’s sleepin’, Skinny,” an’…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: She ain’t gonna die, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: She’s gonna live. She didn’t steal nothin’,
She didn’t touch his poke.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: All she done was… when she seen he had a
teensy little pecker… she gave a giggle. That’s all. She didn’t know no
better.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You gonna hang ’em, Little Bill?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Clyde, step across to the German’s an’
fetch up one of his bullwhips.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: A whippin’? That’s all they get? After what
they done?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Whippin’ ain’t a little thing,
Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: But what they done, they…</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin’
ain’t gonna settle this.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: This here’s a lawful contract… betwixt me
an’ Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from
Boston, paid her expenses an’ all, an’ I got a contract which represents
an investment of capital.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Property.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring
one of their cow ponies.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You figure nobody’ll want to fuck
her.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Hell no. Leastways, they won’t pay to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: She could maybe clean up around the place or
somethin’, but nobody’s gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You boys are off of the Spade Outfit.
Got your own string of ponies?</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: I… I got f-f-f-four.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Guess you boys just as soon not have no
trial an’ fuss, huh?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Alright. You done the cuttin’… Come the
thaw, you bring in five of them ponies an’ give ’em over to Skinny
here.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Five!</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: An’ you… you give over two ponies,
hear? -</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I couldn’t find no bullwhips, Bill. The
German…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Don’t matter, we don’t need no whips.
Spring comes an’ Skinny don’t have them ponies, I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You… you ain’t even gonna… whip ’em?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I fined ’em instead.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies
an’ that’s…?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Ain’t you seen enough blood for one
night? Hell, Alice, they ain’t loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They’re
hard workin’ boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to
wickedness in a regular way…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Like whores?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Alice, tend to Delilah.</p>
<p><strong>silky</strong>: If Delilah don’t care one way or the other,
what’re you so riled about?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Just because them smelly assholes like to
ride us like horses don’t mean we got to let ‘em brand us like we’re
horses. Maybe we ain’t nothin’ but whores, but by God we ain’t
horses.</p>
<p><strong>silky</strong>: I got a hundred an’ twelve dollars. That’s
everythin’.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What about you, Faith?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Two hundred… Two hundred an’ forty.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Jesus, Faith, what you been doin’, givin’
Skinny somethin’ special?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: She laughed.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: With what Kate got, Silky got some, an’ mine,
an’ Little S…</p>
<p><strong>silky</strong>: It ain’t enough.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Not yet maybe.</p>
<p><strong>written words</strong>: Some months later, Hodgeman County,
Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>the kid’s voice</strong>: You don’t look like no rootin’,
tootin’, sonofabitchin’, cold-blooded assassin.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I seen how you got only three fingers on
your left hand, though, so I guess you’re calling yourself Mister Bill
Munny.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: William Munny, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake
County?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Paw! Hey, Paw!</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: What is it, son?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Two more hogs got the fever.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You shot Charlie Pepper, didn’t you? And
you’re the one killed William Harbey an’ robbed the train over…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Hold on, mister. Son, this here pig gotta be
moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother
a hand…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: This one’s sick too?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Let’s talk inside, mister.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You’re Pete Sothow’s nephew, huh? Hell, I
thought maybe you was someone come to kill me… …for somethin’ I done in
the old days.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I could of… easy.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Like I was sayin’ you don’t look like no
meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Maybe I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, Uncle Pete said you was the
goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an’ if I ever wanted a
partner for a killin’, you was the worst one. Meanin’ the best. On
account of you’re cold as snow an’ don’t have no weak nerve nor
fear.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: He said that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’m a damn killer myself, only I ain’t
killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call
me.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Schofield? You from Schofield?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: On account of my Schofield model Smith and
Wesson pistol.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, how about it?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Bein’ my partner. I’m headin’ North up
around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good
cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: For cuttin’ up a lady. They cut up her face
an’ cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an’ her tits too.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a
piece.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Paw, I can’t move that damn pig.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: No cussin’ now, Will. Go on out the pump an’
clean up some an’ I’ll be along. Check them other pens.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I ain’t like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done
it as much as anythin’ I guess. I ain’t touched a drop in ten years. My
wife, she cured me of it… cured me of drink an’ wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well… you don’t look so prosperous. Hell,
you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two
an’ you could buy your wife one of them fancy…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: She’s passed on, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Been gone near three years now.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Don’t tell nobody about the reward an’ all.
Don’t need no other gunmen tryin’ to collect.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I don’t never see nobody anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: If you was to change your mind, might be
you could catch me… due West to the Western Trail an’ North to
Ogallala.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Best we move that pig.</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Paw… two of them others… I think they got the
fever.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: You boys took a while. Couple more days I
was gonna call on the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: River was swole so we couldn’t cross her.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: You got two of mine. This here one ain’t
yours.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Damn you. That ain’t no way to behave. Quit
that.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: This here pony… I brung it for the lady… the
one my partner cut.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: It’s the best of the lot… better than the
ones I give him. She could sell it or… what she wants.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: A pony!… She ain’t got no face left an’
you’re gonna give her a goddamn mangy pony.</p>
<p><strong>davey</strong>: He ain’t m-m-mangy, ma’am, he…</p>
<p><strong>penny</strong>: Did Paw used to kill folks?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She ain’t hardly a saddle horse no more, Paw.
She ain’t used to the feel.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Them flowers, Penny, I could tell your Maw
liked them, hear? Take care of your sister, son. You can kill three
chickens if you need, not no more. Keep the hogs that got fever separate
if you can. An’ if you need help, go see Sally Two-Trees over to Ned
Logan’s.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Ain’t felt a saddle in a while myself.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Easy old gal, easy…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Now this here horse is gettin’ even on me…
hold on gal… for the sins of my youth… In my youth… before I met… your
dear departed mother… I was weak an’ givin’ to mistreatin’ horses an’
such. An’ this here horse… an’ that ole pig, too, I guess… is my
comeuppance for my cruelty…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Used to be I could cuss an’ hurt an animal…
til your departed mother, God rest her, showed me the error of my
ways.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I won’t be no longer than a couple of weeks.
Remember how the spirit of your departed maw watches over you.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Where’d you get the money, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We ain’t got it. We ain’t got no money.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: You told them cowboys you had it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We was… lyin’.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: What you gonna do when somebody comes to
collect? FUCK ’EM? FUCK ’EM A THOUSAND TIMES? The kind of people who’ll
come after that thousand, they won’t tolerate if you don’t have it. They
won’t just cut your face up a little. STUPID CUNTS!</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Oh, shit, shit an’ damn, oh fuck my
mother and my father, o damn an’ jesus.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Hit your finger, huh?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How
do you like her?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Heard you done the roof yourself.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically
every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: What’s all that wood?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Porch. I’m puttin’ a porch on her so’s
I can puff my pipe of an evening an’ drink my coffee an’ watch the sun
set.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You come clear up here just to get a
look at her?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Them whores…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Them whores, they been fuckin’ an’ fuckin’
all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons
an’ cattle barons, but you’ re gonna be the first of the billiard
barons.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: …They been fuckin’ ‘em, ’an tellin’ every
bow-legged one of ‘em how they’re payin’ a thousand dollars to whatever
sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: An’ all them cowboys been riding that
beef down to Kansas an’ Cheyenne?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: All week?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: I didn’t hear nothin’ till last night.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Word must have got all the way to Texas
by now.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody’s gonna come
clear from Texas.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: They really got all that money, them
whores?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: You know how women kin lie… I knock ’em
around a little, ask ’em where the money is, they say they don’t have
none?… but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of ’em.
Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: That much, huh?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: You could run off them two cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I could run off them whores.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Well, I guess they’ll just up an’ run
anyhow, them two.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Nope. They’ll stay out on the Spade
country where they got friends.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Shit, Bill, could be nobody won’t come at
all.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I’ll be damned. It’s Billy Munny.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Hullo Sally… I… uh, I ain’t seen you in near
as long as this, uh… as this horse ain’t felt the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Come on in outta the sun, Bill. Sally, you see
to Bill’s horse.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: We ain’t bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we’re
farmers.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Should be easy killin’ em… supposin’ they
don’t run off to Texas first.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine…
ten years?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Easy, huh? Hell, I don’t know that it was all
that easy then… an’ we was young an’ full of beans. Bill… if you was mad
at ‘em… if they done you wrong… I could see shootin’ ’em…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: We done stuff before for money, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, we thought we was doin’ it for money…
What’d they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich
fella?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her
tits off, cut her fingers off… done everythin’ but cut up her cunny, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, I guess they got it comin’… But you
wouldn’t go if Claudia was alive.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I guess you wouldn’t mind to look in on my
youngsters next week. Might be you could help them move a couple of them
pigs if they got to separate ’em more.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: How long you gonna be, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Two weeks, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: This Kid, what’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Three ways?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yeah, an’ I could still hit a bird in the eye
flyin’.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Jesus, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He musta been movin’ right along.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: We’ll come across him tomorra, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Got used to my bed. Ain’t gonna feel to home
out here.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, it ain’t just the bed I’m gonna miss.
I’m… Hell, Billy, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: It ain’t nothin’, don’t fret it. She don’t
like it much, you goin’ off with me.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Sally?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: She gave me the evil eye.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: It’s just… she’s a Indian an’ Indians ain’t…
overfriendly.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I ain’t blamin’ her, Ned, I ain’t holdin’ it
against her. She knew me back then… an’ she seen what a no good
sonofabitch I was… an’ she won’t allow how I’ve changed. She just don’t
know how I ain’t like that no more.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, she…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I ain’t the same, Ned. Claudia, she…
straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an’ all. Us goin’ to do
this killin’… that don’t mean I’m back to like I was. I just need the
money… for a new start… for them youngsters. Remember that drover, the
one I shot in the mouth so’s the teeth come out the back of his head? I
dream about him now an’ again. I didn’t have no reason to shoot him… not
one I could remember when I sobered up.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You was a… a crazy sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Nobody liked me… none of the boys. They was
scared of me… figured I might shoot ’em out of pure meanness.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You ain’t like that no more.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Eagle… he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn’t
like me none.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Nor Quincy, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Quincy, he was always watchin’ me.
Scared.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You ain’t like that no more.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Hell, no. I’m just a fella now. Ain’t no
different from anyone else no more.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hell, Bill, I always liked you… even back
then.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: No you didn’t. You wasn’t no different,
Ned.</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: All I want to know is what sonofabitch shot
him, that’s all. Was it one of them John Bull assholes?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: No, sir, I believe the would-be
murderer is a gentleman of French ancestry… or so it would seem. I hope
I won’t give offense if I observe that the French are known to be a race
of assassins, though they can’t shoot worth a damn… any Frenchman among
the present company excluded of course.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Says here a fellow by the name of “Gitto.”
“G-U-I–T…”</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: Sounds like a damn John Bull to me.
“Gitto.”</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Well, sirs… again not wishing to give
offense… it might be a good idea if the country were to choose a Queen…
or even a King… rather than a president. One isn’t as quick to take a
shot at a King or a Queen. The majesty of royalty, you see…</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: Maybe you don’t wish to give offense, sir,
but you are givin’ it pretty thick. This country don’t need no queens
whatsoever, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: As a matter of fact, what I heard about
Queens…</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Shut up, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: Huh? What’s got up your ass, Thirsty? This
dude asshole…</p>
<p><strong>thurston</strong>: Might be the “dude” is English Bob… the
one who works for the Union Pacific shootin’ Chinamen. Might be he wants
for some dumb cowboy to touch his pistol… so’s he can shoot him
down.</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: That a fact, mister? You English Bob?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Why don’t we shoot some turkeys,
friend? Ten shots… a dollar a turkey. I’ll shoot for the Queen, and you
can shoot for… whomever.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: I believe that’s eight for me… to one
for you. A matter of seven of your American dollars.</p>
<p><strong>crocker</strong>: Pretty damn good shootin’… for a John
Bull.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: No doubt your aim was affected by your
grief over the injury to your… uh… president.</p>
<p><strong>chandler</strong>: It’s a nickel up to Big Whiskey,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>germany joe</strong>: I godd nize horzes I zell you, boyce.
Nize prizes for Independence Day, boyce.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: It’s the climate does it. That and the
infernal distances.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Does what?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Induces people to shoot persons in high
places. It’s a savage country. That’s the second one shot in twenty
years. It’s uncivilized shooting people of substance.</p>
<p><strong>no firearms in big whiskey. ordinance 14. deposit
pistols</strong>: AND RIFLES COUNTY OFFICE.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Pardon me, gentlemen, but local ordinance
obliges you to surrender your sidearms to proper authority for the
duration of your visit.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Proper authority eh? Well, sir… neither
my companion nor I carry firearms on our persons. Rather, we trust in
the goodwill of our fellow man and the forbearance of reptiles.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Unarmed, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Christ, it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: If I’m gonna get shot, I druther it was hot
then cold. Everythin’ hurts more in the cold.</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: You know how if you hit your thumb in the
cold, how it…?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Shut up, Fatty.</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: I only said…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Clyde’s back.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Little Bill with him?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You boys clean my Remington?</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: Cleaned an’ loaded.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Where’s Little Bill for Christ sake?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ha. He was building his fucking porch.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Building his porch!</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: If you was to get shot, Andy, would you like
it better to be a hot day or…?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I ain’t gonna get shot.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: He’s coming ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: ’Course he’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: Hey, I just loaded her. Watcha doin?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I don’t trust nobody to load my guns, not for
a shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Little Bill? He didn’t say nothing. Like I
said, he was buildin’ his porch. Have you seen that thing?</p>
<p><strong>fatty</strong>: It was all loaded. Jesus, Clyde, you got
three pistols an’ only one arm for Christ sake.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I just don’t wanna get killed for lack of
shootin’ back. You know there ain’t a straight angle in that whole
goddamn porch… or in the whole house for that matter. He’s the worst
fucking carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: He didn’t say nothin’, huh?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Asked what they looked like, that’s all.
Christ, maybe he’s tough but he sure ain’t no carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Maybe he ain’t so tough.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He seem like… like he was… scared?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Little Bill? Him scared?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: We never seen him up against any… like
these ones… killers.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Little Bill come out of Kansas an’ Texas,
boys. He worked them tough towns.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: No. He wasn’t scared, boys. He just ain’t a
good carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: …can see that there’s a dignity in
royalty… a majesty… that precludes the likelihood of assassination.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Why, if you were to point a pistol at a
King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though
palsied…</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: I wouldn’t point no pistol at nobody,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: A wise policy. But if you did, I can
assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts
of bloodshed and stand… in awe. Whereas, a president… I mean, why not
shoot a president?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell
me again.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Down the street and across. Greely’s Beer
Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game
of billiards.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Billiards, eh? Even though I don’t
really wish to play?</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Don’t matter. They burned the table in ’78
for firewood.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Ah, I see.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Come on, WW. Let’s…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Shit and fried eggs.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Been a long time, Bob. You run out of
Chinamen?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I
see you shaved off your chin whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well, I was always tasting the soup two
hours after I et it.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: What I heard was that you fell off your
horse drunk and broke your neck.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I
even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.
Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: WW Beauchamp… Little Bill Daggett and…
“friends.”</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: From N-n-newton?… and H-hays and Aa-Abilene?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You work for the railroads too, Mister
Beauchamp?</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write… I wr- wrwrite…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Letters?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Books. He’s my biographer.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: I wouldn’t do it, WW.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: It’s only a b-b-b-book…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: A book, huh? I guess that means you can
read… An’ I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your
firearms… But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain’t armed, are
you, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Not really… Maybe a couple of
Peacemakers… I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn’t
see them… or hear them?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I guess not, Bob. I don’t like guns
around.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Charley, see what kind of “books”
Mister Beauchamp is packing… but watch you don’t get wet.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Be careful with those, sonny.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: No shit, Little Bill, all he’s got is this
here book.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: The… Duck of Death.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Give me the .32, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: You leave me at the mercy of my
enemies.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Enemies, Bob? You been talking about
the Queen again? On Independence Day?</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Wh… what…?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I guess you think I’m kickin’ you, Bob…
but it ain’t so. What I’m doin’ is talkin’, hear? I’m talkin’ to all
them villains down in Kansas an’ them villains in Cheyenne… Lettin’ em
know there ain’t no whores’ gold…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: …an’ how if there was… how they
wouldn’t want to come lookin’ for it anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Say, Bill… You ever… ever go into town… an’
all?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: No. I mean… …an’ get yourself a woman? You
know?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Naw. Naw, I don’t ever go into town for that.
A man like me… A man like me can’t get no woman but one he’s gonna pay
for… an’ that ain’t right… buyin’ flesh. Claudia, God rest her soul, she
wouldn’t have wanted me doin’ nothin’ like that, me bein’ a father, an’
all.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Whaddaya do, just use your hand?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Sometimes… yeah. I don’t miss it all that
much.</p>
<p><strong>ned’s voice</strong>: Billy. Billy.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Some fucker’s shootin’ at us.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He hit you?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Naw. I bumped my head fallin’ off of my
horse.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He ain’t shootin’ our way no more. He’s
shootin’ over that way. Who’s he shootin’ at over that way?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Beats the hell out of me.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You suppose maybe we’re in somebody’s
field?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I didn’t see nothin’ planted.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Fuck, he’s shootin’ at us again.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Jesus, he’s shootin’ up the whole fucking
horizon.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: HEY.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You’re marking us, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: HEY, KID.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Kid? The Kid’s shootin at us?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: IS THAT YOU, KID?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Why would the Kid shoot at us?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: HEY KID, IT’S ME, BILL MUNNY.</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: Hey, Kid, is that you? It’s me, Bill
Munny.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: YEAH. IT’S ME.</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: Don’t shoot at us no more, okay?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: WHO YOU GOT WITH YOU?</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: Ned Logan. My old partner, Ned Logan.
Don’t you shoot no more, okay?</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: We’re gonna collect our horses an’
come on over. You ain’t gonna shoot no more, are you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: NO, I AIN’T.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Had to chase the damn horse a mile.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: What was you shootin’ at us for, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Thought you was followin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my
mind an’…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Wasn’t nothin’ said about no partner.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, this here’s Ned Logan… Ned, this here’s
the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an’…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I seen two fellas followin’ me, I guessed
they come to kill me. We didn’t talk about no other fella.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, now Kid, there’s two of these cowboys,
ain’t that so? Better there’s three of us… maybe them cowboys got
friends. Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I was gonna kill them two by myself. It
don’t take three.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Now Ned’s a hell of a shot with a rifle.
Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin’.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Better’n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn’t comin’
close.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Keep your damn hands offa that rifle,
Mister.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I was only checkin’ it for you. Thought maybe
somethin’ was bent.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Nothin’s bent.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, you was shootin’ every which way an’…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You gonna share your half with him?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Three ways, I figured.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya,
Kid!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You’re goin’ back with him?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: He’s my partner. He don’t go, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What’s it come to, three ways?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What the hell are you pissin’ about, I’d
like to know?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, what were you lookin’ at anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Lookin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Clouds, Kid. We was lookin’ at them clouds on
account of we got a storm ridin’ up our ass.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Oh, them. Hell, I seen them.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You was right to change your mind, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I’m a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I
could kill that hawk with one shot.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Hell, I could hit it too if I didn’t mind
wasting a shot.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: There ain’t no hawk up there, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Can’t see worth a shit, can you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: See them fucking turtles?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: How far kin you see?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Far enough.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: We ain’t goin’ to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A
hundred yards?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: See that scrub oak yonder?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He’s blind, for Chri…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I ain’t blind, you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin
see fifty yards, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an’ I
kin shoot this sonofabitch…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The
Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Fifty yards ain’t bad. Guess we better get
along.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Them boys look like real hard cases.
Did you kill all seven of ’em dead, Bob… or did you just wing some of
’em?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: That is you there, ain’t it, Bob? The
Duck of Death?</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Uh… Duke.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Oh yeah… Duke. Well, Bob, you always
was hell an’ Jesus with a pistol… but seven of ‘em, an’ you protectin’
the lady too… How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Uh… It’s… uh… generally considered desirable in
the publishing business to… ah… take certain license in depicting the
cover scene… for… ah… purposes involving the… ah, market place.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well, Mister Beauchamp… from what I
read of this here book, I’d have to say the writin’ ain’t a whole lot
different from the pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Uh… I can assure you, Mister Daggett… the events
described within are based… on the accounts of eye witnesses and…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Meaning the duck himself, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Duke.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Duck, I says. “You have insulted the
honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran,” said the duck. “You must
apologize.” But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he
reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was
faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns.”</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: I believe that to be an accurate description of
the events, sir… albeit there is a certain poetry to the language
which…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the
Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky
Corcoran… an’ I didn’t see you there… nor no woman, nor no twogun
shooters nor nothin’ like that.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: You were there?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: First off… Corky didn’t carry two
pistols, though he should of.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: But he was called…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Some folks did call Old Corky “Two Gun”
but not because he was sportin’ two pistols but because he had a dick so
big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An’
the only insultin’ he done was stickin’ that big dick of his in some
French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on… Well, one day Corky walked into
the Blue Bottle and before he knows what’s happening Bob takes a shot at
him… and misses on account of he’s drunker than hell.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well, that bullet whizzin’ by panicked
Corky, an’ he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry
he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off
another… but he’s so drunk he misses again an’ hits the thousand dollar
mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead
‘cause this time Corky does right an’ aims real good, no hurry…</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his
hand… which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have
really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended
himself to the end.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: You… you mean… English Bob killed him
while…?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well he wasn’t gonna wait for Corky to
grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein’ drunk, an’ shot him
through the liver.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: No sir, I did not give up robbin’ an’ stealin’
on account of I got religion. I give it up ’cause I got too old for all
this here nature.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I give it up ‘cause I hate sleepin’ out in the
air… fuckin’ sticks in my food… an’ fuckin’ bugs in my food… an’ fuckin’
rocks under my back… Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin’ bed.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah… you said that last night.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Last night I said I missed my fuckin’ wife…
tonight I just miss my fuckin’ bed.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, I guess you’re gonna miss your fuckin’
roof soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County…
did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: An’ how there was two deputies up close
pointin’ rifles at you… had you dead to rights… an’ how you pulled out a
pistol an’ blew them both away to hell… an’ only took a scratch
yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin’ like it, shootin’
your way out of a scrape like that.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well… I don’t recollect.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You don’t recollect!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Say, Ned… ?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: How many men you killed? Ain’t you gonna
answer?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I don’t like the question.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I’m
ridin’ with, don’t I? In case of a scrape.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: How many you killed, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Five. I killed five of ’em. That counts a
Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Get some sleep, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You boys are crotchety as a couple of
hens.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Aw shit!</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Actually, then, Mister Corcoran was faster on
the draw than the D… English Bob?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Faster? Fast was his mistake. If he
hadn’t of been in such a goddamn hurry he would not have shot off his
toe with his first shot and he would have killed old Bob. See, son,
bein’ a good shot an’ bein’ quick with a pistol… that don’t do no harm…
but it ain’t much next to bein’ cool.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: A man who will keep his head an’ not
get rattled under fire… he will kill you like as not.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: But if the other fellow is quicker and fires
first…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: He will be hurryin’ and he will miss.
That there is as fast as I can pull an’ aim an’ hit anythin’ more’n ten
feet away… unless it’s a barn.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: But… if he doesn’t miss?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Then he will kill you. That is why
there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there… an’ like me. It ain’t
so easy to shoot a man anyhow… an’ if the sonofabitch is shootin’ back
at you… well, it’ll unnerve most fellas. Look here, let me show you
somethin’. See this here pistol?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Take it. Go on, take a hold.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Them’s the keys. All you gotta do is
shoot me an’ you an’ English Bob can ride out free as birds.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Is… is it… loaded?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Wouldn’t be no good if it wasn’t. You
got to cock it though.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: An’ you got to point it. Go on, point
it.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: All you gotta do is pull on the
trigger, mister.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Hot, ain’t it? You never even put your
finger on the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: What if… what if I gave it to… him.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Go ahead… give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant…?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Guess he don’t want it, Mister
Beauchamp.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You was right not to take it, Bob. I
would of killed you.</p>
<p><strong>little bill’s voice</strong>: We could use some rain, eh,
Mister Beauchamp?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You fucking no-good goddamn shitfaced pig
fucking dirty whore.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I didn’t mean it, old gal.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I brung this for when we had to kill them
fellows. I guess we could use some now.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Not for me. I don’t touch it no more.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: God damn it, Bill, it’s rainin’.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I know it’s rainin’, Give the Kid a drink,
why dontcha?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You think the Kid really killed five men?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: What he was talkin’ about… how them deputies
had the drop on you an’ Pete…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I remember how there was three of them deputies
you shot… not two.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, I ain’t like that no more, Ned. I ain’t
no crazy, killin’ fool.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You still think it’ll be easy shootin’ them
cowboys?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: If we don’t drown first.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Give them keys to the conductor and
tell him he can loose the cuffs off of Bob soon as he’s out of the
county.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: Mmmm pistols.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I guess you know, Bob, how if I see you
again I’ll just start shootin’ right off an’ figure it’s self
defense.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I ain’t stealin’ your biographer, Bob.
Stayin’ on was his idea.</p>
<p><strong>english bob</strong>: A plague on you! A plague on the whole
stinking lot of you! You’re uncivilized vermin, without laws or morals!
You’re worthless savages! I curse you! You’re cursed! Cursed!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nobody’s gonna come.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: After what Little Bill done to the
Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Delilah, them tables ain’t clean. Can’t you
get ’em clean?</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Well, if you’d cover up your face, maybe
somebody’d want to fuck with you an’ you wouldn’t have to do all the
cleanin’. Whaddaya call them things that cover the face?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: A veil.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Yeah, a veil. Christ it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Rain’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You sure, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I left you some… about a drop.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You alright, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: A fella’s askin’ for you, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Tonight? You ain’t joshin’?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: This way, mister.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Must be randy as hell to come out in this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: “No,” he says, “you are wrong Little
Bill. That there is no Curly J but a bobbed J.” He had worked it over,
you see?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: “Jim,” I says, “You are a liar and a
horse thief.” Now – when he seen them others wasn’t gonna help him none
– he started in to cryin’ and sobbin’ and sayin’… “Don’t kill me, Little
Bill, don’t kill me, please don’t kill me.”</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: “Well, Jim,” I says, “it makes me sick
to see a man struttin’ around and packin’ two pistols an’ a Henry rifle
and cryin’ like a baby.”</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Did you… kill him?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: No,… but I can’t abide them kind… an’
you will find a lot of them in the saloons… tramps an’ drunk teamsters
an’ crazy miners… sportin’ pistols like they was bad men, but not having
no sand nor character… not even bad character.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I do not like assassins an’ men of low
character like your friend English Bob… but Bob ain’t no coward who will
cry to your face an’ then…</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Uh… Sheriff… Uh…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I
guess I’m clean out of receptacles.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Maybe you should… hang the carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: Uh… hang the… uh… carpenter. I…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: On a night like this? What the
hell?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Three seedy lookin’ fellas come inta town,
Bill. They’re down to Greely’s an’ at least two of ’em got guns.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: …in hell’s takin’ The Kid so long? You suppose

<p><strong>munny</strong>: You… you remember Eagle Hendershot?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Huh? Uh… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I seen him.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He’s dead, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: His head was all busted open so’s you could
see the inside.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Worms was comin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Listen, Bill, I’m gonna see what’s takin’ The
Kid so long. Must be he’s gettin’ an advance offa them sportin’
ladies.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Say, Bill… If I was to… take a little while
myself… I guess you… I guess you… I guess you don’t want to come?</p>
<p><strong>little bill’s voice</strong>: …me your pistol, mister.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I says, “You’ll want to give over your
pistol.”</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Uh, no. No, I ain’t drunk.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Ordinance says you got to turn in your
firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn’t read it
with the weather an’ all.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well… uh… I… I ain’t got no, uh,
firearms.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Them friends of yours in the back, they
carryin’ pistols?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I… dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain’t
carryin’ no guns.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You’re spillin’ your whiskey,
mister.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Like I said, I…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Uh, William… uh… Hendershot.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to
call you a no good sonofabitch an’ a liar, an’ if I was to say you shit
in your pants on account of a cowardly soul… well, I guess then, you
would show me your pistol right quick an’ shoot me dead, ain’t that
so?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I… I guess I might… but like I said, I ain’t
armed.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I guess you just carry it for snakes
an’ such.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Uh… yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: There ain’t no snakes in here, Mister
Hendershot.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, uh… it ain’t loaded.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, the powder’s wet an…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Mister Beauchamp, this here is the sort
of trash I was speakin’ of.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: You will find these kind in the saloons
of your prosperous communities. But you will not find none of them in
Big Whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hurry. You know what to say to Little
Bill?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You got to look sharp for that old oak. You
miss the oak an’ you ain’t gonna find it.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Never mind your shirt, get them boots on.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The roof ain’t much but…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What about Bill? What we gonna do
about…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Come on, Kid. I hope them horses is still
there.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Let the man out, WW. He is desiring to
leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: Easy, Little Bill, she’s gotta work, she’s
gotta turn a dollar a time.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: If they was just here for the fuckin’,
how come they lit out the back window?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: On account of they seen you was beatin’ on
their friend.</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Th-th-they just c-c-come for the b-
bbilliards, Little Bill, honest.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Billiards! An’ they was just passin’
through?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Th-th-they was g-g-goin to F-f-fort
B-b-buford t-t-to…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You just kicked the shit out of a innocent
man, you big asshole.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Innocent of what?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Hold him, dammit.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Jesus. You done this before?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Plenty of times.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: His pistol must of jammed.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Move the candle closer, I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He wouldn’t of took no beating like that if
it hadn’t of jammed. He wouldn’t just give it over an’ not shoot no
one.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He didn’t even pull his pistol, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: He ain’t as tough as you, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my
pistol an…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol… right outta
the lady an’ out the back window.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: That was your idea, I wanted to…</p>
<p><strong>silky</strong>: We gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Huh? Already? Hey, I’m near ready for
another advance.</p>
<p><strong>silky</strong>: You’re gonna use it all up before you get
it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No more advances on what you ain’t done
yet.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, we’re just waitin’ on the weather. If
the weather breaks tomorrow we could…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: We’re gonna need more food… at least three days
worth…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Three days? We could kill ’em tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I don’t kill nobody without him.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: We don’t need him. The two of us could do
it.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He ain’t nothin’ but a broken down pig
farmer.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: One of us’ll bring food in the morning. I
guess you’ll want some whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: An’ medicine if you got it…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Ohhhhh, ooohhhh no. No, I didn’t do
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Don’t it make you sick, hearin’ him like
that? Don’t you ladies worry none…Me an’ Ned, we’ll kill those two
fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: It was a lot of shit what my uncle told me,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Depends what he told you. About Bill, you
mean?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: All of it. About him, an’ you an’ Uncle
Pete… about robbin’ the Rock Island Pacific… an’ about them Missouri
Banks.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: We done that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well I guess Bill Munny wasn’t no fearless
killer an’ bank robber like he said.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Kid, it ain’t gonna mean nothin’ to you, but
the roof I built on my house, it don’t have a leak in it… not one. Most
folks think a school house is the first sign of civilizin’… but I say
it’s a good roof.</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: Claudia… No… Oh, Jesus, Claudia,
ohh…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Claudia… ain’t here, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Ned… Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen…
death.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Easy, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I seen the angel of death Ned, an’ I seen the
river. He’s a snake, he got… snake eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: The angel… the angel of death. I’m scared,
Ned. Ned, I’m gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Easy, Bill, easy.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I seen her… I seen Claudia too…</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Well, that’s good now, ain’t it, Bill? Seein’
Claudia an…?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I’m
scared of dyin’…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Ned… don’t tell nobody… don’t tell the kids…
don’t tell ’em none of… none of the things I done.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He’s gonna die, ain’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, suppose he does?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: We’ll bury him.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: That ain’t what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: You mean, am I gonna help you kill them
cowboys?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I can’t spot ’em myself but you could. That
red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: An’ if I spot ’em?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’ll ride up close an’ shoot ’em!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I told you I’m a damn killer. I done it
before. I’m more killer than him.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Hell, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I thought… you was an angel.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: You ain’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess
I must look a lot like you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: You don’t look nothin’ like me, mister.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I didn’t mean no offense. I guess you’re the
one them cowboys cut up. Ned an’ The Kid, my partners, are they… ?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: They went out scouting when they saw your
fever broke.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Scouting?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: On the Bar T… looking for… them.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Oh. How long I been here?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Three days. Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Three days? I must be.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most
times I wouldn’t even notice them birds much. But I’m noticin’ ’em real
good ’cause I thought I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: I brought your hat. You… left it down at
Greely’s.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: That big guy lookin’ for me?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Little Bill? He thinks you went North.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Are you really going to kill them?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah, I guess. There’s still a payment, ain’t
there?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Them other two, they been takin’ advances
on the payment.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Advances?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Free ones.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Free ones?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Alice an’ Silky gave them… free ones.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: You want… a free one.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Me? No. No, I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: I didn’t mean… with me. Alice and Silky,
they’ll give you one… if you want.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I… I guess not. I didn’t mean I didn’t want
one ‘cause of you bein’ cut up. I didn’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: It ain’t that at all. You’re a beautiful
woman. What I said before, how I might look like you… I didn’t mean you
was ugly like me, hell no… I only meant how we both had scars.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You’re a beautiful woman an’… if I was to
want a free one, I guess I’d want you more than them others. It ain’t…
See… I can’t have no free one on account of my wife…</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: Your wife?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah. See?</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: I admire that, you being true to your wife.
I’ve seen a lot of… of men… who weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: She back in Kansas?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Uh… yeah. Yeah. She’s uh… watchin’ over the
little ones.</p>

<p><strong>munny</strong>: Finish him, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: He ain’t dead? You didn’t get him?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: He got the boy’s horse.</p>
<p><strong>munny’s voice</strong>: Better get him ’fore he gets clear of

<p><strong>the kid</strong>: What rocks? Why don’t you shoot? What’s
goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>johnny’s voice</strong>: Fuckin’ bushwhackin’ assholes.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Ain’t you gonna shoot? Is he dead?</p>

<p><strong>munny</strong>: Just SHOOT!</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Where are you, Bill, where are you, I can’t

<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Is that what it was like, Bill, in the old
days… ridin’ out with everybody shootin’… smoke all over an’ folks
yellin’ an’ bullets whizzin’ by?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Shit… I thought they was gonna get us. I
was even… scared a little… just for a minute. Was you ever scared in
them days?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I don’t remember, Kid. I was drunk most of
the time. Give me a pull on that bottle, will you?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I shot that fucker three times. He was
takin’ a shit. He went for his pistol an’ I blazed away… first shot got
him in the chest…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Say, Bill…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: That was… the first one.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: First one what?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: First one I ever killed.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: How I said I shot five men… it wasn’t true.
That Mexican… the one that come at me with a knife… I busted his leg
with a shovel… I didn’t shoot him or nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, that fella today, you shot him
alright.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him…
three shots… he was takin’ a sh-sh-shit an’… an’…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Take a drink, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Oh Ch-ch-christ… it don’t… it don’t seem…
real… How he’s… DEAD… how he ain’t gonna breathe no more… n-n-never. Or
the other one neither… On account of… of just… pullin’ a trigger.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: It’s a hell of a thing, ain’t it, killin’ a
man. You take everythin’ he’s got… an’ everythin’ he’s ever gonna
have…</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Well, I gu-guess they had it… comin’.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: We all got it comin’, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I was watchin’ you… seein’ if you was
followed.</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Silky an’ Faith, they rode off to the
East an’ two deputies was followin’ them.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You wanna help me count, Kid?</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I trust you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Well, you don’t wanna trust me too much.
We’ll take Ned his share together so you don’t figure I run off with
it.</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Ned’s share?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess
we’ll catch him before…</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: He’s… he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: No he ain’t. He went South yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: They… they killed him. I… thought you
know that. I thought you knew because…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Nobody didn’t kill Ned, he went South
yesterday. He didn’t even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Who killed him?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Little Bill. The… the Bar T boys caught
him and Little Bill…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: He hanged him? Shot him down?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: N-no. He… he beat him up. He was making
him… answer questions… and beating him up… and then… Ned just died.
Little Bill didn’t mean to kill him… he said he was sorry an’ all… but
he said it was a good example anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Good example! Good example of what I’d like
to know? He didn’t even kill nobody… he couldn’t do it no more.</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: They got… a sign on him says he was a
killer.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: A sign on him?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: In front of Greely’s. It says, “This
here is what happens to…”</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: They got a sign on him in front of
Greely’s?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: The questions Little Bill asked him… what
sort of questions was they?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: About where you an’ him was… an’ where
you was from… an’ what your names was… an’…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: What’d Ned say?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: L-lies… at first. About how you was just
passin’ through and didn’t kill nobody… an’ Little Bill kept askin’
questions, mixin’ him up, catchin’ lies… an’ then he’d beat on Ned an’
Ned would cry and lie some more an’ then… then…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Then… what?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: A cowboy come in sayin’ you killed Quick
Mike in the shit house at the Bar T…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: An’ Little Bill killed Ned for what I
done?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: Not on purpose. But he started hurtin’
him worse… makin’ him tell stuff. First ned wouldn’t say nothin’… but
Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was…</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: He said how you was really Three
Fingered Jack out of Missouri… an’ Bill said “Same Three Fingered Jack
that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in ‘69 killin’ women and
children an’ all?” An’ Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you
was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James
Brothers an’ how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an’ kill him
like you killed a U.S. Marshall in ’73.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Didn’t scare Little Bill though, did it?</p>
<p><strong>little sue</strong>: N-no, sir?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Wha… what f-for?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Lemmee see it.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Sure. Sure, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You… you could keep it, Bill. I ain’t…
gonna use it no more, I ain’t gonna kill nobody.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I… I ain’t like you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You… gonna take… the money?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You better get on back, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You could have it. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an’
fancy clothes an’ all.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: I’d rather be blind and ragged than dead, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Shit, Kid. I ain’t gonna kill you. You’re…
the only friend I got.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: This here money, take my share an’ Ned’s an’
leave it with my youngsters. Tell ’em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I
ain’t back in a week. The rest is yours… you could buy them
spectacles.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: Are you… Are you gonna… kill Little
Bill?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I guess you won’t mind my keepin’ the
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: You’re gonna kill him, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Stay clear of folks you might see. There’s
plenty out lookin’ to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Alright, I’m gonna say just one more
time so it’s all clear an’ then don’t ask me no more.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Now each of you that posse’d today has
got one drink comin’ off the county budget…</p>
<p><strong>thirsty</strong>: Yahoo.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: …an’ whoever rode yesterday, gets one
drink for that…</p>
<p><strong>paddy</strong>: Yippee.</p>
<p><strong>eggs</strong>: I told yuh two, I…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Hold it hold it. After them two, it’s
outta your own pocket… hear me, Skinny? …an’ we’re pullin’ out early
tomorrow an’ chase these fellas clear to Texas so I wouldn’t spend much
of your own money.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Now if we divide up into four parties
an’ hit all the farms an’ trails in a circle, we’re bound to find some
one who seen them skunks an’…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Which fucker owns this shithole?</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: You there, fat man, speak up.</p>
<p><strong>skinny</strong>: I… I own this establishment. I bought it
from Greely for a thous…</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Better step clear, boys.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Hold on, mist…</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Well sir… You are a cowardly
sonofabitch because you have just shot down an unarmed man.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: He should have armed himself if he was gonna
decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out
of Missouri, killer of women and children.</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: I have done that… killed women and children…
I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an’ now I have come
to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned. Now step aside.
boys.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: He’s got one barrel left, gentlemen.
After he has used it, pull your pistols and shoot him down like the
cowardly, drunken scoundrel he is.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Misfire! Kill the sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>munny</strong>: Every asshole that doesn’t want to get shot
best clear out the back quick.</p>
<p><strong>ww</strong>: I… I… think I’m… shot.</p>
