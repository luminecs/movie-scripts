<p><strong>trainer</strong>: Coax… a… smile… from… the child. Remember,
parents don’t want photos where their child isn’t smiling. Some children
may not want to smile. It is your job to coax a smile out of them. A
good line to remember is: “Santa thinks everybody should be happy. Can
you smile for Santa?” A camera can only copy a child’s smile – it will
take you to put it there.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: If the child will not smile, the Photo Elf
will go ahead and take the picture anyway. Now, it is a good Santa’s job
to smile as well – I know with the big white beard your smile will be
partially hidden, so you must learn to smile with your eyes. They show
warmth and can be very expressive.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: Remember you have been chosen for the
starring role of Santa Claus. Your portrayal of this beloved character
will have a major impact on every child you meet. Keep in mind at all
times that to them, you aren’t a man dressed up like Santa, you are
Santa.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Hurry boys, we’re gonna miss Santa! She
drags them across the street toward the looming art-deco monolith that
is the big-city department store.</p>
<p><strong>older child</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Attention shoppers: the store will be
closing in five minutes. We hope tomorrow is a pleasant Christmas and
thank you for shopping with us, your friends.</p>
<p><strong>photo elf</strong>: My, what a darling picture! Are you
certain you only want the single? Additional photos come in handy as
gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for
friends.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s all right, I’ll just take the
single.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Uh-huh… yeah… done.</p>
<p><strong>bratty kid</strong>: I saw you in another mall.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Right… Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>bratty kid</strong>: You’re not really Santa. If you were
Santa you could do magic.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: You want magic?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: There, I just made you disappear.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: …That it?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: …Thank fuckin’ Christ.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Merry Christmas, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Have it your way, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Don’t tell me which way to have it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m finished when I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’m goin’ downstairs… I need a melon-bailer
and a loofah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fuck the loofah, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Marcus, did you get the loofah?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah baby!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I got messages. Go wash yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: I’m a dancer, I sweat.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well you smell like a bum’s nutsack.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Soke, this is Andrew Kaplan again from
the collection agency – BOOP!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Willie, I don’t care man, I’m not
looking to blame anyone, but that diamond isn’t a real stone, man. I
took it to – BOOP!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Uh, hello, this is Helen Axelrod –
you ran into my car last week? Well I called State Farm but they have no
record of any insurance policy for you and – BOOP!</p>
<p><strong>marcus’ voice</strong>: Willie, it’s Marcus. It’s that time
of year again. Pack your shit. Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Jesus Christ! Can you maybe keep it together
for just ten minutes?!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: For crying out loud, chew a few of these…
you drunken, fuckin’ imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Harrison, please I Just let me explain.
Financially, the –</p>
<p><strong>harrison</strong>: You get what you pay for, Chipeska! Five
Christmases I’ve given my heart – my soul – my love to these kids, and
now what? Now you flip me for some stranger who’ll do it for peanuts and
happens to work with a real midget! Lemme tell you something: nobody
cares! Nobody comes here for the elf, Santa’s the attraction! I do Burl
Ives songs; does this schmoe even play guitar?</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Harrison, it’s not the money or the
midget. Believe me, if it was, I – I don’t think they like “midget”. I
think you’re supposed to call them –</p>
<p><strong>harrison</strong>: Aw, forget it!</p>
<p><strong>harrison</strong>: …Hacks!</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Hi. Bob Chipeska. I, please, I, uh –
please don’t listen to him. Great resume and photo by the way.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thanks… you know, we been at this a long
time an’ all, so we like to think we do a good job…</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: You two are the best men for the job.
Truly. So do not let his… unpleasantness affect your performance in any
way.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh no, we’re fine, w –</p>

<p><strong>willie</strong>: You know… fuck stick.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: OKAY! We’re gonna head upstairs now.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Such a card.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: He’s not gonna say “fuck stick” in front
of the children, is he?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No, no, no. Joke. Adult joke. For us.
Adults.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …Joke.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Merry Christmas! Santa’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What the fuck you doing, “fuck stick” in
front of the boss?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t like that guy.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You don’t like any guy. You think I can’t
find another portly motherfuck can run a water drill?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Don’t tempt my hand. You blow this and we’re
broke for the year. So stop acting like you know something because, pal
of mine, you don’t know squat. You’re gum on my shoe.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Now put on your fuckin’ hat and get out

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …You can tell me…</p>

<p><strong>willie</strong>: It was real. The hair fell out when I got
sick.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: How’d you get sick?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I loved a woman who wasn’t clean.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Mrs. Santa?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, her sister. Let the fucking thing
go.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What’s it like at the North Pole?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Like the suburbs.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Apache Junction. What the fuck do you

<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get the hell off my lap.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You are really Santa, right?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No. No, I’m an accountant. I wear this as a

<p><strong>kid</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get that kid out of here, he’s freaking me

<p><strong>willie</strong>: You tryin’ to say something to me?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah. I’m gonna stick my whole fist up your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: Listen here buddy, let me make
yourself perfectly clear. We don’t like your kind coming around here in
your red silk and satin clothes with your hunger for same-sex
relationships. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well fu-uck you!</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: I know that’s what you’d like to
do!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Up yours, yufff –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: Oh saved by a woman, mister No-Pussy-
Please man!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He ain’t worth it, sugar. He got hit on last
week. Didn’t sit too well.</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: …This is not Flagstaff!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Another Grandad, Santa?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Got a name?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What do you do? I mean, after the holidays?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nothing ’til March. Then I’m the Easter
Bunny.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: …Another?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why not. Buy you one?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Why not.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: …Not a big talker.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Buy you one?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why not.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You’re pretty regular, for a Santa.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s my job, no big deal. I’m an eating,
drinking, shitting, fucking Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Which?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yes! Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: At least lemme take off the hat!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I got a thing for Santa Claus, I don’t know, I
guess it’s from early childhood.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, so’s my thing for tits.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Maybe because my parents were Jewish and never
celebrated Christmas. Santa was sort of forbidden, you know?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I like you. Most of the people around here are
pretty uptight. My name is Sue. Here’s my number.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: …Don’t mothball that suit!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Whoa-Jesus! All right buddy, that’s it…</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: Buddy? I said, I am not gay!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look, what’s the problem pal, you go off
your meds?</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: …Yes, but this isn’t about that! You
are queer as a ten dollar bill.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now you listen. My brother lost an arm
fighting you people in Vietnam, so I want you to take a good hard look
at this face…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …‘cause it’s the last fuckin’ thing you’re
gonna see before I knock your head off and sh –</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: Who is the bitch now, fat man?!</p>
<p><strong>piping voice</strong>: Leave Santa alone!</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: Please little boy, I am doing this for
all of us!</p>
<p><strong>troublemaker</strong>: I think he has finished his cruising
for tonight, hm?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This one time I take you home.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m not your fuckin’ dada.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s not as if you helped out with that
nut-job.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And you’re right there to grab his fuckin’
balls.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Right height.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Twist ’em.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Why do you need a car?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Fuck you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: This car.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Whuh. Which turn is it?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Sage Terrace. Where’s your sleigh?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Repairs. In the shop.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Where’re the reindeer?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I stable ’em. Is it gonna be left or
right?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That way. Where’s the stable?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Next to the shop.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: How do they sleep?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who – the reindeer? Standing up.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: But the noise, how do they sleep?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What noise?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: From the shop.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They, uh, they only work during the day.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I thought it was always night at the North
Pole.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Not now. Now it’s always day.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Then how do they sleep?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, they – WILL YOU PUH-LEEEZ</p>
<p><strong>shut the fuck up! how the fuck do</strong>: KNOW?! I’M GONNA
– Whoa! Sage Terrace!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …What is it with you? Somebody drop you on
your fucking head?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: On my head?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What, are they gonna drop you on somebody
else’s head?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: How can they drop me onto my own head?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Not onto your own h – ARE YOU FUCKING</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nice digs. Daddy home?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He’s on a adventure ’sploring mountains. He
been gone a long time.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Exploring mountains? When’s he coming
back?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Next year.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What about Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: She lives in God’s house with Jesus and Mary
and the Ghost and the long- eared donkey and Joseph and the talking
walnut.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who the fuck takes care of you then?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Granma.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Really… What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Granma.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Uh-huh. Is Granny spry?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Granma, Santa’s here. Are you spry?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Roger! You’re home. Let me fix you some
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So you’re tellin’ me no one else is
here?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …No aunts, no uncles, no cousins?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Butler, security guard? Nothin’?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nuh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Daddy got a safe?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You need money to fix your sleigh?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You want milk and cookies?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Daddy got a car?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Bye Santa!</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning
down. The inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow – about six or
seven seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: “Fuck stick”?</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Yes, I thought it was strange too, but you
know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his little friend promised he wouldn’t say it
in front of the children. Which is fine because, you know, urn, there’s
an adult world and a child’s world and that’s okay. I’m not a
censor.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Little friend?</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget… a, a, I
don’t know what he’s called exactly but… a little guy. Little. Billy
Barty. God rest. But thin fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: “Little people,” that’s what they like.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Ah, yes, right.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: So “fuck stick,” that’s all?</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Well, no, there was something else…</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: …A couple of days ago I was in Women’s Big
&amp; Tall? –</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: and I heard these, urn, you know, these…
noises.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Oh yeah! Oh yeah!</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Yeah! Yeah! You ain’t gonna shit
right for a week!</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Now don’t get me wrong. I was against the
Clinton impeachment. What a man does with his penis – Oval Office,
Women’s Big &amp; Tall – it’s not for the American people to say.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: But when you’re dealing with children, a
tender sensibility, a position of trust – then perhaps, someone who has
screaming orgasms with large women –</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Though I can’t fire him for that.</p>

<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Help you with anything, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Just looking.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fuck me? Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You can’t just take up with some kid! You
don’t know who’s around, what they do!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You got some nerve you little shit ya. You

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You said that last night you stupid

piece of maggot-eaten shit that has ever slid from God’s gilded ass!
What if the kid has one of those fucking play-dates they have now?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You shittin’ me?! He doesn’t have fucking
friends! Not even an imaginary one! Unless he got ditched by him! He’s

Freud? The shrunken fuckin’ shrink?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, shit-for-brains, talk

<p><strong>gin</strong>: Your name Roger Merman?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Doing three-to-six for embezzlement?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: …Many accounting questions are not
cut-and-dried –</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You live at 41 Sage Terrace?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Is it Granma? Is my son alright?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: They’re fine. Do you have any house guests?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: …House guests?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Thanks much for your time. God bless.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: …Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well, it’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: …Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Yeah. Fucked. Frankly.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: He’s…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Clean.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: As a fuckin’ whistle.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: No. Nothing. I mean, shit, he curses, yeah. But
never around children.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: No criminal record, no parking tickets
f’Christ’s sake, no bad habits, even. Sex, yeah. But man is a sexual
being.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Fuckin’ Darwinian. Can’t do shit about that,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Wouldn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Yeah. No. Of course not. I’m not
advocating celibacy.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Hope not. End of the human fuckin’ race.</p>
<p><strong>chipeska</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Fucks large women. What can I say.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Loser! Dipshit!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wedgie!</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Pokemon.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Santa here?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh jeez.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is that your underwear?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Part of it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Where’s the rest? Never mind. What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed
elephant, not pink, but now I changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Now I don’t want an elephant at all. I want a
gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my
underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it
wouldn’t be my bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …You know when I was your age, I didn’t need
no fuckin’ gorilla, and I wasn’t any bigger than you. One day I came
crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what
he did?’</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He make it all better?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No. He kicked my ass. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You went bathroom on Mommy’s dishes?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What the fuck? No.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He try to teach you not to cry and be a
man.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk
son of a bitch. When he wasn’t busy busting my ass, he was puttin’ out
cigarettes on my neck.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The world’s fuckin’ unfair – it don’t give
ya nothing. You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need.
Stand up for yourself… stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in
the balls or something. Or don’t, I don’t give a shit. Just leave me the
hell out of it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay. Thanks, Santa.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Okay, go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Get the fuck outta here…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: ’Kay…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Time for the next lucky boy or girl to –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What gives? Where’s the grandson?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Open the rope there, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I know you?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Santa don’t do grab-ass, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Act natural.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Huh? What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you are Marcus
“The Prince” Skidmore. On Christmas Eve, you’re gonna rob this store
blind. What say we go somewhere private?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Research, that’s how. I’m a department store
detective Sherlock, that’s what I do. Seven cities in seven years.
Pretty impressive. The stores change, your names change. You always get
away clean. Yeah, pretty darn impressive. But let’s face facts – you all
are a couple of half-bucket small-timers. Because of your physical
attributes you’ve found a niche. I respect that. But you’ve also been
caught. By me. So this is the way how we gonna do things. I don’t want
to take over, I don’t even want to change your scam. Whatever you guys
do, it works. All I want is a taste. When the deed is done, we part
ways. I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take your little medicine show back
on the road.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now you listen here, you –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Easy! Easy! Just back off, Willie. I can
handle this.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Okay. Thirty percent. There’s three of us.
Thirty percent. That’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I meant thirty-three.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: And a third.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Forty.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Forty-two?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Forty-two five.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fooooooorty… eight.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Forty-nine?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …what’s one point.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Down the middle on the dough, and any
merchandise you take I look over and cherry-pick.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No! Money’s one thing, but �–</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: It ain’t Chinese menu, jagoff. I tell yea how
the way it’s gonna be. This is pricks ficks.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Pricks ficks?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ah, he’s a fuckin’ moron.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, well I guess that’s how you got the
upper hand.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Negotiating.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fuck you – you don’t like it, next year,
fuck off. I can always get another box jockey.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, and I can get another midget.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah? Where? You see us hangin’ off of
fuckin’ trees? Like fuckin’ crab apples? And even if we did, you’d never
front your own racket. ‘Cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin’
initiative. You’d fall apart without me. You’re just too fuckin’
pathetic –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: – too fuckin’ pathetic for words, you
fuckin’ loser. And you fuckin’ know it.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Roger! You’re home. Let me fix you some
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ah, fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: …Santa?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ah, nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You goin’ to work today?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You just gonna sit there?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah. Lemme alone.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: – Kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Later today, when the paramedics come and
bag up Santa…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …make sure the cops get this letter. It
tells about all the bad things that – that – what the fuck happened to
your eye?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Umm…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well goddamnit…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I didn’t know he did that.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I think I’ve turned a corner.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah? You fucking Petites now?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No no. No; I beat the crap out of some kids
today – but, you know, for a purpose. It really made me feel pretty good
about myself – like I did something constructive for a change.
Accomplished somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …You need many years of therapy. Many, many,
many, many, many… many fucking years of therapy.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Just looking…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Granma?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Granma…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Oh jeez.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Roger!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: …You’re home. Let me fix you some
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hello little boy.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hello. Santa?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …yes?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I know that Christmas Eve is in a couple days
and you have to fly around and give presents to the world and after that
you won’t be around no more.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: So I thought I’d give you your present now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What the fuck is it?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: A wooden pickle.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why’d you paint it brown?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Not paint. It’s blood from when I cut my hand
when I was making it for you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You’re welcome. Good night Santa. Good night
Mrs. Santa’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That was very nice. He’s really a nice kid,
isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hold on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nothin’… it’s just… I’m… well… I’m sorta…
fucking… touched.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …I don’t know if I can fuck…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That’s okay. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: There, there… There, there…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You wanna see my report card?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Think I did good?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who the fuck is Thurman? This is you? Your
name’s Thurman?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Thurman Merman?!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You think I did good?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Whaddya you care what I think, anyway? What
do I fuckin’ know? Better than I ever did. I never got any B’s,</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I thought maybe since at least I did good in
school, you’ll bring me a present this year. ’Cause last Christmas and
the one before that you didn’t bring no presents…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: …Even though I’m a dipshit loser.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid! Why do talk about
yourself like that? What the fuck is that about?! What’s with you
anyway? I ain’t Fucking Santa Claus! Look at me, I am living fucking
proof that there ain’t no Santa Claus!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I know there’s no Santa. I just thought maybe
you’d wanna give me a present ’cause we’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look, kicking the shit out of those kids,
that’s as generous as I can get.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You fuckin’ spic!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Sweet Jews for Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Holy motherfuck. What do you think you’re

<p><strong>willie</strong>: I pissed my pants!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Alright, let’s get him out of here. I’ll go
smooth this over with Chipeska. Food poisoning, something.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What do you mean, get him out of here?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Take him to his car.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m a
motherfuckin’ dwarf. So unless you got a forklift handy, maybe you
should lend a hand.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: That figures, you wantin’ all kinds of
set-asides and special treatment ’cause of your handicap. You’re all the
same.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Special treatment? I’m three fucking feet
tall, asshole – it’s a matter of physics! Draw me a sketch how I get him
to the car!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Bitch, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sketch it up, fuckin’ moron. Fuckin’

<p><strong>gin</strong>: What did you call me, thigh-high?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I called you a fuckin’ guinea Homo. From the
fifteenth fuckin’ century.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I could stick you up my ass, smallfry.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah? You sure it ain’t too sore from last

ribs.</p>

<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Lois’ foot stepping on the gas pedal.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Lois drives backwards. There’s a bump and the
sound of a dull POP.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: A large bubble gum bubble pops.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: ’Tendo it is.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Everything I touch turns to shit and
dies.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What are you, drinking Sterno now? ’Cause
you’re sounding like my Aunt Tilly right before she smeared her own shit
on the bedroom walls and we had to lock her up and she spent the rest of
her life with a shaved head and eating lunch through a tube up her
nose…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …You better be in shape by this evening, fat
man. After tonight, I don’t give a shit. But this is the time to reach
deep down and suck it up.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …Lovely boy.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Attention shoppers, the store will be
closing in five minutes. We wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy
Chanukah and a joyous Kwanza.</p>

<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s a Kitnerboy Redoubt.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …You know Andy Pitts?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah, Andy Pizzarelli?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, Andy Lapitski. Andy Pizzarelli is Andy
Blue Balls.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Huh-uh, since he got married they call him
An – WHAT’S YOUR FUCKING</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Andy Lapitski can get into anything.
Anything. They say he’s been in Margaret Thatcher’s pussy.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yeah? YEAH?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: In the joint he told me that the
Kitnerboy…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …cannot be cracked.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: ARE YOU FUCKIN’ SHITTIN’ ME?! Are you
tellin’ me after I’ve propped you up and held you together and smiled
for all those kids and danced for all those fucking housewives in a
fucking lime-green fucking velvet elf costume YOU CANNOT GET IN THAT</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No… I’m saying it’s gonna take me a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …I’ll be right back. I gotta grab one
thing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Shit… which did he say?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, I don’t think that store dick is gonna

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Store dick don’t want shit.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wuddya mean, fucking guy’s greedier

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …Fuck the fuckin’ store dick.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Dead, huh…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …I didn’t even know he was sick.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Willie. This has been a long time
comin’.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Every year you’re worse. Every year, less
reliable. More booze. More bullshit. More butt-fucking.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sure. The three B’a.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You gotta be able to rely, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re monsters.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Believe me, Willie: there’s no joy in this
for me.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, I don’t mean layin’ me out. I understand
that. But just look at ya. All the shit… grabbin’ all this shit – do you
really need all this junk? …This is Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh please. Don’t gimme that trite
“commercialism” crap. This is what we do, Willie. We get the shit.
Christmas time, we get the shit. Because we are men. And Lois. It is
Christmas, Willie, and we are men, and Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: …Wuddya waitin’ for, honey? Plug him.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Good-bye, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>megaphone voice</strong>: Drop the gun, munchkin!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Huh? !</p>
<p><strong>megaphone voice</strong>: And you, Santa! – drop the
elephant!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …Where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Tipped off.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Fuckin’ kid!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: All three of you are in so much shit it’s
almost unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Gevalt.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh yeah? Well come’n get us, coppers!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …fuck me fuck me fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …It’s Christmas… and the fucking kid is
getting his present.</p>
<p><strong>megaphone voice</strong>: Halt, put your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: All right, boys – nail him!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin’
kids!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Dear kid. I hope that you got my present and
that there wasn’t too much blood on it, although there was blood on the
present you gave me which didn’t keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the
blood doesn’t matter so much I guess.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Anyway, just in case they took it as
evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it’s the right size. I
am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred
percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn’t hit
any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha.
Anyways…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Thank you for giving that letter to the
cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it’s a good thing you did or
Santa’s little helper would’ve plugged his ass. And now the cops know I
wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone
agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa
was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like
fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gonna make
me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again
embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …As for my little helper, I am sorry to have
to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be
exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn’t go sucking
shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to
take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa’s sister
watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They
made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit… anyway, she makes better
money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and
Jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …So I’ll be staying in Phoenix now, telling
the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go.
They’re supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so I’ll see
you when I come over to fuck Mrs. Santa’s sister in the Jacuzzi. Until
then, don’t take no shit from nobody. Least of all yourself. Anyways…
see ya soon…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Santa.</p>
