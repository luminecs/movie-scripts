<p><strong>girl student</strong>: Don’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I never do.</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: You work with your hands, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Redhead.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Luther. Your life would be a whole lot simpler
if you could learn to operate a V.C.R.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: My only failing.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: It’s okay – I told him I was sick – anyway,
he’s gone – relax…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You fucking bastard.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: You little whore –</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Kill her?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: No choice in the matter.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Jesus, Tim, what did we do?</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: No choice in the matter.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Do you realize what a shitstorm we’re in?
Go on – tell me.</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: Nothing to tell. He screamed.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: And you heard no sounds of violence ’til
then?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Nothing we haven’t heard before.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Maybe I should call the police now.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Bill? Why don’t you think about that? Take
a second and just think about that. Think… real… fucking… hard.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Probably not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Okay – here’s what happened tonight – poor
Christy came home alone and interrupted a burglary. That sound
logical?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We’re going to have to sanitize this place.
Alan, did you have sex with her?</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: … Don’… ’member…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Bill, you’re going to have to examine
her.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I’m no gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I just made you one.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: It’s got their prints on it.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Gloria – I killed her –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s all going to be fine, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: … But she’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: … I’ll take care of everything just like I
always do. Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: I got his license number.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman –
don’t forget to check under the bed – – You may have buried us! –</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: – relax, I got his license number, remember?
–</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: – you think he’s going to just sit around
waiting for us? – Asshole –</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: – take it easy, Miss Russell –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – everybody shut up, all right?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Oh boy…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: A two-way mirror.</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: – I better get cracking on that license
number –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: – it’s all we’ve got – and he’s got the
letter opener – blood, fingerprints – Jesus, think what he can do –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – the man is a thief – a thief who witnessed
a murder –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – it looks like he stole a whole bunch of
money – I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. He’s going to run like
hell.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jordan beat us at the buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Bad night.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Kate. Kate.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Probably too late for me to take it up.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The jogging.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Ahh.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Dumb way to start this, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: About?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are
starting to get cold.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That happens this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I was thinking of maybe relocating.
Someplace with a kinder climate. I just wanted to check it out with you
first… … you’re the only family I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Luther, you don’t have me.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Kate –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – you know what it’s like being the only kid
in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: This move – I’m talking permanent, you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We don’t see each other anyway – we haven’t
seen each other since Mom died and that’s a year. Look, you chose your
life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have
no plans to be around for you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – wait a minute – you’re lying about
something, aren’t you? –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – no –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – are you active again? – is that why you’re
here now?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – no –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – I don’t believe you – – Christ, Father, what
have you done?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Christy Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Wife of Walter – most likely came
home and stumbled onto a burglary –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – some burglary.</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: I wish my carpets were this clean. And
I can’t find a single decent fingerprint.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You serious, Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: It’s like Mary Poppins was here.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Could someone have let him in?</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan
household went to Barbados two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Thank you for your support.</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: Wait – it gets worse – – the shots came
from here. If she interrupted a burglary, she should have been here – –
she was killed where she is – all the blood patterns indicate that. But
she was looking toward the bed – what in hell was she looking at?</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: Looks like someone sat here – but I
couldn’t find any prints. You think Sullivan holed up in the chair and
watched his wife perform?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I hope not – – he’s such a great man.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Careful digging that out.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Looks like he tried to strangle
her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So he tried to strangle her, then went to the
door and shot her from behind?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: He also inspected her vagina.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He did what? Why?</p>
<p><strong>laura simon</strong>: Maybe he couldn’t remember if he fucked
her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: A strong burglar with a weak mind – obviously
another open and shut case…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Mr. Sullivan? – I’m Seth Frank, senior
homicide detective for Middleton County –</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: – my client is in no mood for
conversation, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: It’s all right, Sandy – – you’re in
charge of the case?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I have to ask some questions, but it can be
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: You want what, positive
identification? Yes, that was my wife. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’d been in Barbados for two days?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I took the entire staff down –
always do this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: But Mrs. Sullivan didn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: She was, had it all planned, but
you know women, they change their minds.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I’d been married to my Rebecca for
forty-seven years and when she died, I decided I never wanted that pain
again. One thing I knew about Christy: she was going to outlive me.</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: I think that’s enough for today.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I have to ask about the vault.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: You mean the contents of the vault
of course – – Sandy, you go on, I’m all right. Really. Go to the
reception – obviously I can’t make it, but I’m sure everyone will
understand.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I know it’s not the contents – You
mean the chair. You have to ask about the chair.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yessir, I do.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: But why? Are they connected?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I think someone sat in it – and I think that
someone may have been involved in the murder. You were my father’s hero,
Mr. Sullivan, I promise you this won’t make my highlight reel.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I’d hoped I could satisfy her… but
you know… she had needs and she didn’t want to go behind my back… she
suggested the chair… she hoped I might get to like sitting there… … I
didn’t… I’ve tried for eighty years to live a decent life. I’ve given a
billion dollars to charity. If this comes to trial, none of that will be
remembered – I’ll just go out as the joke of the world.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I understand, sir; I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Will you listen to me whine? Please
forgive me, Mr. Frank. Just do your job. And I’ll do mine.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sandy. Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Take a walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Tell me about Walter – how is he?</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: Eighty and alone, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: He understands officially my hands are
tied?</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: Mr. President, he’s touched at your
concern.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Any news of the killer? Well, why isn’t
there? Who’s in charge of the case?</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: Top man – eight years homicide work in
New York. But I understand how you feel – it’s hard to be patient.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: No one understands how I feel – I’m
supposed to have all this power but I can’t help my oldest friend – you
know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here
– and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: – I’ll hold a press conference – and I’ll
have Walter come – and I will embrace him before the world.</p>
<p><strong>sandy lord</strong>: He’ll treasure that, Mr. President. What
a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Damn tennis elbow is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: This thing’s worse, Gloria. I need to see
a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: The country would have to be informed,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: What happened to my right to privacy? I
think she nicked a tendon.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Burton says it’s a flesh wound –</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: – when did you become such an expert,
Bill? – Ever been wounded? –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Yes, sir. Many times.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Are you serious about that press
conference, Alan?</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Of course I am – Walter’s been like a
father to me.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for
it?</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: I think Mrs. Richmond’s mission to help
the poor in Asia should not be interrupted. We know anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We checked his license plate – he stole the
car from a police impoundment lot.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: We’re not dealing with a fool here. Has he
initiated contact?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Burton doesn’t think he will.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: I agree. Sorry about my behavior – won’t
happen again; think of it as a blip on the screen. And as far as I’m
concerned, so is he.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: He could be a little more than that, Alan –
he saw.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: He saw nothing – a drunk woman who liked
rough sex too much. And he’s a burglar. Who’s going to believe him?
After all, it’s not as if he had evidence or anything…</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: What happened to my right to privacy? I
think she nicked a tendon.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You always did disappear good, Luther.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You mean I’ve got a weak face. Thanks,
Val.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’re lucky is all – some of my customers,
they stand out no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: How many passports you need?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Four should cover it.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Now you’ll want different looks, and
matching international driver’s licenses – I’ll throw in some dummy
credit cards, seeing it’s you. How the rugs I made you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: They’re good. Beards and mustaches, too.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I try to give value for money. Leaving the
country permanent?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It may come to that.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Matter where you’ve been? – I hate doing
those goddam Asian passport stamps.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Europe’s fine. Maybe the Caribbean for
winters. When can I pick up?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Usually takes some time, but for you, I’ll
rush it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Thanks, Val. I’ve always been able to count
on you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t want to know what you’re into, but
leaving forever…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I never figured you for a runner – thirty
percent of my runners kill themselves within five years.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Five years doesn’t sound so bad to me just
now.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: See if any of this makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and
surprise a burglar.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Now you’re the burglar coming out of the
vault and being surprised.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Gold star. I draw my gun –</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: – then why do you bother to strangle her when
you could just shoot?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s nothing – why do I bother to have her
strip and then put her clothes back on?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: There I can help you – see, before you were a
burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: And I dress her because?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: She was a good customer and you didn’t want
her embarrassed when the police came.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. – she
was too drunk to drive. I’ve checked every cab and limo company in the
area and not one of them knows anything. Someone drove her home.
Goddamit, who? And why haven’t they come forward?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You saying the burglar drove her home? I hate
this case.</p>
<p><strong>telephone repairman</strong>: Lieutenant? – sorry to bother
you – I’ve got your phone working again, shouldn’t give you any more
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good service, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>telephone repairman</strong>: Part of the job.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh yeah – remember that bullet hole in the
wall? Had the lab dig out the slug – guess what – no slug – why does the
burglar take the time to do that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Different from the one in her body?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh I like that a lot – two different guns
means two different burglars. Two guys broke in? And they both went out
the window? Bullshit. And oh, by the way, why does he – or they – go out
the window in the first place when he – or they – got in by breaking a
zillion- dollar security system? –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: – Seth?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: A Bill Burton of the Secret Service in the
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Here, you solve the goddam thing. Did I
mention that I hate this case? I really truly hate this case – you
cannot imagine how much I hate it –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Bill Burton, hi –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – hi, Seth Frank –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – I know you must be going crazy – but the
boss is very interested in your progress. Maybe we can help each
other.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What did you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: You know how close he and Sullivan are? The
minute anything breaks, if you’d call me, I’d tell the President. That
way, he’d be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan – it would mean a lot to
him. And any red tape you want cut – done. Here are my numbers.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Leads?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Still trying to figure out what might have
happened –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – I loved playing Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You Secret Service guys do that?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I was State Trooper here ten years ago
before the Government got me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re that Bill Burton.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I was younger and dumber then. Keep in
touch.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: The chef makes them especially for
me – I promise you they’re sinful.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: This is a new arena for me, but
from what I’m told, you have a flawless reputation, Mister McCarty –
which is why I need to employ you.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I have no idea who I’m after. Until
I do, you will have to wait in Washington for instructions.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: When I was 10 my father died – he
was a miner and lung disease killed him. I became rich at 25 and the
first thing I did was purchase that mine, close it, and give every miner
there fifty thousand dollars to retire on. You will come to Washington,
Mr. McCarty. You will put one million dollars expenses into the Swiss
bank account of your choosing. And, when the time comes, two million
dollars a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Selling sin is easy…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Luther Whitney – – one of the great thieves of
the world.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Been going nuts with this thing, up all night
and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around
dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn’t two burglars but what if it was
one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? Called a
buddy at the Bureau – they keep track of this stuff internationally – he
says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the
Sullivan job – I’m tracing all six – – but Whitney’s the only one lives
in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why haven’t I ever heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Because he hasn’t been arrested in thirty
years.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: This his graduation picture from Harvard?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Ancient history – he wasn’t a jewel thief back
then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser. But since he
got out the last time, he’s only worked alone –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – and no one’s touched him. He gets questioned
whenever anything big comes up. But nothing sticks.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Seth – we can make this stick – I’ll bet you
anything this is our guy – a local? – can’t ask for more –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We’ve got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: – what? –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whitney hasn’t killed anyone in 45 years.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Korea.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Big deal, so he’s a veteran.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Not just a veteran – a wounded veteran. Got
his combat record here. Battles, commendations, decorations up the
kazoo. Lives alone on his disability. Says he does anyway. And I don’t
do war heroes…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Boy, you must be smart.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Usually takes a week for you guys to get to
me. You look just like your picture, Seth. I’m Luther Whitney.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: So, do you want my confession now or after
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Before I send you away for life, I should
probably check out your alibi.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Watched the Bullets game with Red Bransford.
Prison buddy of mine – runs a bar – want to question me about the game?
I’m probably lying.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You been following the case?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I love true crime –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have
handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. I’ve got a list here;
you’re on it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I wish it was true. Your robber actually
went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the
middle of the night? If only I could do stuff like that – I’d be the
star of my A.A.R.P. meetings.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Luther? Why was this so hard?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You want me to help solve your case?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just looking for insight. How would you –
scratch that – how would one go about it? What kind of person do you
think I should be looking for?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Older fella. Like me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Need patience. The secret is just research,
research, research – from everything I’ve read.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Research for what?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it’s
not a small house. There had to be an architect, right? You’d be able to
tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the
office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them
back before morning.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Not just steal them?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Seth – breaking in isn’t hard – what’s hard
is breaking in so no one knows you’ve been there. Now, after the
architect, next you’d want the contractor’s office – and the security
company’s office. You know the skill involved breaking the security of a
security company? I wonder how those guys do it?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why go to all that trouble?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Papers said he kept the money in a vault,
yes? Well, I’m guessing there was probably some secret way to open it
–</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – clicker –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – explain –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – gizmo – looked like a V.C.R. remote –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – amazing – – must have been a lot of money
inside.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Five million.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why’s that funny?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The way you said it – as if you were trying
to surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I was trying to surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Would the burglar use a disguise?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Seth, you’ve got to get with the program you
expect to catch this guy – most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some
kind of weird loner?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Maybe like you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m the perfect prototype. But you see any
face often enough, you’ll start putting things together. That’s why
these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of
years back – damn, I wish I could remember where – anyway, it was about
these makeup experts some of them use – wigmakers, people like that.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Go on about the wigmakers.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’d love that but I’m late as it is – got to
get my pacemaker checked. – all this excitement, you understand.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You don’t have a pacemaker, and I’ll be back
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Tomorrow is promised to no one.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Not ’til morning? – I’ll be by early –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Katie darling, you’ve gotta try real food
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: I am having this press conference here
because…</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: … it is here, at this courthouse, that
Christine Sullivan’s killer will be tried for his crime.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Turn that off, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: In a sec.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: As you know, I came from an impoverished
family in an impoverished town – but we lived with our doors
unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: We all lock our doors now, but that is not
what concerns me…</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: … we are also locking our hearts… that is
the sadness, that is the loss.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: We are locking our hearts to the cries of
the weary, we are locking our hearts to the poor and their pain…</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: … Sisters and brothers, we are locking our
hearts to ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Put it back on.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You said –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Do it –</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: We feel savagery and violence must be
allowed a place at table. That is wrong. That is not America. I shall
fight that battle.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Dear friend, old friend, we shall fight
that battle.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Who can explain the ways of chance? If we
had never met, I would not be President. If Christine had not taken ill,
she would be with you in Barbados even now. Oh, Walter, you’ve always
been like a father to me. I would give the world to lessen your
pain.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You – heartless – prick – – you – fucking –
bastard –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m not running – not from you. I’m going to
bring you down…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: He was in the building – he took a guided
tour.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’ve never dealt with blackmail –</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: – he doesn’t want money –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: – you a mind reader too?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: No, I just looked on the back – – see? –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: ‘I don’t want money.’</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: This guy sure has the guts of a burglar.
Wish we had him.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You finished your recruiting speech?
Because I’d like to know how I handle this.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Like you handled the letter opener?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Gee, Bill, that could be construed as
criticism. Do you really want me as an enemy?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Miss Russell, I should have called the
police that night. But I was weak. You convinced me to stay silent. I
regret that. Know this: every time I see your face I want to rip your
throat out.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Fine – you win the pissing contest – – what
should I do?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Nothing – because he’s making a terrible
mistake, he thinks he has time – he doesn’t – Seth Frank’s too good.
He’ll bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: Then I kill him.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: For a tough prosecutor, you don’t resemble
your reputation, Miss Whitney.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Is that good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Look, Lieutenant – I told you on the phone,
I’m simply not involved with my father, so this may not be a waste of
time for you, but it sure is for me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What would you do if I just turned around and
left?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Report you as an incompetent.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re exactly like your reputation, Miss
Whitney –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m assuming your father’s a big part of you
–</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – what? –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – You think it’s all coincidence? He’s a thief
and you just happen to be the toughest prosecutor in the area?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Wow – that never crossed my mind – you think
there might be some connection? – Like maybe I’m somehow compensating? –
I better write that down.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – Luther disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I think you can help me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Lieutenant – I don’t know the man – he was in
jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live
by ourselves. We don’t make contact. He doesn’t care about me. I’ve seen
him all of once this past year.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Couple days ago. He said he might be going
away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work now?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Any idea where he might have gone?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Quit wasting my time – if he doesn’t want you
to find him, you’re not going to find him.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You saying he’s left town, skipped the
country, what?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m saying you won’t recognize him. I’m saying
he could be just around the corner – he always kept a safe house –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – where? –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He never said –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – Then where’d you hear this?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – my mother loved him, all right? – Even after
she left him – even when she was dying she always talked about him – ‘If
only he hadn’t this,’ ‘if only he could have that’ –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I meet a lot of asshole cops like you – guys
who O.D.’d on Columbo –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – Lady, I may be an asshole cop but you don’t
know me well enough to call me one –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – There’s something else, isn’t there?
Something you want me to do? – But you won’t say —</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How long did he live here?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Years.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Never been.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Strange place for a thief to leave a key,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He always did that…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He sure took off in a hurry. What scares a
professional thief like that?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: … but he wasn’t at those places… … college
graduation; law school graduation; the night Mom and I celebrated when I
got a job; and me alone on the steps? – I’d just won my first case, I
was so proud… … I used to think… sometimes I’d come home and I’d sense
he’d been in my apartment, checking the fridge, shaking his head because
he never thought I ate right… It’s crazy but I just knew Daddy was
watching over me…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You can do a good thing, Kate – – help me
bring him in. Just leave a message on his phone machine, you’re worried
about him.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: … No…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s the truth – you are worried about him –
this isn’t your normal case – his life may be in danger – you can save
him, make the call –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: … He won’t come…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Of course he’ll come. You’re all he has.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Kate, he’s on the run and he’s scared and he’s
right to be scared because he’s going to get caught – you don’t know the
heat on this.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Maybe he is innocent. If
so I’ll have him home and dry in a few hours. But what happens if some
hotshot who’s trying to make a reputation tracks him down? I can
guarantee his safety. You make the call, I make a promise: You’ll have
your father, home and dry…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I left a message on his machine, he called
back within an hour; we’re meeting tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: An open-air place near my office, the Cafe
Alonzo –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Four o’clock – it’s deserted then.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I need to look really good today.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Business? It’s a woman, I can tell. Never
too late, is it?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: The Boss is very grateful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Figured he’d like an eyewitness report of the
capture. This is our guy – if he’s innocent, he sure took off awful
fast.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Miss? What you want please?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Nothing, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Got to.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You sit you eat please.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: This is not part of my brilliant master
plan.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Unfuckingbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m waiting for someone.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: He must eat too, please.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh he will, we both will – we’ll order half
the menu – but just not now –</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Cheesecake gone.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I did not kill that woman, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Messy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I like that in a woman.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Top number’s local police – – other two are my
office and home. I live alone, too, call anytime. Want me to get someone
to spend the night?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I just need some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’ve got surveillance outside. And I’m keeping
it on ’til this is over. I’ve got a feeling he’s going to try and
contact you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re on a hot streak, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Listen, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Anything unusual, call me right away – not a
bother, I live alone.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You said.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Feeble, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Anything for the road? I’ve got water and
water.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Pelligrino would be great. What’s funny, I say
it wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Tired is all.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t think I’ve told you this, but I live
alone. Lock it behind me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Real good. Try and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: her back to her</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You’re not the first.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Why’d you come?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You have to know I’m not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No, this afternoon. To the restaurant. Why’d
you come then? You must have suspected something, or you wouldn’t have
been prepared.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: My daughter wanted to see me.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The robbery went fine ’til they came in.
They were drunk. I hid in the vault. Sex got rough. He was going to kill
Christy, but she turned the tables, was going to kill him. Two guys came
in, shot her dead.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: The same two guys who tried for you this
afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Probably only one of them. I think Walter
Sullivan might have hired the other.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Pretty powerful enemy; good going.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Not as powerful as the President of the
United States.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Richmond was drunk. The two guys are Secret
Service. Chief of Staff Russell planned the coverup.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Every word true.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re saying you’re innocent of the murder?
Why in the world should I believe you?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Because I swear on Mattie’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: On your mother’s grave, Kate – you know I’d
kill myself before I’d lie about that.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Jesus, Luther.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: They’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Can you run?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I was set to. At the airport. All the money
I’d ever need.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: But I saw that bastard using Sullivan on the
T.V. – maybe I couldn’t have saved that woman, Kate. But I didn’t even
try. I know what you think of me and I know what we’ve been to each
other – – haven’t been to each other. And it’s not the time to try and
explain my life –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – but I’ve never robbed anyone couldn’t
afford it and I’ve never stiffed a waitress. And Alan Richmond has to
pay.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What can you do?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Not much, maybe – but I only went to jail
when I had partners. People betray each other, Kate – nowadays, when
there’s a group, someone wants to write a book –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – these people hate each other. And if I can
drive them just a little bit nuts, who knows how they’ll react under
pressure? Glad for the talk, wish we’d had more.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: This is probably it; you understand that. I
was never going to tell you this, but I watched you argue a case last
year – thank God you got your brains from your mother.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s dangerous outside.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It always is – – and I may not make you
proud, Kate – – but I’m not going down alone…</p>
<p><strong>well-dressed man</strong>: For Miss Gloria Russell.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Want me to sign anything?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: You’re a vision this evening, Miss
Russell.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: For? Come again?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You sent it to me this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Well, of course. Excuse me, all – I am
overcome with the desire to dance with my Chief of Staff.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: What is this nonsense? I’m hoping there’s
an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Your gift, Alan – I was overwhelmed – and
your note was so gratifying –</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: – I sent a note?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Yes, yes, you think I don’t know your
writing? I assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: It is lovely, Gloria – and you know what
else?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: What, Alan?</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Christy Sullivan wore it the night she was
killed.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: You realize what this means? Whitney’s
been heard from.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s not precisely the first time,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: You’ve been keeping things from me?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Only because you have so much on your
plate, Alan; we wanted to spare you. He sent me a Polaroid of the letter
opener yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Well, now – – I need time to think – come
see me in my office in the morning – This will certainly make for an
interesting chapter in my memoirs.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: Needed a pen.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: There’s pens – – you don’t trust me? –</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: – I don’t answer to you, asshole –</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You’re both assholes, now move –</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: his voice is, when he</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I talked to Seth Frank – apparently Whitney
learned how in prison.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Very gifted man.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: And are we close to stopping him?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We’re working round the clock.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Good to know that.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: He’ll make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: Good to know that too.</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: There is one other thing you’ll want to
take care of.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: You’re sure you want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>richmond</strong>: She’s a young prosecutor, prosecutors ask
questions – she might know what he knows… Let’s get cracking, shall we?
Show you love your country.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Sorry, Miss Whitney, but this thing’s giving
us a little trouble.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Kate okay?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m not staying on long enough for you to
track this, just answer me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She couldn’t be in better hands – talk about
catching a break, Secret Service called me. They’re taking over
surveillance –</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Got it working fine, Miss Whitney.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: … Kate…?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Scream. Go on. Which do you want most, for
me to kill you or life in jail forever?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Going to guess this wasn’t to pep her
up.</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: … you’re not going to kill me…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: … why do you think that…?</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: … you could have but you didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: That’s because you didn’t know your crime,
prick.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: whispering into Collin’s</p>
<p><strong>collin</strong>: … mercy…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m fresh out.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: … Daddy…?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: … go to sleep, honey…</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I need one answer – when you interviewed
Walter Sullivan, did he say why Christy didn’t go to Barbados?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just that she changed her mind. You know who
did it, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: So will you – check your phones –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – who’d tap a police officer?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Is this a shortcut, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: I’m your replacement driver for the
evening, sir. Don’t worry, Tommy’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Very unusual – what do I call
you?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Luther, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: And are you familiar with how to
get to my home, Luther?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I know the way, sir – I’m the man who robbed
you –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – and you’re the man who tried to have me
killed –</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: – I’m sorry I missed – I believe in
the Old Testament, sir – there is nothing wrong with an eye for an eye
when a terrible deed has been done. A deed such as yours.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You want to believe that, don’t you? – Makes
your life a lot simpler if you believe that, isn’t that right? What do
you think I gain being here?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Have no idea – you going to rob me
again? –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I don’t need your money, Mr. Sullivan. Look
in your vault lately?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I’m afraid we’re a little late for
an attempt at leniency.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Shit’s coming down tonight, Mr. Sullivan, do
you want to be a player or not? Do you want to know what happened, or
not? I saw. Your call.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Are you up to hearing about it? – Do you
want to hear how he beat the shit out of her and tried to strangle her –
you have enough left for that? –</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: – I could walk through fire –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I was in the chair when they came in. They
were drunk – at first he only wanted to bruise her – she fought back, he
went for the kill – she turned the tables. Then he screamed for
help.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Who else was in my house?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Secret Service shot her.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Gloria Russell handled the cover up.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Stop this –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – don’t you want to know who the man
was?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: It was you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: We’re too old to bullshit each other,
Mr. Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Who was it then?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You know!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You fucking well do, don’t shake your head
at me – when you’re alone at night, when the rage takes you and you
think of what you’d do to revenge her, on those nights you put a face to
your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Stop the car –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – we’re going all the way, Walter –</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: – it’s too terrible.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: … I know about Alan’s reputation as
a philanderer… but… he would never dream of betraying me… I gave him the
Presidency.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The press conference – remember? – he held
you in his arms and said if only Christy hadn’t gotten sick she would
have been with you in Barbados –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: – how do you think he knew she was sick? You
didn’t tell anybody. But he heard it, all right. He heard it from her.
That night. And I heard every word –</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: That’s not real proof.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: You could have stolen this.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I did steal it. But that isn’t my blood and
those aren’t my prints.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: I did love her, you know.</p>
<p><strong>walter sullivan</strong>: Is he working late? I haven’t an
appointment but I’d like to see him if I might.</p>

me forever. Of course I tried to stop him – – Alan was like a son to

<p><strong>luther</strong>: You were forever catching colds.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: … am I going to be all right?….</p>
