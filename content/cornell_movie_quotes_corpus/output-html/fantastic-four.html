<h1 id="fantastic-four">fantastic-four</h1>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: High open space, exposed structural elements.
Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of… smallness,
inadequacy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good thing it ain’t workin… Reed, what are we
doing here? This guy’s fast-food, strip-mall science –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: This wasn’t our first stop, in case you forgot
NASA. And Victor’s not that bad. He’s just a little… Larger than
life.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s financed some of the biggest
breakthroughs of this century.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’d never know it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jesus. That too?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see –</p>
<p><strong>female receptionist</strong>: Executive elevator, top
floor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s the price for a smile round here?</p>
<p><strong>bright holograms</strong>: Stars. Planets. They hover in the
air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: My research suggests that exposure to a
high-energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the
evolution of early planetary life.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: In six weeks another cloud with the same
elemental profile will pass Earth’s orbit. A study in space could
advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help
cure countless diseases, extend human life –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Give kids the chance to be stronger,
healthier, less prone to –</p>
<p><strong>shadowed figure</strong>: Turn it off. Please.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: But I haven’t fully explained my –</p>
<p><strong>shadowed figure</strong>: Yes you have… Imagination.
Creativity. Passion. Those were always your trademarks.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But dreams don’t pay the bills, do they?
Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with
the world on your back.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You remember in school we talked about working
together. That’s what I was about to explain…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So it’s not my money you want. It’s my toys…
Tell me: if NASA doesn’t trust you, why should I?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That’s my job. To stay a step ahead. To know
what other men don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t take this.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben. This is business. Just work.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He’s right, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s just business.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I think you both know my Director of Genetic
Research, Susan Storm.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Heya Susie. One more thing he’s got.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben, it’s been too long.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You’re, you’ve, I mean, how have you bee–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Never better.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This isn’t going to be a problem, is it?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ancient history.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Good. Then you’re just in time to hear the
great Reed Richards ask me for help. You know, you made a lot of folks
at MIT feel like a junior high science fair. So you’ll excuse me if I
savor the moment.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You back this mission, and I’ll sign over a
fair percentage of any applications or –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The number’s seventy-five. And it’s
applications and patents.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What about his first born?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, the money’s not important. We could save
lives.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on, isn’t it? Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Deal…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Well then, to our future. Together.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Funny how things turn out, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: If Reed’s right, then this little trip will
double our stock offering.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: And if he’s not…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed’s always right. Good thing he doesn’t
always know what he’s got…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to
shut us down –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, think about all the people we can help if
this works –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe you should think about yourself for once.
You always let this guy push you round –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We got what we wanted. That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know, I know. I’m just worried about what he
wants… Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You sure about this, Reed?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored
them into my coordinates and –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I was talking about us. Working together.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Well, uh, based on our history…you can handle
the biogenetics, and I’ll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe
I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some
background in electropho–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Right. That’s exactly what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Way to not overthink it. So when do we
leave?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’ll schedule the launch. Call me in the
morning to talk about resources and crew.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I, uh, think I remember the number.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s been changed.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot
the mission –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Well, he’s welcome to ride shotgun, but we
already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can’t do it. I cannot do it.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its
just like the shuttles you flew in –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. I cannot take orders from that underwear
model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret
wannabes into a flight simulator.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Youthful high spirits.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They crashed it into a wall. A flight
simulator.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m sure he’s matured since then.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: When have I asked you to do something you
absolutely said you could not do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Five times.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I had it at four.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This makes five.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Captain on the bridge!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59. The
look on your hard-ass former CO’s grill when he finds out he’s your
junior officer: priceless.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can handle the ship. I can even handle
Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don’t know if I should be flying or playing
Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor did.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting
to your individual needs to –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side
cool!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Wow. Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Material made from self-regulating unstable
molecules. I’ve been working on a formula for this.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Great minds think alike.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Guess some think faster than others.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I hired Armani to design the pattern. These
colors will look great on camera.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: They’re ready for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Showtime.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO’s
tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank’s five times oversubscribed
–</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s not just the money. I could make money
in my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: History, Leonard. History. Everything else
is conversation… How’s the other matter?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Harry Winston sends his regards.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Today we stand on the edge of a new
frontier. In the furthest depths of outer space…we will find the secrets
to inner space. The final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a
cosmic storm…</p>
<p><strong>behind the action</strong>: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk
past. News crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture.
Our “Fantastic Four” are not exactly big news. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Isn’t that your speech?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s made a few changes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one
up there.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor’s better at these things.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll be watching over you.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Just get back soon, or I start looking for a
new groom.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Soon as I’m back, I’m gonna trade that in for a
bigger rock.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t care about rocks, I care about you.
You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your
mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Actually, the engines are SMEs.
Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.
I’m not as dumb as you look.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Think of a world without genetic flaws – no
asthma, allergies, baldness, breast cancer…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s wrong with being bald…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Darwin discovered evolution. Now we – I –
will define it. Only in America could…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …a little country boy from Latveria build
one of the biggest companies in the world, and truly reach the stars.
Now if you’ll excuse me, history awaits…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: If you behave, maybe next time daddy’ll let
you drive.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Keep talking, there won’t be a next time.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Long way from the projection booth at the
Hayden Planetarium, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Leonard, how’s the feed?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We can monitor the cloud’s approach and observe
the tests from here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is it safe?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The shields on the station should protect
us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Should?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What’s wrong, Ben? Eighty-million dollars
worth of equipment not enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Let’s start loading those samples. Get your
suit ready, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So you still do all the heavy lifting?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Maybe you should have stayed back in the
lab. Field work never suited you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He does the talking. I do the walking. Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Got it. So take a walk, Ben…I’m going to
borrow Susan for a second.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Please tell me your dawg’s not trying to
rekindle things with my sister.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: ’Course not. Strictly business.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, well, his eyes say different.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe
she’s not over it either.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s see: you got Victor, stud of the year,
more coin than God? Or Reed, the world’s dumbest smart guy worth less
than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it’s a toss-up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Put your tiny little mind at ease.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t you wander off, boy.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Surprised I agreed to Reed’s proposal?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I understand the business reasons.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Well, when you’re looking at your future, it
never hurts to find closure about the past.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Susan, every man dreams that he’ll meet some
woman he can give the world to.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: In my case, it’s not just a metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No…no…impossible. It’s…too fast.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’ve been with me two years now.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s been a good two years, Victor… The
company’s accomplished so much.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Right, of course, the company… But you see,
I’ve come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing
without someone to share them with –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Uh, Victor, I hope I haven’t done something to
make you think…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Sue, I’ve lived my life unafraid of taking
big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this
as a promotion. A merger of sorts… Four little words that can change our
lives…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The cloud is accelerating!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I don’t know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’ve got minutes until it hits, not
hours…Victor, that storm’s deadly – the radiation’s lethal. We need to
abort.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Get a grip. Reed. We didn’t come all this
way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the
shields…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben’s still out there –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So reel him in. But we came here to do a
job. So let’s do it. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, we need you back inside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I ain’t done arranging your flowers,
egghead.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben. This is serious. Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Roger that, on my way.</p>
<p><strong>automated voice</strong>: Event threshold in two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Come on, Ben, come on…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed, we’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny… Reed…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed, you need to get up here so we can
close the shields! Now!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Not until Ben is back inside!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s too late for him, and soon it’ll be too
late for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Raising the shields.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You can’t leave them out there.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Watch me. Reed had his chance. You can’t
help them any more than I can.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor’s right. Johnny, get to the command
center. Close the shields.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on big guy, you can do it!</p>
<p><strong>automated voice</strong>: Event threshold in thirty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>automated voice</strong>: Event threshold in ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny! Reed!</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Everyone frozen in position as:</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door
closes, a SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben in
the back, ripping through his suit. The exterior door shuts and seals.
The station loses all power. DARKNESS.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s not responsive –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ben! Ben!</p>
<p><strong>johnny’s voice</strong>: Ben, wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>subjective camera, ben’s pov</strong>: The blurry image of
Johnny comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where…where am I?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Back on Earth. Victor’s medical facility…
We’re in quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Reed? … Sue?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They’re fine. Everybody else…is fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I swear to you they’ve done everything
humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had
the best –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Give me a mirror…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They said that’s not such a good idea, the
shock alone could –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Give me the god damn mirror!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Unfortunately, the doctors just couldn’t do
anything to fix your face!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nice ’do. Going for the “grandpa” look?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: You’ve been accused in the past of
moving science a little too fast –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Accused by who? My competitors?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: But surely this accident gives you
pause –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Danger is always part of discovery. What
would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm? Without
risk, there’s no reward.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: So where’s the reward? You promised a
cure-all.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And you’ll have it. I’ve never come up
short. And I’m not going to start now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: So you’re still taking VDI public –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes, of course. I’ve never been more
confident in the compan–</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Stable. Vitals are strong.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Blood panels show no irradiation. Good. You’ll
step up this protocol, every –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Four hours. We know what we’re doing… One
more day of observation, then you’re all cleared.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue…I want to tell you…I’m…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: She’s allergic to orchids. Put that Amaryllis
Apapathos by her bed. The African lilies? They’re her favorites.</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: And where do we think we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t know if “we’ve” noticed, but the
sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’ve noticed… But doctor’s orders, you’re not
allowed to leave until we –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Finish the tests, I know – could you give me
a hand with this zipper?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You know this is not a ski resort.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Luckily grandma still sends care
packages.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You are trouble.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Brubbles my Triddle Name.</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: You’re hot!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So are you!</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: I mean, you feel a little feverish.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ve never felt better in my life. When do
you get off work?</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: My shift ends at four, but I couldn’t
–</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That’ll
give you a minute to freshen up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How long was I out?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Three days. I was worried about you. How are
you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Solid.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I don’t know. I just keep going over and over
the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Reed. Even you can’t compute every little
thing.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I should have done more, run more tests –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was a freak of nature. Last I checked, you
don’t have a crystal ball. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You go through something like this, makes you
appreciate having the right woman in your life.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Reed, I’m not talking about Debbie.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What? Come on. She’s got a good thing with
Victor –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your
screws?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s smart, powerful, successful –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well maybe you should date him.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben. He’ll give her the life she deserves. She
ended up with the right guy. Things worked out for the best.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do I have to do everything myself?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Me like-y.</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: Stay right. Left is trouble.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I though we went over this.</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: Last one down springs for room
service.</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: You’re on fire!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not this again –</p>
<p><strong>sexy nurse</strong>: No: You’re ON FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Care to join me?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: How’s the IPO?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Stable. We’re looking at low twenties. It’s
a good number, considering the fallout from –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed’s disaster. You know, I half- think he
did this to me on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sir, I’m sure he wouldn’t put himself –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of
the Journal… I’ve got to do something about this scar. Make sure they
only shoot my right side.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar
“humanizes” you.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And that’s a good thing?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You know, maybe you should get some rest
–</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Later. First, I’ve got some unfinished
business. A deal that needs closing…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sir, I’ve always wondered… Why Sue? You
could have any woman in the world but –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That’s why. Because I could have any other
woman… You know, when they asked Caesar “why England,” he said, “because
it’s not mine.”</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I’ve got to
meet with Victor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wouldn’t want to keep Vic waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey Reed, what are you doing here? Great, why
don’t you join us?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: God, I’m starving. Gonna hit the buffet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Pardon me…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really bad shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Fireplace. Sue looks gorgeous in the light. A
beat. A long beat. Reed doesn’t know where to start with this woman.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: That’s good. That’s uh…good.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You always had a way with words. I should be
getting back.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m really happy for you and Victor.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You’re happy for me and Victor.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the
best part of our relationship –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Which was?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Passion.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: For science.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You are such a dork, Reed… You never got it and
never will unless it’s explained to you in quantum physics.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What? What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s never what you say. It’s what you don’t
say. What you don’t do…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I…I…I just wanted to –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s been two years, and all you can say is
you’re happy for me and some other guy… You know, Victor may be a lot of
things, but at least he’s not afraid to fight for what he wants… And
it’s nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard…seen… Reed, look at
me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh, Sue…? I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What? What do you mean you –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue…look at your hands.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: The glass flies off the table,
tumbling… Reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches
two feet out of his sleeve – grabs it just before it hits –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You guys will not believe what just
happened!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It has to be the cloud. It’s fundamentally
altered our DNA.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Let’s not jump to conclusions, we need a
massive amount of evidence before making that leap.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Now what is up with that?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The cloud has fundamentally altered our
DNA.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Cool. What’d it do to you guys?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Apparently I can disappear.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Please tell me you go silent too.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We have to find Ben.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off
–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Okay, “mom.”</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my
nurse!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Open up Ben, we need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ewwwwwwww. That is disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: …Ben?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I think that thing is Ben.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, are you feeling alright?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben did this.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ben did this?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s had some kind of…reaction to exposure
from the cloud. And he’s not the only one.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We need to find him.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, I’m sorry I –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Just find him.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Anybody know where the big guy’s going?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He’s going home.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.
Jackets rip, shoes split. He needs an extra extra extra large.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The dial pad. Big fingers try to push keys
but they’re too large. Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more and
more frustrated. He manages to press “0” with his pinky.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello, Operator?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Deb… It’s me. I need you to step out front.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I got a surprise for you too.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t come any closer for a sec. This is gonna
be kind of a shock… You remember when we said “together forever no
matter what”?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Baby, you’re scaring me.</p>
<p><strong>him for the first time</strong>: he’s HUGE, easily twice the
size he once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE
BODY.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh my G-g-g. What did you…do to Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Deb, it’s me. It’s still me.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Don’t…don’t…DON’T TOUCH ME!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I love you, Deb.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.
And keep it quiet. I don’t need this to hit the press.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes sir. You’ve got the Mayor at eight,
then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Front page?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Top left, like you asked. Today Wall
Street. Tomorrow, who knows…maybe Washington.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Leonard. Think bigger.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A few days in space, it’ll be great, what’s the
worst that could happen?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Perfect. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think you got trouble? Take a good look,
pal, how bad could it be?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, easy there, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You had to choose my spot, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is really not my day.</p>
<p><strong>cars screech, swerve, slamming into each other, causing
a</strong>: FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT! Windows shatter, fires flicker.
One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER. COPS clamber out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A little help here?! You wanna hit that button,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not even Ben deserves that.</p>
<p><strong>bridge cop</strong>: Back! We’re evac-ing the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What now? Reed…? What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben’s out there. Let’s go get him.</p>
<p><strong>bridge cop</strong>: Maybe you didn’t hear me. Those cars are
gonna blow sky high, any second.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Look, we’ve got a friend out there in trouble.
We need to get to him before –</p>
<p><strong>bridge cop #2</strong>: Nobody gets past this point.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We need to get past them.</p>
<p><strong>bridge cop #1</strong>: What the hell is this? A magic
show?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What…? Oh.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This is wrong in so many ways.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You’ve been working out.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Any more ideas, Reed? Maybe you should strip
down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh, Sue?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh. Well then…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m gonna need serious therapy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the –!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Or this?! What the hell am I? ’Cause I sure
ain’t Ben anymore.</p>
<p><strong>the back of the truck dangles out, hundreds of feet above
the</strong>: WATER! FIREMEN hang off the back and sides. The truck
TEETERS, falling! Ben wastes no time. He GRABS onto the front of the
truck, just as it goes off the side!</p>
<p><strong>on the dangling firetruck</strong>: FIREMEN climb out,
clawing toward the bridge. Their truck SWINGS. Bits and pieces tumble
down at them – a hose, an axe, a helmet. All deadly now. The HANGING
LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I swear to you, I will do everything in my
power until there is not a breath left in me: you are going to be Ben
again.</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the
new Fantastic Four. For the first time they strike a heroic pose.
Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Uh, sir…Larry King called, to cancel.
Apparently, there’s a bigger story.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: There’s some folks outside, want to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re not going public with this. We’re
scientists, not celebrities.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: Too late, son.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: That’s what they’re calling you. The
Fantastic Four.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny, slow down. Let’s think this through, a
second.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Okay. Done thinking.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: So which one of you’s the leader?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’d be me.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: No seriously.</p>
<p><strong>chief fireman</strong>: You’re on, son. They all want a
statement.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh, during our recent mission to the Von Doom
space station, we were exposed to as yet-unidentified radioactive
energy, most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun–</p>
<p><strong>various reporters</strong>: What happened on the bridge? Does
it hurt to stretch? Were you really on fire? Is it true that one of you
can fly?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Working on it. And it’s a lot harder –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We don’t know much more than you do, at this
point. Which is why we will be going directly to the lab, where we can
diagnose our symptoms and –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Symptoms? So it’s like a disease?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Symptoms? Please. If having powers is a
disease, then yeah we got it. And we are gonna blow your minds. There’s
a new day dawning. The day of the Fantastic Four.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: That thing doesn’t look too
fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who’s
been through a terrible orde–</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What he’s trying to say is: every team needs
a mascot…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Look, we went up to space to find a way to
understand DNA, to cure disease, save lives. Well, now it’s our DNA, our
disease, our lives on the line… Thank you. No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Be nice.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Well, Victor, the bank would like to
congratulate you. On the fastest freefall since the Depression. We can’t
even give your stock away.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ned, you know I can turn this around.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: You promised a cure-all, and came back
with this. Who the hell’s going to invest in a biotech company that
turns its workers into circus freaks?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I really appreciate all your support.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: You’ve got a week, Victor. One week to
turn this around. Or we pull out… This meeting is over.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Goddamn book-keeper doesn’t know preferred
stock from livestock.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sir. Reed’s comments at that press
conference killed us. How are we going to turn this around?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Very simple. I cure them. If I can cure
these freaks, then I can cure anyone. What better way to restore my
reputation?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Smile, Ben. They want to like you. Give ’em
your good side. Or your less bad side.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Uh…don’t do drugs.</p>
<p><strong>o’hoolihan</strong>: Welcome back to the Baxter,
Dr. Richards. All that for you?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m afraid so…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Jimmy. Good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>o’hoolihan</strong>: Good to see you too… Don’t worry, sir. I
know how crowded that head of yours is.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Any visitors while I was away?</p>
<p><strong>o’hoolihan</strong>: Just the usual. Told ’em you were
circling round outer space.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We had a tough year.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, nine years straight.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot
taller.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh, it is.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Either we’re moving really fast…or not at
all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll take the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: How come Ben can’t turn it on and off like
us?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: That’s what we’re here to find out.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: If it happened to him, then it could…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wait. You mean there’s chance we could be
full-on-24-7-fantastic?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire
for the rest of your life?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Is that a trick question? C’mon, I can’t be
the only one who thinks this is cool.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We should stay here until we can define the
extent of our changes…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This place is deluxe. You got cable?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: …and figure out how to reverse them. Let me
show you to your rooms.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: God, I’ve been so worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, your scar –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I told you, I’m fine. It’s you I’m worried
about.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Please, no apologies. I’ve arranged for your
things to be moved to one of my condos. You’ll have round-the clock
care.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Thank you, that’s generous, but I think I
should stay here. With my brother. Until we get a handle on this.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Sue. I think you should let my doctors have
a look at you.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m starting to wonder the same thing… How
much do you know about what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Not much. We need to run tests to see the
extent of the damage.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Well, let me know if there is anything I can
do. We’re all in this together now.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor wait… I just wanted to say, I’m sorry
the mission didn’t go as planned –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Didn’t go as planned? It was a catastrophe.
You ruined the lives of four people –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to
abort –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look
like a fool –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor, if we could understand what happened
to us –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I don’t want to understand it. This isn’t
one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There a problem, Vic?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No problem, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Just pay your goddamn electric bill, and get
to work on a cure.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You got a chisel round here?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: If we’re going to identify the source of the
mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate
positional genomes.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We need to give you a physical, so we know what
got zapped.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well why didn’t you say so? You want me to lift
some weights or something?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No, just sit back. We have a good sense of
your strength from the firetruck. We need to find the source of your
strength.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How bad is it? You know I used to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, this might smart a little.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’ll…continue this later.</p>
<p><strong>inside the chamber</strong>: Johnny turns white hot, blinding
to look at: the chamber walls begin to glow red. Machines go
haywire.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Back it down, Johnny!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I can go hotter!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re really cramping my style here.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you’re
approaching supernova –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That’s the temperature of the sun.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Not only could you kill yourself, but you
could set fire to Earth’s atmosphere and destroy all human life as we
know it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He cooked the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay. I’ve uh, got some questions, from Sue.
That she thought might be better coming from me… Can you, you know, go
to the bathroom…like normal…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. You don’t wanna know the details.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, I’m afraid I’ve got to ask –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up
your –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: O-kay. We’ll skip that question.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Is there something about flames? About
flaming, that you –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What are you trying to say? Just because I
dress well and like to dance –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What? No. I’m trying to figure out why we each
ended up with different symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, well that’s easy: I’m hot. You’re…well,
you’re a little limp. Sue’s easy to see through. And Ben’s always been a
hardass. Why aren’t you writing this down?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: It’s not “invisibility” per se. You’re bending
the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That’s
what you projected on the Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What about you? You haven’t eaten in days. How
come you’re never on this side of the microscope?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Bruises…from the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Have you had any side-effects, from your
powers?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’ve had some headaches. Migraines.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You should be able to bend light around other
objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better
–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m saying, if you had a little more self
control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact
emotions when –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Anger. Rage. Frustration.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that
feeling? Some memory or…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m sure I can come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: How’s that coming – whoa –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that…
You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What in the world would give me that idea?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I mean, you broke up with me, right?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my
door. Ergo…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Reed. I was ready for the next step, you
weren’t, ergo, I walked.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I think it was a little more complicated than
–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I just wanted to share an apartment. What was
so complicated about that?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: There were a lot of variables to consider
–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No. There weren’t. There was you. And me. No
variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But
your head got in the way… like it always does.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue…I just…I thought…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Same old Reed. Too much thinking…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Okay guys, we have a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like
us. So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on
demand or remaining impervious to flame.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at
themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms. No boots, no gloves. Not
yet. .</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You look like an eighties rock band.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: The suit will stretch. You should try it –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wouldn’t be caught dead in that.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s right. These costumes are… missing
something. I can’t put my finger on it –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: They’re not costumes.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We’re not taking them out. Johnny, we need to
stay here till we’ve stabilized.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m getting sick of being trapped here. NASA
wasn’t even this strict!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe it’s missing a utility belt.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So what’s the prognosis?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: an X-RAY. Victor’s ARM. The metallic
transformation is higher now. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor and his
DOCTOR. In the wall behind them: ancient armor . It adds a little menace
to the room.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Your tissue, your organs, your entire
biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning,
somehow –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And they’re changing into…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I don’t really know. A compound
organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder
than diamonds –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Like the shields Reed said would protect us.
How long?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: At this rate, the infection should be
complete in two, maybe three weeks –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What do you mean “complete”?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I wish I could tell you. I can’t pretend to
know what we’re dealing with here. I’ll notify the CDC and –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The Center for Disease Control. If this
thing is contagious –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Look at me. I have a life. I’m the face of a
billion-dollar-company… We need to keep this confidential,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: But…this disease…is progressive…
degenerative…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That’s terrible news…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …but I think I’ll get a second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>a series of time-lapse shots</strong>: REED works around the
Baxter Building, spending hours searching for the cure. He checks
charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Nothing…nothing…nothing…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Of course…of course…the cloud…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The plants, from space. Their particles are
still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create
the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: If we can build a machine to re-create the
storm, we can reverse the polarity –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: And reverse the mutations –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Curing countless diseases, not just ours.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: But we’re the focus, right Reed? Reed…?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Of course. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: And you sure you can control this thing? Last
time didn’t work out so well.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: With the right energy, we can stabilize the
storm. Maybe tie into the city grid…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You really need to get a janitor.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: This must be what it looks like inside your
head.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: There’s a system to it.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Wait! Sue, don’t touch tha–</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Sorry. My fault. I won’t…touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Is Reed any closer to a cure?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The only thing he’s closer to is Sue…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Make me a reservation for two at Cipriani
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And get this over to Ben Grimm.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Close your eyes, baby. Keep ’em
closed.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You surprised?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah I’m surprised. Surprised the fire
department didn’t shut this down.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: the handheld camera whips around,
revealing…a SURPRISE PARTY. Full of people. Ben Grimm is a popular guy.
On screen: Reed hugs Ben. They pose for pictures together.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: God. I was good looking.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What did you wish for, honey?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I already got it. Everything I want.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Damn, Stretch!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How far’s that rubber bend?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to calculate. And it’s
not rubber. It’s muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to
manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute
my density to –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Right, whatever, have fun.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Hey, that’s Ben Grimm there, the first mook
from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ernie. Sorry for killing your business. I’ll
take the usual, then I’m out… Better make it a double.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Who killed the party?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Make it a triple. On the house, Benny.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If there’s a God, she hates me.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: I don’t think She’s real big on hate.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You wouldn’t say that, if you could see me.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Can I…? See you…?</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: It’s okay, I won’t bite… …not that I
could.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Such a sad face… You know, sometimes being
different isn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Trust me, this ain’t one of those times.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: See you round, Benny…</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: I’m Alicia, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Thank you for coming out to see me.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You said it was urgent.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It is. There’s something we need to talk
about. Something I need to ask you…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to
know I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but I just don’t –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Susan. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You think I brought you here to talk about
us? Please. This is business. I need to know: how close is Reed to
finding to a cure?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He’s working round the clock. But the data
needs to be tested, analyzed before –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Same old Reed. All analysis, no action.
Wasn’t that the problem with you two?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: If these molecules aren’t stable, they could
make us worse, maybe even kill us.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he
likes having his prize specimen under glass… It’s ironic, isn’t it?
You’re finally the perfect woman for him…because you’re his science
project.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Please don’t make this personal –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh, I think you already have.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, we can’t do anything until the research
is ready.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: “We,” huh?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Don’t forget who you work for, Susan. So get
to work. And do your job.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I wish my wife would disappear.</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: And now, ladies and gentlemen, we
have a special guest for you… Johnny Storm of the Fantastic Four!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, Ronnie Renner! I’m a big fan.</p>
<p><strong>kenny bartram</strong>: Heard you like to ride. Wanna take
her for a spin?</p>
<p><strong>ronnie renner</strong>: Come on, bro. I’ll teach you some
tricks…if you can keep up.</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: A rock-solid double-flip!</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: Look at that lift, ladies and
gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: Frontside 360! He’s totally flat
and whipped!</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: Whoa! That’s a…what is that? A
720?</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: He’s going for a Kiss of
Death!</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: Is he……flying?</p>
<p><strong>x games announcer</strong>: Unbelievable, ladies and
gentlemen! You’ve just seen the first…the first…TORCHFLIGHT! The
McTORCH!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: My bad. Sorry about that. Thanks for the
lesson, bro.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That’s new…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Have you read these…? From all over. People
want us to fight crimes… save their kids…solve their problems… …when we
can’t even solve our own.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Reed. How close are we to a cure?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No way to know. Without more tests,
experiments.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We’re not specimens, we’re patients. This isn’t
just another science project to you, is it…?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: BEN! What? What’s going on!?</p>
<p><strong>x games reporter</strong>: So what can you tell us about the
outfit?</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.
He is peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit, revealing
his FF UNIFORM, with a “4” STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not too much, but I will say that it’s all
weather and no leather. Kind of Armani meets Astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, he did.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What did he do to the uniform?!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He talked me into it.</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: So what are your superhero
names?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I go by the Human Torch. The ladies call me
Torch.</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: What about the rest of the
team?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl…the
Invisible Girl.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Girl…?!</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: That’s easy to remember. And Reed
Richards? He’s the leader. So what’s he? Mr. Fantastic?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t say he’s the leader.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Could be worse.</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: What about this one? What do you
call this Thing?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’s it. Just The Thing. We would have
gone with The Rock, but it was taken. And “Thing” pretty much sums it
up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay. I’m gonna go kill him now.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben! Slow down a second and –</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: Is it true what they say? That he
can expand any part of his anatomy?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Actually, between us, I think he’s got some
problems staying rigid.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: …wait for me…</p>
<p><strong>x-games reporter</strong>: Which may explain why this woman’s
not smiling.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Dude. That’s my sister.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Where’s my ride?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What the?! Is that my –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
What?!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You gave us names? What are you, the “face” of
the Fantastic Four now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s about to be a broken face.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: This isn’t permanent, Johnny. We need to be
careful until we’re normal again.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What if some of us don’t want to be “normal”
again? We didn’t all turn into monsters like –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you just –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, that’s it, tinkerbell! You want to fly?
Fly.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s see if we can get blood from a
stone.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You two need a time-out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Blockhead started it!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Damn it, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You need to control yourself and think before
you –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got
these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know…like,
calling?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: A higher calling like getting girls and making
money?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Is there any higher?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This is who we are Reed. Accept it. Or
better yet: enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben! Slow down…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He didn’t mean it. You know Johnny. He’s always
been a hothead –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not him. It’s them. I can’t live like
this.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Just give Reed a little more time. You know how
he works – analyzing every little step before he takes one –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s easy for you to be patient.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, it’s not. I thought I was done waiting for
Reed… We’re all in this together now, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Together? Look at me, Susie. You got no idea
what I’d give…to be invisible. Your nightmare…is my dream.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: This is how you “turn things around”?
These freaks are on the front page and your company’s in the
obituaries.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I have a plan to use their publicity for
–</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Victor, stop. The bank’s lost enough
already. This isn’t a negotiation. It’s a notification. We’re pulling
out.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You need to look long-term here. Without
risk, there’s no –</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Reward. We all know the sales pitch, Vic.
And frankly, we’re done buying… Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Von Doom? Gave me a little shock. No hard
feelings, right? Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: You know, you could always move back to
Latvura, start fresh.</p>
<p><strong>ned cecil</strong>: Maybe that’s where you belong, back in
the “old country.”</p>
<p><strong>electric currents race across the ground,
slithering</strong>: LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER , heading straight
for Ned. His eyes go wide. And…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s pronounced Latveria. This meeting’s
over, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …the Fantastic Four put on quite a show
last night. They landed in every major headline in the northern
hemisphere. In related news…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
Industries may be filing for bankruptcy. You may remember that it was
Victor Von Doom who…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sir, is everything okay? What happened to
your…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed… He got what he wanted… Everything he
wanted…he took from me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Now I’m going to take it back. Piece by
bloody piece…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor, are you…are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Don’t worry about me. Worry about
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What I should have done a long time ago.
Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: But I’m not done with the machine –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Which is precisely the point. Analysis is
over. It’s time for action. My men could have mass- produced this by
now.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Mass-produced? This isn’t a toaster. You have
no idea how it works.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Re-create the storm, invert the polarity
here, reverse the mutation there. Don’t talk to me like I’m some
schoolboy. I’ve got the same Phd you do.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The storm needs to be handled exactly right,
or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill
us…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor, please. We need time to verify the
data… We can’t afford any mistakes – there’s only enough ions for two or
three attempts.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Reed. I’m not asking permission. We’ll build
it, while you check the specs.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Don’t let Victor push you into making a mistake
–</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He was going to take away all my data,
equipment –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Better than your life. Victor’s not the one who
has to get into that thing. We are.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Which is why I’m working twenty hours a day,
checking every variable –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Every variable but yourself. You don’t eat,
sleep. You can’t live in your head like –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m not the only one in there. I got you, Vic,
Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: So clear it out. Get out of your head. Get out
of here…</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Mister, Mister! Please help me! My
kitty is stuck in a tree.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Please save Miss Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Eyebrows are a little big…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I figured the only way to get you here was to
stick that in the window.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How’d you know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: I’m blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not really dressed for a party.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Relax, it’s casual.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I mean…I’m a little…dusty…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Those yours too?</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: My step-dad’s. I’m strictly into stone. I
was wondering when you’d walk by.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: You know, you could’a run an ad in the
personals.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: “Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.”</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: This ain’t permanent. My friend Reed’s
working on a cure…I think.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Bennie. You feel pretty good as is.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: You don’t know what it’s like out there.
Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring,
whispering –</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: I wouldn’t know anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how
many astronauts did you know? You went your own way then. You didn’t
listen to people. So why start now…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Need a ride, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: A few fans. Hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Gotta take care of the fans, right?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Look, I built my business knowing what
people want. And right now, the people want you.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: And we don’t want to let the people down
now, do we?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Videogames? You serious?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You talk to Reed and Sue about this?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Johnny. Let’s be honest here. Ben, Reed,
Sue. Good people, all. But stars? I don’t want to break up the band, but
you’re the one they want. Don’t you think it’s time to go solo…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Take the car for a spin. Think about it. Is
this the life you want? Or would you rather live in Reed’s lab…?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter’s main
power to generate enough voltage –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Remember our first date here…? God, I was so
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You were?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Of course I was. I’d read all your papers on
bioethics. Some of them two times just so I’d have something to say to
you.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks
to keep it open late?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I gave him twenty.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I didn’t want that night to end.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue, you were right. It wasn’t complicated. I
just wasn’t ready to be…to become… You can be a little intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You always talked about how you liked the kind
of man who could approach you…speak his mind. One who wasn’t afraid to
tell you what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I did. I did, Reed…but I wanted you to be that
man.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside
your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Why didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And
Reed… I’m saying it now.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Come find me.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That’s my nose, genius… These are my lips.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Look around. I’ll get us drinks. They always
let blind girls cut the line.</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: I don’t know about this one. It lacks a
certain…realism.</p>
<p><strong>bohemian girl #1</strong>: She’s always had a thing for
runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>bohemian girl #2</strong>: I know. Did she really think these
sculptures would sell?</p>
<p><strong>bohemian girl #1</strong>: Like anybody would want this thing
in their house. That girl’s a one-woman charity.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: About me? How sweet.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Come on. Let me buy you something to eat.
Looks like you could use the company.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: ’Scuse me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I know it can’t be easy. Life hasn’t changed
that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public.
But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back…</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: If you’re trying to cheer me up you’re
doing a helluva job –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m just saying, I know what it’s like to
lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it’s never coming
back.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: Reed’s gonna fix me up –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: For your sake I hope you’re right. I’m sorry
if that sounds a little skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>the thing</strong>: Skeptical…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Look, he’s a brilliant man, we should trust
he’s working as hard as he can. You’re his best friend. So what possible
reason could he have for taking his time? I mean, other than getting
close to Sue?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, I have that effect on people.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to
remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: We’re working as hard as we can –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Come on, this is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Glad “nothing” could take you away from your
work.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, I don’t know if this thing’ll change us
back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while
longe–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look at me, Reed. Look at me!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I am looking. That’s why I can’t make a
mistake! I’ve got to get it right, and it’s not right yet! We need to
test this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I spent my whole life protecting you, from the
schoolyard to the stars. For what? So you could play Twister with your
girlfriend while I’m the freak of the week?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben! Stop it! Or I’ll stop it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stay out of this Susie.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good thing you’re flexible enough to watch your
own back. ’Cause you’re on your own now.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I’m OK. Just go, go after him. Stop him.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Christmas come early! Check it out!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey! That’s a prototype!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny? Did you see Ben?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I’m done
with this freak show. I’m moving back to the real world.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Is that what you call it? “Real”?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: At least it beats living in a lab like
somebody’s science project.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn’t
raise us to –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Look around, sis! She’s not here. So you can
stop talking to me like I’m your little boy –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on,
you’re smarter than this. You think those people out there care about
you? You’re just a fad to them.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s try something new: you live your life.
And I’ll live mine. And just for the record: they LOVE me.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh god, Reed.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What did you do, Reed? What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I can…make it work.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Reed, stop, you need to rest your –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: The power…I need…more power…to control…the
storm –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: More power…?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Leonard. Bring me our lab rat.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Ben! They need you back at the Baxter
building. It’s…Reed.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What do you say we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Is that all you do? Bar tricks and
stealing chicks…</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: What are you doing?! You could have
burned somebody!</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: You know, if I had your power I’d be
doing something with it, not wasting my time doing cheap bar tricks,
hitting on some other guy’s girl.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ben, come in.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What is this? Where’s Reed?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Where do you think? With Sue.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ll take it from here, Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you want, Vic?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: To help you. I’ve run every test known to
man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Reed said it’d be weeks till –</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: He also said we’d avoid that storm in space.
And we know how that turned out.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: He couldn’t generate enough power for the
machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for
“Mr. Fantastic.”</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you can? Power it up?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes. I’ve found a new energy source.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Tell me…do you want to be Ben Grimm
again?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>from the controls</strong>: Victor initiates the
transformation sequence. As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
the lab. Energy pumps into the chamber. The storm swirls faster. Lights
flicker…there’s not enough power, until –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh my God… Th-thank you. THANK</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Vic… What the…?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Everyone thought I was safe behind those
shields…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Victor, the machine worked for me. It can work
for you –</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: It did, Ben. It worked perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You planned this…?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: I’ve always wanted power. Now I’ve got an
unlimited supply…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And no Thing to stand in your way.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Take a good look, Ben. This is what a man
looks like who embraces his destiny.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: One down, three to go.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Right on cue.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh god Ben. Are you okay? You did it, you
really did it…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No, Reed. I did.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor…? What, what happened to you? What did
you do to your –</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Exactly what I said I would: I built a better,
stronger being. And outsmarted the great Reed Richards –</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Victor, this isn’t the way to –</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You always know best. So tell me. What happens
when you superheat rubber?</p>
<p><strong>o’hoolihan</strong>: Mr. Von Doom? Are you oka–</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Never better, Jimmy. And it’s Doctor Doom
now.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Why the long face?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben?!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sue!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m sorry, sis, for leaving you guys –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, I’m sorry, for pushing you out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Jesus, Ben! I go away, look what happens.
You got a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The machine works. And Vic’s gone Mister Hyde
on us –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw
that one coming.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Where is Reed?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Victor must’ve taken him.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Chemistry 101, Part Two. What happens to
rubber when it’s super- cooled?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Painful…?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: You don’t know the meaning of the word.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: But you will.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Flame off.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Great. Heat-seeker.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What are you doing –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sis. Let me take care of you for once.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: But Johnny…you can’t fly.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well then this’ll be one hell of a
basejump.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on…come on…come on…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We need to help Reed –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to
stay here. It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What…what have I done?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What has he done to you?</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: How romantic.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor, please –</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: It’s Doctor Doom to you.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We know the machine works. It worked on Ben,
it’ll work on you. We can turn you back –</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Do you really think fate turned us into gods
so we could refuse these gifts?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Victor. You always thought you were god.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Sue please, let’s not fight.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, Victor… Let’s.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Susan…… You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Marco…</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Polo.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: One more down. Now it’s just the scientist and
his specimen.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue. The only thing I ever knew without
thinking was… I…love…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Me too, Reed.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: And so four became none. It’s my time now.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Actually, Vic…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Damn, I’ve been wanting to do that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Victor’s “not that bad,” huh? Just “a little
larger than life”? Maybe you’ll listen to me next time before –</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: Doom and Ben LAND HARD. Their combined
weight CRACKS the floor of the pool. A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
through his MASK. Doom and Ben square off, but…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me, Maam. Can I borrow your car?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: The clutch sticks a little.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not gonna be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: And you can’t stop me.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Hello Susan.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: What is this? The pitiful three?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Had a little relapse, huh?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: This is going to be fun.</p>
<p><strong>on the street</strong>: Reed finally grabs both ends of the
wire.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Can’t…hold…on…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Johnny. SUPERNOVA.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: But all these people…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>thing</strong>: Flame on, kid.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
frustration –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I’m sure I can come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: Is that the best you can do…? A little
heat…?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what
happens when you supercool hot metal…? Ben…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Got it, teach.</p>
<p><strong>doom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Damn, I love this job.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Job, huh…?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Well, we do have the suits…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You know, about what we said up there, I think
maybe –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Funny how things turn out, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Dude, that’s still my sister.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Ben, I’ve been crunching the numbers on the
machine. I think if we can rework the power settings…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Forget it, egghead. I’m good as is.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: That’s my Benny.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: We’re going to have to work on your
touch.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I like the sound of that.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Sue, can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I found a broken gasket, from space –</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: A gasket? Reed, we’re at a party.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: If one of us were to wear it…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Reed. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No more thinking, no more variables… Sue
Storm…will you… Sue? Sue? You there?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: That’s my nose, genius… These are my lips.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: the party applauds. Ben, Johnny, and Alicia
move through the crowd to join Reed and Sue. As they go –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No more cracks about how I look.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, I’m Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way,
wide load coming through.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Showoff.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the MELTED FACE of DOOM. He is placed in a
wooden crate. LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his cell.</p>
