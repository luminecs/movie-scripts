<p><strong>finn</strong>: Get a move on, man!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Now you’ve deigned to arrive, Mr. Fiddler,
we can begin.</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Melanie!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Physically, I’ve reached my peak. From now
on, I can only deteriorate.</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Melanie! Dinner’s ready!</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Melanie! Your dinner’s getting cold!
Whatever are you up to!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Sorry, I’m coming - sorry!</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: I thought your dad was supposed to be a
writer, but he hasn’t written much here.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Let me see!</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Melanie! Manners!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: ‘Have ploughed the stormy seas -’</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: Storms?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Very rough weather, good to be back on
terra firma.’</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: ‘The New York lecture went quite well, now
on to Chicago. Daddy. P.S. Be good chicks and lots of love, Mummy.’ Do
you want the card, Jonathon?</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: Wrong sort of boat. Almost as bad as an
aeroplane.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: They’re going to fly everywhere. Mean
things. They should have taken us.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: We’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m not too young. Juliet was my age.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: Juliet who?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: In the play. She was married, by my age.
And Mummy. Mummy wasn’t much older than me when she got married. Well,
not <i>that</i> much older.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Drat and bother and drat, drat, drat and
bother and drat…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Aagh!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Don’t fall in the pond is all I ask,
Jonathon, dear. We’ll give Madam one last chance. Melanie! Victoria and
I are going to the village! If you want breakfast, you get it for
yourself! And clear up after you!</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: You be a good girl, Victoria, and don’t
stir out of that kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Are you in there? Melanie?</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: You poor things. All on your own.</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: Families should stick together. Your
uncle and his missus are going to look after you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We didn’t even know Uncle Philip got
married. Mummy never said. He didn’t like Daddy. He never visited.</p>
<p><strong>mrs rundle</strong>: You look after your sister,
Victoria.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: If they’d stayed on the boat, none of this
would have happened.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: There, now …</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: You’ll be Miss Melanie.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I thought our uncle was coming to meet
us.</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: I’ll get your bags.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He was called away suddenly on business and
sent us in his place, even going so far as to give us the necessary taxi
fare, an unaccustomed attack of generosity on his part.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You’ll need to know who we are, we’re the
brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way,
your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: But you’re Irish!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: There’s no law, as I know of, to prevent
it.</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: As yet.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Toys!</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Are you our Auntie? What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: Didn’t they tell you your Auntie Margaret
was dumb?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: That’s a stylish craft.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: I made it from a kit.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Did you now?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: We’ll get your things upstairs, settle you
in.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Uncle Philip isn’t back yet.</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: One thing at a time.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: In daytime you can see St Paul’s.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: It’s like a crow’s nest.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You’ll put your clothes here.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: There’s no mirror.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: There’s not.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: He’s a pyjama case, really.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Do you know you’ve lovely hair, even if you
torment it in those braids.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I like plaits.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You’re spoiling your pretty looks. Come
here.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Don’t you ever wash your neck?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Give me your comb.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: She ought to be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You’re the early bird! After the late night
you had.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Curled up on the landing like love locked
out!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I did like the music.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I carried you up to your bed.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Oh no, no, no! You must go and change your
clothes. Now, this minute.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He can’t abide a woman in trousers. He says a
woman in trousers is a sin against nature.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: A sin against <i>what?</i></p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Slip up and change into a skirt, else he’ll
create something terrible. Don’t you want to make a good impression on
your first day?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Is there anything else I should know about
him?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Speak when you’re spoken to. He likes his
women quiet.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I see you’ve plaited your hair again.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I saw his teeth in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He can take out his smile and keep it on a
shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn’t that so, old
fellow?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went
to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: She got away.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He made that. In his off hours.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: It’s as though he’d trapped a real cuckoo
inside.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Didn’t you know he made things?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He’s forced to sell the toys, to feed us all.
But he keeps the other stuff to entertain himself.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Come and see.</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Gooday! Gooday!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Gooday to you, you old bugger.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I’m the sorcerer’s apprentice in this
establishment.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I paint the feathers and the fur and the skin
but Himself breathes the life in.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome
to Flower’s Marionette Microcosm.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Don’t fret. It’s only his dream. Dreams aren’t
catching, not like measles.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I didn’t know about the puppets. It’s a lot
to take in, all at once.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Home is where the heart is.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I can’t go home because there’s no home
left.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Shift yourself, girlie!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Improperly dressed, young Finn.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m Melanie.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You’re late for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: This morning’s plan of action, is as
follows: the big girl to stay with her auntie in the shop, to learn the
price of things and where they’re kept, the child to stay with them and
occupy herself whilst getting into as little trouble as possible and
-</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: May I go and work on my boat, please?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: That’s plastic. You made it from a kit. Not
your own creation. Try harder.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: He’ll come with me. See how a real craftsman
works. Downstairs in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: He didn’t ask our names.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He knows your names.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: She’s not accustomed to being ignored.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: She’ll have to learn.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What about school?</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: Too late in the term to start.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Come here, young feller.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Ever seen one of these?</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Sir is it? Mark that, young Finn. Here -</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Here’s a bit of wood. Try it!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: There. See? Wood’s got life in it. Not like
plastic.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Butterfingers. Wood’s got life in it.
Look.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Gosh!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: It’s a fair price for the work. A man must
charge a fair price. That’s economics.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: And you be careful with them things. They’re
your bread and butter now.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Victoria -</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What? Did you let that child play with one
of my toys? I don’t like children playing with my toys. Have to fix you
up with another hammer, won’t we. Give her a saucepan to play with,
that’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Auntie undress me!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I didn’t think London would be like
this.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: A hundred years ago, the Queen of England
threw a big party and everyone who was still there at cockcrow turned to
stone.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Now she’s the Queen of the Waste Land.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: She’s a fallen woman, poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: What was <i>that</i> in aid of?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Get away from me…</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You don’t know the way home!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Damn … damn …</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Do you think he did it right, Edward Bear?
Do you think he knows … how to do it?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Tonight we celebrate the grand opening of
the winter season of Flower’s Marionette Microcosm. We present an
original drama entitled ‘An Artist’s Passion’.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Why hasn’t the lady got any eyes?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: The creator adds the last vital tints to his
masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: How can the Artist transmit life to that
which is his own Creation and expresses the very depth of his being?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: The Artist offers his creation his heart,
his hand, his very being.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Each man kills the thing he loves.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Whoops!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Won’t use him to work the puppets again.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I’ll use you instead of a puppet, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: After all, why shouldn’t the girl do
something for her keep. God knows she eats enough. She’s not too big,
she won’t be out of scale. That’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Ain’t you having a bite more to eat,
Margaret?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Pour us more tea, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Live with the Irish; live like pigs.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Tut, tut.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Put it in the window. It ought to fetch at
least ten guineas.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: I’m earning my keep, sir!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Not yet, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: Uncle Philip wants Melanie downstairs
straightaway.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Can I keep my shoes on? I’ll need my coat
to go downstairs, it’s freezing away from the fire -</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Take off that wrap.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You’re well built; how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda
and the swan. See?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Big swan, little Leda. But you’re a big
girl. Do you have periods?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: What’s that to do with swans?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Keep your mouth shut, Finn. I’ll talk to her
how I please.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I can say what I like.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Oh no you can’t. Get on with the
painting.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: It’s all right, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I suppose you’ll do. Turn round. Smile. Not
like that. Show your teeth. You’ve got a bit of a look of your mother.
None of your father, thank God. Should have seen his face when I turned
up at the wedding. Thought I’d come to drag her away with me. But I knew
she was gone for good. You’ve got a fair bit of your mother in you,
though.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Walk up and down.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Not very graceful, are you. Finn O’Connor!
Teach her how to shift herself. You used to fancy yourself at the light
fantastic. Get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Not down here. You’ll spoil the set.
Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: We brought them with us from over the sea.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: That’s your beach. This is the story. Leda
walks by the shore, gathering shells. Night comes on. She hears the
beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away
but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece.
Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: That won’t do. Make it flow.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: That’s a bit better. Now do it again. I’ll be
the swan.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Swish, swish, that’s the beating of my wings.
When you hear that, you put a spurt on.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He’ll turn you out if you don’t do what he
wants, Melanie! You run, you stumble and I bear you to the ground with
my enormous pinions.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Finn, there’s a splinter in your left foot.
If you don’t let me take the splinter out, it will fester.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What did I do wrong?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I won’t do it because he wants me to do it,
even if I want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Do what? Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: You’re only a young thing.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’re not so old yourself!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Living with him put years on me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Wishful thinking.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You never finished it.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: That was wishful thinking, too.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: All the same, I’d like to keep it … in my
room … if you don’t mind … There aren’t any mirrors in the house.</p>
<p><strong>first child</strong>: Penny for the guy, guv -</p>
<p><strong>second child</strong>: Mean bastard.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Music!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Get started!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: ‘Leda gathers shells by the shore in
approaching dusk. Little does she know that Almighty Jove has picked her
out to be his mate.’</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: ‘The sound of thunder announces the presence
of the majestic visitant.’</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: ‘Leda attempts to flee her heavenly suitor
but his beauty and majesty bear her to the ground.’</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: ‘The innocent girl’s thighs tremble. Her
loins melt. She falls.’</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: ‘Almighty Jove in the form of a swan wreaks
his will.’</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: I didn’t like that play.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: The door’s not locked.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Can I come into bed with you for a little
while, I feel terrible.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Well … yes. All right. But -</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Ah, come on now!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Would you mind holding me in your arms for a
little while?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Finn -</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you
been?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I finished it off.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I chopped it into little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: He’ll murder you when he finds out.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: He’ll be looking for another apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I hope he doesn’t pick on Jonathon.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Can you move over a wee bit?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: The swan was so ridiculous. All the same,
it did scare me.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I’ve got a present for you…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Finn …</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: In my pocket.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: It’s a swan’s egg.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I think you should go, now, Jonathon.</p>
<p><strong>jonathon</strong>: What do you mean? Run away to sea?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Philip’s gone and taken his teeth with
him.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Reprieve.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I know for a fact he didn’t take Jonathon.
Jonathon went off by himself.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: Dammit, I’m going to sit in his chair. Don’t
fret, it can’t swallow me up.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I am seized with a great and glorious notion.
Let’s make today a holiday. Himself being absent. And the swan
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: He chopped it up.</p>
<p><strong>finn</strong>: I shifted it out there. On the bonfire.
Tonight it will burn.</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: You mad bugger.</p>
<p><strong>francie</strong>: He chopped it up!</p>
