<p><strong>frank</strong>: So, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m studying to be an actress. You?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m a longshoreman.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No, I mean really.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean really too. Starting Monday, though,
I’m doing something a little more glamorous. Night cashier at a
cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I don’t mean how you make money. I mean what
are you interested in?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Honey - if I had the answer to that one, I
bet I’d bore us both to death in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Thank God that’s over…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …And she was very disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Frank! Very nice Frank!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks, Mrs. Givings.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I can’t tell you how much we enjoyed
it. You have a very talented wife.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll pass it along!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Frank!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: She’s through there…! You `bout ready for
that drink?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Couple of minutes!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April, sweetheart. You were great. I mean
it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hi. You about ready to leave? I’ve just got
to get this makeup off, then we can go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well… I guess it wasn’t a triumph or
anything, was it?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I guess not. I’ll be ready in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Will you do me a favor? Milly and Shep wanted
us to go out with them afterwards. Will you say we can’t? Say it’s
because of the baby sitter or something?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, the thing is, I already said that we
could. I mean, I just saw them out there and I said we would.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh. Then would you mind going out again and
saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you think that’s a little bit rude,
April?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well I’ll tell them myself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I’ll tell them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean it, baby. You were the only person in
that play.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We just never should’ve let you get mixed up
in the damned thing.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ve studied for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Could we sort of stop talking about it
now?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure. I just don’t want you feeling bad about
it, that’s all. Because it’s not worth it. I mean, it’s bad enough
having to live out here among these damn people - what’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just
stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What are you doing? Why are we stopping?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No, Frank, please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Baby, it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Please don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Why can’t you…just… LEAVE ME</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It strikes me, that there’s a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here…. And there’s one or two things I’d
like to clear up. Number one, it’s not my fault the play was lousy.
Number two, it’s sure as hell not my fault you didn’t turn out to be an
actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the
better off we’ll both be. Number three, I don’t happen to fit the role
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you’ve been trying to hang that
one on me ever since we moved here. Number four -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Come back to the
car.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No. Just let me stand here a second.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, can’t we sit in the car and talk about
it, instead of running all over Route Twelve?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Haven’t I made it clear I don’t particularly
want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. Jesus, I’m trying to be nice about this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: How kind of you. How terribly, terribly kind
of you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a minute. I don’t deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You’re always so wonderfully definite, aren’t
you, on the subject of what you do and don’t deserve?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wait a minute, God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You listen to me. This is one time you’re not
going to get away with twisting everything I say.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Christ, I wish you’d stayed home tonight!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what you are when you’re like this?
You’re sick. I really mean that. You’re sick!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And you know what you are? You’re
disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Just because you’ve got me safely in this
little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you
want!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You in a trap! You in a trap! Jesus, don’t
make me laugh!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes, me. Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic
little boy �� Look at you! Look at you, and tell me how by any stretch
of the imagination you can call yourself a man!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t look at me like that, April.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Could we please go home now?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m going to need your help this morning, Old
Scout.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For the next few hours, you’re to warn me of
Bandy’s every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in
the likely event I that I throw up. It’s that bad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good morning, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing good about it, I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Of course, I knew the moment you came
off the train what you were looking for… A small remodeled barn, or a
carriage house � And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of
thing just isn’t available anymore… But I don’t want you to despair.
There is one place down here I want to show you… Now of course it isn’t
very desirable at this end. As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these
little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places � plumbers, carpenters,
little local people of that sort.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: But eventually… Eventually it leads up
to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to
show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple,
clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It’s right around this
next curve… Now, you’ll see it � there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: See the little white one? Sweet isn’t
it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope? Charming, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>bandy</strong>: Came for you from Toledo this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bandy</strong>: This is the third one this month.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, right, sorry. I thought I’d taken care of
that…</p>
<p><strong>bandy</strong>: I’m not prepared to have this conversation
again, Frank. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p><strong>bandy</strong>: These folks in the provinces look up to us,
Frank. We need to be efficient. We can’t have this kind of back and
forth, and so forth. It’s just not efficient. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …Absolutely, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Toledo. Branch manager wants a revised
brochure for the conference on “The Knox 500.” “It’s just not
efficient.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sounds like a real goodie.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t even know what the Knox 500 does… Do
you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t insult me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now, if you’ll look in the inactive file
under SP-1109 you’ll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency…
and that way we can trace the thing back to its original sources.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I hope you weren’t planning on an early
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I’m not really hungry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good. I’ll check on you later.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know something? You’re lucky you met
me.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Oh? How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can show you the ropes. There’s an art to
survival at Knox. Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bring me the telephone would you? And two
more martinis.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank Wheeler here.
Just wanted to let you know that I’ve had to send Maureen Grube down to
Visual Aides for me. I’ll probably need her the rest of the day… Okay?
Fine. You too.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I never even heard of Visual Aides.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s because it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Yoo-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hi Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I can’t stay a minute… My, don’t you
look comfy! I just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in
the front yard.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: All it wants is just a tiny dollop of
water for the first few days, and you’ll find it absolutely thrives.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, thank you… You want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Only if you’re having some.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Is there something I can do for you,
Helen?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh… yes, I almost forgot. I do have a
small favor I’d like to ask… It’s about my son, John. He’s been in the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Well, actually, just for the present,
he’s in Pleasant Brook… Psychiatric.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh… Nothing serious. He just got a
little run down. Things can just get the better of us sometimes. Don’t
you think?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: It really is a marvellous facility and
the treatments seem to be doing him wonders… Anyway, they said getting
out for an afternoon might do him some good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I think he finds my friends a little
conventional, frankly. I mean, he’s travelled. He has a PhD in
mathematics. I suppose you could say he’s an intellectual. It would do
him a world of good to meet a young couple like you.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’d love to Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: So, I thought perhaps if you had some
time…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Thank you, dear… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I remember when you first came off the
train. You weren’t like most of my clients. You were different,
somehow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Well, you looked simply ravishing and
I just knew Frank did something terribly brilliant in town. You just
seemed… special… Of course you still are.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I guess you got me a little drunk.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what today is?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: …Monday?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s my birthday. I’m thirty years old
today.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Happy birthday!</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: What was the name of the department you
made up again?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Visual Aides.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: …What-a-joke.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Want to hear a real joke…?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My old man worked at Knox.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once a year he
used to take me into the city for lunch. It was supposed to be a
special, life-advice sort of occasion.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not really… I used to sit there and think, `I
hope to Christ I don’t end up like you.’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And here I am, a thirty year old Knox man.
Can you beat that?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I think I kind of lost you… Your father
worked for Knox…?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I’m sorry, but everything’s kinda going out
of focus.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How `bout some air?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You ever been to Paris?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’ve never really been anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe I’ll take you with me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going back first chance I get. People are
alive there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All I know now is that I want to feel things.
Really feel them. How’s that for an ambition…?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Frank Wheeler?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mm?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I think you’re the most interesting person
I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I guess this wasn’t what you had in
mind when you went to work this morning?</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: No. It certainly wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Do you have a cigarette, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure, here.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Can I get you a drink or anything?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I guess I’d
better be cutting out, it’s getting kind of late.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Gee, that’s right. Have you missed your
train?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s all right, I’ll get the next one.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen: you were swell. Take care now.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Frank…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why are you all dressed up?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: First of all, I missed you all day and I want
to say I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the way I’ve been since that stupid
play. I’m sorry for everything and… And I love you… Now wait here till I
call you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Alright Frank! You can come in now!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Frank. I have had the most wonderful idea.
I’ve been thinking about it all day.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s all this about?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You know how much money we have saved…?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Enough to live on for six months without you
earning another dime. And with the money we could get from the house and
the car, longer than that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What we get for the house…What are you
talking about? Where are we going to live?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …Paris.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You always said it was the only place you’d
ever been that was worth living. So why don’t we go there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re serious?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes. What’s stopping us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s stopping us? Well, I can think of a
lot of things. For instance, what kind of a job could I possibly
get?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You won’t be getting any kind of job, because
I will.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t laugh – listen a minute! Have you any
idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies
in Europe? Embassies and those things.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m serious about this Frank. Do you think
I’m kidding or something?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I know, I know. I just have a couple of
questions, is all. For one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly
I’m supposed to be doing while you’re out earning all this money?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t you see that’s the whole idea? You’ll
be doing what you should’ve been allowed to do seven years ago. You’ll
have time, Frank. You’ll have time to find out what it is that you
actually want to do, and when you figure it out you’ll have the time and
the freedom to start doing it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sweetheart, it’s just not very realistic, is
all.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic.
I think it’s unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working
like a dog year after year at a job he can’t stand, coming home to a
place he can’t stand, to a wife who’s equally unable to stand the same
things.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You want to know the worst part? Our whole
existence here is based on this great premise that we’re somehow very
special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I’ve
realized…? We’re not! We’re just like everyone else. Look at us! We’ve
bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to
resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we’ve
been punishing each other for it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen: we decided to move out here. No one
ever forced me to take the job at Knox.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean who ever said I was supposed to be a
big deal, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: When I first met you, there was nothing in
the world you couldn’t do or be.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was a little wise guy with a big mouth,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You were not! How can you even say that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …All right… So, I’ll have time. And God knows
that’s appealing. It’s very appealing. And I mean, everything you say
might make a certain amount of sense, if I had some definite talent
maybe. If I were an artist or a writer.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: But Frank, listen to me: It’s what you are
that’s being stifled here. It’s what you are that’s being denied and
denied and denied in this kind of life.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t you know…?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You’re the most valuable and wonderful thing
in the world… You’re a man.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: This is our chance, Frank. This is our one
chance.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why not…? Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, Franklin. Good to see your shining face.
What’s the news?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m moving to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right. And I’m moving to Tangiers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …Intra-company letter to Toledo… Attention
B.F. Chalmers, branch manager… With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence, this is to advise that the matter has been… very
satisfactorily taken in hand, period, paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We wholly agree that the existing brochure is
unsuitable. To this end we have developed…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Speaking of Production Control…”</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Here’s the travellers checks you asked for…
and your steamer reservations… and these I’ll pass on to the embassy for
you.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And when does this noble experiment
commence?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: September. October at the outside.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I just happen to think people are better off
doing some kind of work they actually like.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Right, yes.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But… I mean, assuming there is a true vocation
waiting for you. Wouldn’t you be just as likely to discover it here as
there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No… I don’t think it’s possible to discover
anything on the fifteenth floor of the Knox building, and I don’t think
any of you do either.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This one’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …All the way to… here.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, sweetheart. It’s a big world out there
and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How far is it?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: A long way. We have to take a boat ride over
the sea to get there.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I won’t know anyone there.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I know. And neither will I. But remember when
you started school? And now look how many friends you have…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ll never guess what they eat in Paris.
You’ll never guess…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Snails.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer/michael</strong>: Snails?!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And frog’s legs!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Buddappa banh! Banh! Banh!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: You better get changed, they’ll be here
soon.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That what you’re wearing?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Don’t you like it?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: …No… No. You look great, doll. Guess I better
haul ass.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Hiya gang.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Shep?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh those look great. I’m starving!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: April, I can’t get over it - you look like
the cat who ate the canary! Do you have something to tell us? A little
bit of news?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Not to pry or anything.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: I’m not prying. Am I prying? I didn’t mean
to.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Actually, we have got some pretty important
news.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You want to tell `em?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’re going to Europe. To Paris… To live.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: September.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: But what for?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What for? Because we’ve always wanted to.
Because the kids are still young. Because it’s beautiful. Shep, you tell
her.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: …It’s a great city.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: When did you make this decision?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh… about a week ago… its hard to remember.
We just suddenly decided to go, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: About a week ago, and you tell us now!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We had to get used to the idea.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So, what’s the deal, Frank? You get a job over
there, or what?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What do you mean, `not exactly?’</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Frank won’t be doing any kind of a job,
because I will.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: And what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going to study… and I’m going to read
and… I suppose I’m going to finally figure out what I want to do with my
life.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: …While she supports you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes. While she supports me… At least in the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You wouldn’t believe what they pay for
secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and
those places.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The cost of living is dirt cheap compared to
here, so we should be all right.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: The truth is we just need something
different.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’re not getting any younger and we don’t
want life to just pass us by.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I mean it; it
really sounds wonderful. We’ll certainly miss you, though - won’t we,
sweetie? Golly.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Paris. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I think this whole plan sounds a little
immature.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Oh God, I’m so relieved. Me too… I was
thinking that the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What kind of man is going to sit around in his
bathrobe picking his nose while his wife works all day?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: I don’t know, Shep. I just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Nothing. I’m just so relieved.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Come on. Don’t cry. Please. It’s all right.
It’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus, their faces! You’d think we’d told
them that we were swimming up the Yangtzee river or something.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what this is like, April? Talking
like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It’s like
the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was
probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt
better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And everything looked more real. The guys in
their uniforms. The snow on the fields, the trees. And all of us just…
walking. I mean I was scared of course. But I kept thinking: this is it.
This is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I felt that way once too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: The first time you made love to me.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …No</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bart Pollock is here.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He’s in Bandy’s office.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Looks like he wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey. Keep my name out of it.</p>
<p><strong>bandy</strong>: Frank. How are you? You know Bart
Pollock?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, we’ve never met, but -</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Glad to know you Frank.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Speaking of production control?</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Frank… This is a crackerjack. They’re
just tickled to death in Toledo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You wouldn’t have believed this guy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s perfect Presidential material in the
worst sense. A million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle
between his ears. “Frank, this is a crackerjack.”</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Wish I saw his face when you told him you
were leaving.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …Horse’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I think this is them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Sorry to be late.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You’re not late.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: The traffic was terrible.</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Wasn’t it terrible, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Route 12.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The time they finish that stretch of road,
they’ll have to start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And you must be John?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Say hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice to meetcha. Heard a lot aboutcha.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Where are your darling children?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: They’re at a birthday party. Sorry they
couldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t worry. If I had a certified lunatic
coming around the house, I’d probably get the kids out of the way
too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, look at all this food! You didn’t
have to go to any trouble for us.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It’s just some sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: John, would you like a sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Helen’s been talking it up about you people
for months.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road,
the nice young Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who’d like some sherry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Please, don’t bother Frank.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’d like some sherry. And I’ll drink Helen’s
if she doesn’t beat me to it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But, hey… Listen, though. You got a high-ball
glass…? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim.
That’s the way I like it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, this is the most wonderful egg
salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You a lawyer Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I could use a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: John, let’s not get started again about
the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pop, couldn’t you just sit there and eat your
wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See, I’ve got a good many questions to ask and
I’m willing to pay for the answers… Now, I don’t need to be told that a
man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally; that’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: John, come and have a look out this
fabulous picture window.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If he hits her with it and kills her, that’s a
criminal case.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, look, the sun’s coming out!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If all he does is break the coffee table and
give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court
over it, that’s a civil case.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Maybe we’ll see a rainbow! John, come
have a look.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How
about shutting up!</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Steady down, now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can look into it. Maybe recommend
someone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, what do you do, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I work for Knox Business Machines.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You design the machines?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Make <code>em, sell</code>em, repair `em?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: All these questions.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I sort of help sell them, I guess. I work in
the office. Actually, it’s sort of a stupid job. I mean there’s nothing
� you know, interesting about it or anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, Frank…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whaddya do it for then?</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Maybe Frank doesn’t want to be
questioned like this, son.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, okay, okay � I know it’s none of my
business. And besides, I know the answer. You want to play house, you
got to have a job. You want to play very nice house, very sweet house,
then you got to have a job you don’t like. Anyone comes along and asks
“Whaddya do it for?’ he’s probably on a four-hour pass from the State
funny farm. All agreed…? Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Sorry, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t be. I agree with everything you said,
John. We both do. That’s why I’m quitting the job in the fall and we’re
taking off.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’re moving to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you know about this, Ma…? Wow. How do you
feel about that, Ma? The nice young Wheelers are taking off!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: …John, please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Steady down, son.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How about some fresh air, John?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If that’s all right with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I don’t know if it’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: …If John wants to, I don’t see the
harm.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I hear you’re a mathematician.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You hear wrong. It’s all gone now.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: All gone?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what electrical shock treatments
are?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes. Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve had thirty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional Problems.’
Just jolted out the mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: How awful.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>:
<code>How awful...' Why, because mathematics is so</code>interesting?’</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No. Because the shocks must be awful and…
well, because it’s awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do.
I think mathematics are dull.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I like your girl, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, what do a couple of people like you have
to run away from?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re not running.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And what’s in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: A different way of life.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So maybe we are running… We’re running from
the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The hopeless emptiness? Now, you’ve said it.
Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see
the hopelessness… Wow.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You know, he’s the first person who seemed to
know what we were talking about.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s true. Maybe we are just as crazy as he
is.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: If being crazy means living life as if it
matters then I don’t care if we are completely insane. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Tell you something, Frank. I’m a
little sore at Bandy for the way he’s kept you under a bushel all these
years. This place okay, for you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is just fine, sir. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: One thing interests me, Frank, and one
thing only: selling the electronic computer to the American
businessman…</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: That’s why I’m assembling a team. Men
like you, not your average salesmen… It’ll mean more money, and I got to
be honest, maybe more of a time commitment. But you’ll be part of
something exciting, Wheeler… Computers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, sir, it sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Bart!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bart…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you happen to remember an Earl
Wheeler?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Out of Yonkers?</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Can’t say that I do. Relation of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My father. He worked at Knox almost twenty
years.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Earl Wheeler… Earl Wheeler…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No reason you would have heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Well, I’m sure he was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s something I should have mentioned
earlier… I’m leaving the firm. In the fall.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Another outfit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, it’s not another outfit –</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: Now look, Frank. Is it a question of
money? Because if it is, there’s no reason we can’t get together on a
satisfactory �</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I appreciate that, but it’s not money. It’s
more of a personal thing.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: A personal thing? I see. Frank… Let me
tell you something my father told me… A man only gets a couple chances
in life. If he doesn’t grab `em by the balls, it won’t be long before he
finds himself sitting around wondering how he got to be second rate.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: So, do me a favor… Sleep on it.
Discuss it with your wife. Because let’s face it: where the hell would
any of us be without our wives, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: And Frank, in all sincerity, if you do
decide to join us, I believe it’ll be a thing you’ll never regret.</p>
<p><strong>bart pollock</strong>: And I believe something else, too. I
believe it’d be a fine memorial to your Dad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Knowing what you’ve got, comma, knowing what
you need, comma, Knowing what you can do without, dash. That’s inventory
control.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Oh, hi Frank. Working late?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I got to dig myself out here.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I heard you were getting promoted.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: Big shot. I guess your Dad would have been
real proud, huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Huh. Yeah, I guess so…</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: maybe I should buy you a drink or
something? You know…? Celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>maureen</strong>: I’ll just get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m going to take my doll carriage and my
bear and my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my
doll house.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I thought maybe we’d give the doll house to
Madeline.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No! I don’t want to give it to
Madeline.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I already explained to you, the big things
are going to be hard to pack.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: But Madeline can have my bear and my
Easter rabbits -</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No! Just the big things. Look. Wouldn’t you
rather go outside and play with Michael.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You’ve been inside all day.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t feel like it!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, I don’t feel like explaining everything
fifteen times to somebody who’s too bored and silly to listen!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t believe you. Did something happen
today or what?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Nothing happened today that I haven’t known
about for days and days.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh God, Frank, please don’t look so dense. Do
you mean you haven’t guessed or anything?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m pregnant, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What…? Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until dinner to
tell you, but I just - well, I’ve been pretty sure all week and today I
went to the Doctor and now I can’t even pretend it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus… How long?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Ten weeks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I thought… Oh, I don’t know what I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m sorry, Frank. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know you are.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We don’t have to let this stop us. There are
things we can do. Remember that girl at school I told you about…? As
long as you do it before 12 weeks, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We’ve got to be together in this, Frank.
Otherwise nothing’s going to make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. We’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: 12 weeks. So we have time.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I love you Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So, Frank, how’s work? They gonna survive
without you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Actually… Something kinda funny happened the
other day. I did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the
hook with Bandy, and suddenly I’m The Bright Young Man.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: That’s always the way, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s incredible. I knocked this thing off in
a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of
`specialist’ salesmen.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Morons.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’d be funny, if they weren’t talking about
so much damn money.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So, you tempted?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, it’s kind of ironic, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: She okay?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I thought you turned the job down?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not yet… It’s just an option, that’s all.
With the money they’re talking, things could be different for us here.
We could get a better place. Travel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, the point is - we could be happy here.
At least for a while.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It is possible that Parisians aren’t the only
ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: So you’ve made up your mind?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Like I said, it’s an option.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …And supposing you’re right. You make all
this money and we have this interesting life here. Won’t you still be
wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like
your father.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe we let that be my business.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Your business?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s too hot for this. I’m going to get
wet.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You don’t want to go, do you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, April. Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You don’t! Because you’ve never tried at
anything. And if you don’t try at anything you can’t fail.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell do you mean I don’t try? I
support you, don’t I? I pay for this house. I work ten hours a day at a
job I can’t stand.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You don’t have to!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bullshit! I’m not happy about it. But I have
the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It takes backbone to lead the life you want,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is it alright with you if I go to the
bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell are you going to do with
this?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: And what do you think you’re going to do?
You’re going to stop me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re damn right!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Go ahead and try!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen. Listen to me. You do this - you do
this and I swear to God I’ll -</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You’ll what? You’ll leave me? Is that a
threat, or a promise?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: When did you buy this, April? I want to
know!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You know you really are being melodramatic
about the whole thing. As long as it’s done in the first twelve weeks,
it’s perfectly safe.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s now April! Don’t I get a say?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank,
don’t you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How can it be for me if the thought makes my
stomach turn over?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Then it’s for me… Tell me we can have the
baby in Paris, Frank. But don’t make me stay here. Please.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can’t have the baby in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Why not? I don’t need everything we have
here. I don’t care where we live! I mean who made these rules, anyway?
The only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant. Then we
had another child to prove the first one wasn’t a mistake. I mean how
long does it go on?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Frank. Do you actually want another child?
Well, do you?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what’s so good about the
truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they’ve lived without it.
No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell
me: do you really want another child?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in
their right mind would feel the same way.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: But I’ve had two children. Doesn’t that count
in my favor?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Christ! The fact that you even put it that
way! You make it sound like having children is a punishment.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I love my children.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you’re sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April, you just said our daughter was
mistake. How do I know you didn’t try to get rid of her, or Michael for
that matter? How do I know you didn’t try to flush our entire fucking
family down the toilet?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No that’s not true. Of course I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But how do I know April?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Stop. Please just stop, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother
doesn’t buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion
so she can, go live out some God damn fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All I’m saying is you don’t seem entirely
rational about this thing… And maybe we should get someone to help you
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …And the new job’s going to pay for that
too?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April if you need a shrink, it’ll be paid
for. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …Okay. I guess there isn’t much more to say,
then, is there?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I guess maybe it was.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can be happy here April… I can make you
happy here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ve had a great few months. It doesn’t have
to end…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I hope so Frank. I really hope so.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Thank you for waiting. Mr. Pollock can
see you now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Foiled by faulty contraception.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t say I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Wouldn’t have been the same without you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’d have been sorely missed in the old
cubicle, I can tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Besides which…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …Well, the plan always seemed a touch
unrealistic, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I suppose, it’s none of my business,
really.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. I suppose it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, we won’t be the only ones glad to hear
the news. They’ll be celebrating in the secretarial pool.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Hey! Remember the first time you brought us
here? You said, it takes a special kind of taste to enjoy Vito’s Log
Cabin!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: It’s so awful it’s kinda nice!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Look at me…! I’m just so happy. Our little
gang’s back together again!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: At least Europe’s not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I don’t really feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: I’ll dance!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Guess April’s pretty blue `bout Paris,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Think she’ll be okay?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple of days and
we can get over anything!</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: …Frank.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Frank… I…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Gee…I’m afraid I’m not very…</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Of all the inconsiderate…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Look - why don’t you take Milly home, then go
home yourself and that would take care of both sitters. Then Shep can
take me home later.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: All right with me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ll be alright?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I’m sorry you’re not going away anymore. I
know it was important to you.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Don’t take this wrong; I’ve been there
and…they don’t have so much we don’t have here.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It didn’t have to be Paris.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: You just wanted out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I wanted in. I just wanted us to live
again.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: For years I thought we shared a secret…that
we would be wonderful in the world. I didn’t exactly know how, but just
the possibility…kept me hoping.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: How pathetic is that? To put all your hopes
in a promise that was never made? See, Frank knows…he knows what he
wants. He’s found his place. He’s just fine. Married, two kids. It
should be enough. It is for him. He’s right; we were never special or
destined or anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sure you are. You’re The Wheelers. You’re a
terrific couple, everyone says so.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I saw a different life. I can’t stop seeing
it. Can’t leave, can’t stay. No damn use to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Come on, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Let me take you somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No. Please. Here. Now. In the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: April… This is what I’ve always wanted… I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I mean it, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Please, just be quiet for a minute, then you
can take me home.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s beautiful out.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes; it’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what today is?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s twelve weeks.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer.
We’ve both been under a strain. I mean I know you’re upset.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You know I’m not sleeping with you and you
want to know why?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, I’m sorry Frank, but I don’t really
feel like talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. What do you feel like talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Would it be all right if we didn’t talk about
anything? Can’t we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we
can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t think I suggested we talk about
everything all the time. My point was, we’ve both been under a strain
and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right
now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean God knows my own behavior has been
pretty weird lately… I mean, as it happens… there is actually something
I’d like to tell you about…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve been with a girl in the city a few
times.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to
me, but she got a little carried away. She’s just a kid… Anyway, it’s
over now. It’s really over. If I weren’t sure of that I guess I could
never have told you about it.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Why did you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Baby, I don’t know. I think it was a simple
case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some
kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No. I don’t mean why did you have the girl; I
mean why did you tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I mean what’s the point? Is it supposed to
make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love
with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed
to say?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why don’t you say what you feel?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I don’t feel anything.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: In other words you don’t care what I do or
who I fuck or anything?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No; I guess that’s right; I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Fuck who you like.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you see…Don’t you see, I want you to
care.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I would if I
loved you. But you see I don’t think I do anymore. And I only just
figured that out. And that’s why I’d just as soon not do any talking
right now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, now don’t give me this shit! You know God
damn well you love me!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You think so?!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know GOD DAMN WELL!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Yoo-hoo! Any one home?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’m sorry dinner’s late. Can I get anyone a
refill?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, don’t worry. It’s nice just to sit
for a bit and socialize…You really didn’t need to go through all the
trouble of cooking. I can see you have a lot to do with packing and what
not.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Actually, there’s been a change of plans.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought maybe it was obvious… April’s
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, April! I can’t tell you how
pleased I am. Oh, but I expect you’ll be needing a bigger house, now,
won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hold it a second, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t get this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s so obvious about it? I mean okay, she’s
pregnant; so what? Don’t people have babies in Europe?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh John, really. I don’t think we need
to –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m asking the man a question. If he doesn’t
want to give me the answer, I’m assuming he’ll have sense enough to tell
me so.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Suppose we just say that people anywhere
aren’t very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Okay; it’s a question of money. Money’s
always a good reason…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But it’s hardly ever the real reason. What’s
the real reason? Wife talk you out of it, or what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Little woman decide she isn’t quite ready to
quit playing house?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nah, nah, that’s not it. I can tell. She looks
too tough. Tough and female and adequate as hell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, then; it must’ve been you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: John, please, you’re being very –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or
what? You decide you’re better off here after all? You figure it’s more
comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What’s the
matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: All right, son. I think we’d better be
–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Boy!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Boy! You know something? I wouldn’t be
surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the
rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never
have to find out what he’s made of.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now look, I think that’s just about enough
out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here
and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think
it’s about time someone told you to keep your God damn -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: He’s not well, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not well, my ass! I don’t give a damn if he’s
sick or well or dead or alive, he should keep his fucking opinions in
the fucking insane asylum where they belong!</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Let’s go, son.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Big man you got there, April.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry
for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Matter of fact, the way you look right now,
I’m beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a
pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he’s got
a pair of balls.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You… fucking..!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: He’s not well, Frank!</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: All right, John. Let’s get on out to
the car now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I’m sorry April, I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right… Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I
said `Sorry’ enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I’m just about
the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don’t have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, but I’m glad about one thing, though.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what I’m glad about? I’m glad I’m not
gonna be that kid.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, okay, don’t tell me. Don’t tell me; let
me guess. I made a Disgusting Spectacle of Myself. Right?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And everything that man said is True. Right?
Isn’t that what you’re going to say?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Apparently I don’t have to. You’re saying it
for me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Why am I wrong?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Because the man is insane. He’s fucking
insane! Do you know what the definition of insanity is?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What is it, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The inability to relate to another human
being. It’s the inability to love.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: The in – the in; the inabil; the inability to
–</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh. – Oh, Frank, you really are a wonderful
talker! If black could be made into white by talking, you’d be the man
for the job. So now I’m crazy because I don’t love you – right? Is that
the point?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Wrong. You’re not crazy and you do love
me; that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: But I don’t. In fact I loathe the sight of
you. You’re just a boy who made me laugh at a party once and if you come
any closer, if you touch me or anything I think I’ll scream.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh baby listen –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fuck you, April. And fuck all your hateful,
snotty little -</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What’re you going to do now? Are you going to
hit me? To show how much you love me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, no, don’t worry, I can’t be bothered!
You’re not worth the trouble it’d take to hit you. You’re not worth the
powder it’d take to blow you up. You’re an empty –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re an empty, hollow fucking shell of a
woman. What the hell are you living in my house for if you hate me so
much? Huh? Will you answer me that? Why the hell do you fuck me? What
the hell are you carrying my child for?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you just get rid of it,
when you had the chance? Because listen. Listen: I got news for you. I
wish to God you had.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April, listen, I –</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t come any closer. Can’t I even get away
from you in the fucking woods?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: April, listen, I didn’t mean that. Honestly;
I didn’t mean what I said.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Are you still talking? Isn’t there any way to
stop your talking? I NEED to think. Can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Please come back. What’re you doing out
here?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Do you want me to scream again, Frank?
Because I will, if you say another word! I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Would you like scrambled eggs or fried?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh. It doesn’t really matter - Uh… scrambled,
I guess, if it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Fine. I’ll have scrambled too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s kinda nice having breakfast without the
kids for a change.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes. I thought you’d probably want a good
breakfast today. I mean it’s kind of an important day for you, isn’t it?
Isn’t this the day you have your conference with Pollock?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes. That’s right, yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I imagine it is a pretty big deal; for them,
anyway. What exactly do you think you’ll be doing? You never have told
me much about it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Haven’t I? Well… I think this whole thing is
about Knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers,
bigger than the `500’. Did I tell you about that?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No, I don’t believe you did.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, you know – Basically it’s just a…a big,
fast adding machine. Only…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Instead of mechanical parts, you see, it’s
got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Oh, I see. At least I think I see; yes. It’s
really sort of – interesting, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I don’t know, it’s – yeah, I guess it
is sort of interesting, in a way.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You should value what you do Frank. You’re
obviously good at it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Guess I’d better be getting started.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen, though, April; this was really nice…
I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don’t know when I’ve ever had
a – a nicer breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Thank you… I’m glad; I enjoyed it too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then you don’t – You don’t hate me, or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No; of course I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, then… So long.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hello… Milly? Everything all right? My voice
sounds what…?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Well, no, I’m afraid I’m not feeling any
better… If it’s not an inconvenience for you… This evening would be
great. What…? Oh, well- no, not if they’re outdoors playing. Don’t call
them in.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Just give them - you know, give them each a
kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know… All right,
Milly. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I think I need an ambulance…. Yes… One one
five Revolutionary Road.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Frank? They tell you what happened?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus, Shep. I couldn’t even understand half
the things he told me. He said the fetus was out before they got her
here. He said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the
placenta and now she’s still bleeding. He said she’d lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came, and now they’re trying to stop it, and he
said a whole lot of things I didn’t get, about capillaries, and he said
she’s unconscious. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: How about sitting down, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell do I want to sit down for!</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Okay. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Here, have a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She did it to herself, Shep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She did it to herself.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I’ll get some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Sit down Frank.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: …It was the worst experience of my life. Such
wonderful people. Weren’t they Shep? Poor April.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Frank lives in the city now. Where is it he
works?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Bart Pollock Associates.</p>
<p><strong>mr. brace</strong>: Computers. Interesting firm.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. brace</strong>: Have you seen him since?</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: No. Too many memories, I think. Shep’s seen
him. In the city.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: He’s just dedicated to those kids. Every
spare moment he has, he spends with them…</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: I don’t want to talk about The Wheelers any
more.</p>
<p><strong>milly</strong>: Okay. We don’t have to. We don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: I can’t tell you how pleased I am
about the little Revolutionary Road place, Howard. Remember how dreary
it looked all winter? All cold and dark and – well, spooky. Creepy-
crawly. And now whenever I drive past, it gives me such a lift to see it
all perked up and spanking clean again, with lights in the windows. And
do you know, I was just thinking, I’ve loved that little house for
years, and the Braces are the first really suitable people I’ve ever
found for it. Really nice, congenial people, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>mr. givings</strong>: Well, except for the Wheelers, you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers
but they always were a bit – a bit whimsical, for my taste. A bit
neurotic. I may not have stressed it, but they were often very trying
people to deal with, in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. givings</strong>: Actually, the main reason the little
house has been so hard to sell is that they let it depreciate so
dreadfully. Warped window frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on the walls,
filthy smudges around all the–</p>
