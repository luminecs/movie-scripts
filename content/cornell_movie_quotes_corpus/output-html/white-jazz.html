<h1 id="white-jazz">white-jazz</h1>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m old. And all I have left is the will to
remember…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …and the fear I’ll forget…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths.
I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell.
The events so brutal they beg to be re-told…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice Division. LAPD.
That’s what my face looked like before.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for.
The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who’d been teaching evidence
classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got
past Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: We should make our move now.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at
the center of a riot?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I don’t wanna be here when Noonan
and the Feds show up.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get
his gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight
too-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -relax Junior.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Sanderline, I’m Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and
a real big fan-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -you’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No you’re not. Reuben is-</p>
<p><strong>reuben ruiz</strong>: -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -for being a ranked fighter who still steals
hubcaps. Shut up. If I was gonna arrest you, I wouldn’t have let you
finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special.
Reuben’s in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say?</p>
<p><strong>ring announcer</strong>: Ladies and Gentleman…due to
circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight
this-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy League
Crimefighter. Launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into
everything else crooked and corrupt in LA.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Unaware the LAPD was walking away with his two
big witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Then you can stop pointing at him.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hungry Sanderline?</p>
<p><strong>sanderline johnson</strong>: If they got shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shrimp cocktail. You want something Reuben?</p>
<p><strong>reuben ruiz</strong>: To know why the fuck I’m here-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -mind your tone, Shitbird…</p>
<p><strong>reuben ruiz</strong>: Shitbird went out with Vaudeville. You
get your badge in a cereal box?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’re here because we want you to remember
where you live.</p>
<p><strong>sanderline</strong>: City of Angels.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Excellent Sanderline.</p>
<p><strong>reuben ruiz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You live in LA, Asshole. You do not live in
`Federal Government.’</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: We get to spend time alone now.</p>
<p><strong>reuben ruiz</strong>: Want some perfume?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Stop laughing.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What were you gonna tell Welles Noonan? He has a
subpoena with your name on it, Sanderline. Why would someone like you
need to talk to the U.S. Attorney?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’re a legbreaker for the Mob. I know the Men
that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you’re about to talk
to the U.S.-</p>
<p><strong>sanderline johnson</strong>: -but they don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And they don’t have to. Now tell me what you
were gonna tell Noonan-</p>
<p><strong>sanderline</strong>: Bet you they ran outta shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>unidentified voice</strong>: The Spook with you?</p>
<p><strong>unidentified voice</strong>: C’mon, we know he is. We’re just
trying to be mysterious-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -who’s `we?’</p>
<p><strong>unidentified voice</strong>: Me and Sam G.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: G for `Giancana.’ I owe him favors for the rest
of my life.</p>
<p><strong>unidentified voice</strong>: We’re out at the place in Palm
Springs. You should come out for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tell Sam if I get minute-</p>
<p><strong>unidentified voice</strong>: -yer gonna have to make a minute
for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him
and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight
everybody woulda’ got flush off of, including the Spade. Have him look
out the window Klein.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Sanderline, you gotta see this…</p>
<p><strong>sanderline johnson</strong>: What’m I-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Remember where you live.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: LA’s version of the Young Turks, only
meaner.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I was pissing. He was jumping.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los
Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular,
of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best…’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to
me he panicked &amp; jumped.</p>
<p><strong>tom bethune</strong>: He did spend a month in Camarillo
Mental Hospital last year-</p>
<p><strong>gas chamber bob</strong>: -and wearing that hotel robe over
his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin.</p>
<p><strong>tom bethune</strong>: Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan’s
Boxing Probe is dead. He’s got nothing-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -but time, a mandate and new targets…I need
to speak to the Lieutenant alone.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Describe to me your duty, as you understood
it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Take both men into custody before Noonan and the
Feds could, and find out what they were going to tell-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -and why did I choose you for this?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Because I’m a Cop with a law degree, and you
thought my legal-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -because your a thug with a law degree.
Because I thought by now you’d be so indebted to this Department for not
indicting and/or imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of
duty would be assured. And I made a horrible misjudgment.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bethune and Gallaudet don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Bob’s happy because he wants to be State
Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan.
Tom’s happy because Morton Diskant, who’s leading their City Council
race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they’re not seeing the larger play.
Noonan’s new target will likely be the LAPD itself.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Because that’s where I would aim: a
subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two
LAPD detectives? This screams Police Corruption. This offers Noonan the
possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Johnson did that stint at the Nut House – leak
his file to your friends at the times-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: My friends would be more interested in
this. Coroner’s preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in
Sanderline Johnson’s scalp. A matching dent on the white window sill. I
checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your
room at about the same time Johnson flew out of it. It shocks and
sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence
over the LAPD.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Alright. Where’s this going? Gun? Shield?
What?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: The appearance of disciplinary measures
taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson, so your
suspension will be recorded but sealed…and kept quiet for now-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing
around-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -we can provide adequate proof of your
dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: But you’re not dismissing me.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Just on paper. Since I misjudged the Cop I
thought you were, I’m going to leverage the Cop that you are.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Morton Diskant is to be removed from the
City Council race. The means and methods implemented to that end I will
entrust to you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You want me to torpedo Diskant so your buddy
Bethune can win a City Council seat uncontested-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -or spend the next month in lock-up before
being arraigned on charges of gross misconduct and dereliction of duty.
The preamble before you face life in prison for murder.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Diskant works Saturdays. Late.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley’s stooge now. A smart play suspending
me: a built-in shield for him if things go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Black Buick…five Cars back…feels like a
tail…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …or maybe I just need sleep.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Press camped out post-Sanderline, looking for
quotes to hang me with.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Retreat to Meg’s. My kid sister and only living
family. Mom and Pop died in `51 when their first plane ride became their
last.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I already got the Times inside.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: How much is true?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How many times have I lied to you?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Zero.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’ve always liked your Men mean.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What would Mom and Dad say?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Nothing. That’s where I learned it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Poor you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah, pour me…a cup please. Black, no sugar.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Pretty please.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’s work?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: It’s work.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’s Pete?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: More work.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA Sheriff. Bounced
when he beat-dead a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly impressed Howard
Hughes hired him on as his full-time muscle. My Sister’s new Hump. My
oldest living Friend.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You look like Death taking a shit.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’s still got that MGM-face.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You’re still the only guy who ever traded
movie-potential for Police work.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Because in the movies they make you pull your
punches.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No. We’re going to the Cocoanut-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: ‘Favor’ mean `free?’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Means $500 an hour.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Gimme the phone so I can find another Date-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -you’re the only Woman I know who calls Men-</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: -you’re the only Man I know who doesn’t call
Women.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Morton Diskant, a man who preferred migrant
workers to million dollar ballparks. Beating Bethune in their City
Council Race despite getting outspent 10 to 1. If he wins, the Dodgers
don’t get a Stadium, Mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles
from City Hall and Bradley makes sure I burn for Sanderline Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior brought along because he begged. Already
hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: You got a birthday coming up.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: On the 16th, right? How old?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Old. What are you writing?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Just notes…about work-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -what `work’?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Mostly compare and contrast stuff.
Street work versus textbook-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -chapter 1: don’t write shit down. Chapter 2: or
other Cops might kill you.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: So you think Noonan will come after
you for the Sanderline thing? He seems like a real hard charger.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I heard he was coming after both of us.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Indictments. Prison time. Whole nine.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Holy Jesus. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m seriously thinking about turning
Junior…testifying against you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time
the same thought:</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: God help me if he ever hits me like that.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior picked up this Quiff jocking other Fags
in a Men’s Room. But Quiff was a Law Student who wanted his record kept
clean.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: He should suck his dick. Y’know?
Put the icing on it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Tell me that wouldn’t sell it…plus
he’s a Communist.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: We’re ruining his career, not his soul. Reload
the camera.</p>
<p><strong>morton diskant</strong>: Off me!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Drop out of the City Council race or I send
these pictures to the papers.</p>
<p><strong>morton diskant</strong>: I’ll fight you rotten-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -and maybe salvage something that’s a close
cousin to `respect.’ But what about your wife and kid getting hold of
those pictures?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Take the Quiff home.</p>
<p><strong>quiff</strong>: My name’s Franklin-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I need a nod from you Morton, let’s me know you
get it-</p>
<p><strong>diskant</strong>: -don’t say my name…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He gets it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Someone from the Times will call for a quote.
Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real.</p>
<p><strong>diskant</strong>: You eventually lose the ability to
reconcile the things you’ve done to people. That’s Hell.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Y’know Hughes has a job you’re tailor-made
for. I already gave him your-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Stop pretending you’re not a pig for all this,
Klein.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I still got a day job, Pete-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: -tossing more Bantamweights out windows?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The Mutt jumped.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Not even the people who don’t know you believe
that. If somebody from the DA’s office decides to dig, you could fry
Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who’s got a fleet of planes,
fly you outta the country on a moment’s notice. C’mon – it’s a cake
legal gig. He just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking
him.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm It’ll be worth
it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Klein-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -you know who Hector Magdalena is?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …yeah…Narco’s Snitch.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: He’s missing. His home was broken into at
some point within the last hour.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: So send Robbery.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: The only thing taken was him. Wilshire
Station is on-scene. Get over there right now.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Call it penance.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I thought that’s what Morton Diskant was-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -that makes one of us. 1284 South
Tremaine.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior. Meet me at 1284 South Tremaine. 20
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the LAPD Narcotics
Division. A Michigan Catholic poisoned by 25 years in this desert.
Recently divorced despite seven kids with his Ex.</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You smell like bourbon Wilhite-</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: -fuck off. This is handled. And pull your
idiot partner out of there-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Junior’s already here-</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it’s my
scene.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay
that order. I’m here on his word. Now, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And presumed what?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: I could give a shit. I just want to this
case to get a quick burial.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ll bet. Who made the call?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Some old broad heard an `argument’ and
buzzed Wilshire Station.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s the family?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: The wife and daughter were in Santa
Barbara. Just got back.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: At 2 AM?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: The Wife said she got into a fight with her
Parents, left ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why wasn’t Hector with `em?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: What do you think they were fighting about?
Santa Barbara Wasps don’t fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What about the Son?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: He’s got a mean streak. And he and Hector
had been at each others throats for months. Have Tommy picked up. He
likes to loaf at those nigger jazz joints in Watts.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Alright, you better cut out before people start
asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons.</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and pin this
thing fast or you’ll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your
front door.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What are you talking about Wilhite?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: You queered the Fed’s Fight Probe by
killing that boxer and they already had a hard-on for the LAPD- Bradley
sent you down here as damaged goods…think about it. Everybody sees
what’s coming. Now close this quick.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The God-sized problems I triggered tossing
Sanderline take shape: the LAPD’s sanctioned dope-pusher vanishes –
that’s a pretty juicy spot to stick a new probe.</p>
<p><strong>biddie</strong>: -shifty…colored…y’know Negros are planning
an invasion! After our white women and our water supply-</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: -where was this Peeper you saw?</p>
<p><strong>biddie</strong>: Bushes. Spyin’ on Lucille. Seen him there
before! He’s a black saboteur looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna
breed a mulatto master race-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Officer.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything
else about her that rings true?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or
two, then silence.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What’s this `Peeper’ riff she’s on?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: She saw someone in the bushes earlier.
She’s reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She’s also
reported flying saucers, so…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: See if any of the other Neighbors can verify
this `Peeper’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: No one touch a thing `til I
say.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Dave-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Lieutenant Klein. I said
<code>meet me' in twenty minutes' not</code>go in without me.’</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: All I’ve been doing-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -is stepping on dicks. You don’t know the
history, the players or the play.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The Department gave Magdalena a monopoly on the
LA dope trade decades ago-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -what Department?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Us Pollyanna – LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in
exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in
Darktown and East LA-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -Black and Mexican-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -give the man a prize. He’d also rat his
competition and kill the ones we couldn’t convict. Now keep your mouth
shut and stay on my hip.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Loaded him into a car-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted
for?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Except for the Son’s: Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The old lady hear dogs barking? Gunshots?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, I asked. Just the yelling.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: She didn’t hear barking…so they were either
lousy guard dogs…or they knew the Killer. You can’t hit something this
clean unless you’re point blank. He could’ve been petting them when he
fired: look at the burn pattern- Like when you shoot something with a
silencer.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ve shot things with silencers… And the old
lady didn’t hear any gunshots.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: You make a family member for it?
Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Do you want to issue an APB?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the
Mother and Daughter?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: It’s Klein.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Update.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hector’s gone. Blood that may or may not be his
leads out to the garage. Two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of
a struggle. The house is intact.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Family?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Wife and Daughter are here.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Describe their state.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Mother Madge aggrieved. Daughter
Lucille…indifferent. The son is persona non grata and a strong early
suspect.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Alright, kick everyone out. Including all
police personnel.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Don’t question me. Is your partner on
hand?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Have him bag and seal everything and bring
it to Wilshire Station. Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him
into custody. No APB’s, nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this
situation.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You want me to-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -no more information over an open line.
I’ll be at the Bethune event later on today. Find me there.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m giving you on-scene command. Bradley wants
everyone removed from the premises and the entire house bagged for
evidence and brought to Wilshire Station. Can you handle this?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Entirely. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: To find Tommy Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep. Buzz
dispatch. A message from Pete. `Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed Tail. Noonan
already up my ass. Let’s see if they got guts enough to keep following
me South.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dispatch gave me Tommy’s make and model: A `32
Ford Deuce with a bent eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to goose the cops
into giving chase.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces glow like
Martians this far down Crenshaw.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Get Lester and get me a scotch straight.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Sanderline Johnson was my second cousin,
Peckerwood. I wouldn’t drink that with my gun hand.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced crooner. But
a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the
hands of none other than Hector Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of
Sanderline Johnson…y’got stones showing up this far South.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I
understood something he was saying.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shit. He’s wise.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: To what? You looking for him?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Just never got this…</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Too white to appreciate good grass.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead.
Tommy is our sole suspect.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Muthafucker – there is a God. If only
I’d known this an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last
night?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: I don’t let him, he just does. Nails on
a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie
Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex greaser kid
trying to play `Round Midnight,’ said that fool couldn’t find them keys
with a flashlight.’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tommy’s playing days are over.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What time did he show up?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Around four. Him and these Pachucos
poppin’ switchblades like punks. The only thing that was keepin’ him
`untouched’ was Hector… Is he really dead?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: There’s blood all over his house, seems to
belong to him. There’s just no body. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: I don’t feature Tommy for it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’s that? How many times has he been in here,
busted you up?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Yeah, but he ain’t got the salt to
truly take a Man’s life. Especially not Hector’s…he was scared of
him.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: `Cuz Hector been whippin’ Tommy’s ass
from the time he could talk.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What about the Wife? Beat her too?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: We used to call that old bitch `the
Burglar’…eyes were so black, it looked like she had a mask on.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And the daughter? Lucille?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Things up off the street. Rumors.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Like?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Hector had turned her out. Using her
the way the Romans used to use their daughters when they did business:
Some pussy to sweeten the pot. Rumor was she got picked up in this trick
sweep few weeks back.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hector was whoring her?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Hector was an evil Muthafucker.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: …born with ruthless bones. And if he
really is dead and gone, this game `bout to explode.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What game?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Drugs. Especially here in South
Central. Hector ran it uncontested. Lotta cats gonna rush in now, try to
plant a flag.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tommy can’t hold the throne?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Tommy couldn’t hold his pecker without
Hector’s help and he knows that. He’s gonna bury himself like a tick.
Good luck turning him up, he took six or seven grand out the safe
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Eyes and ears for me Lester. He turns up, you
get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: If I don’t kill him first.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant
dropping out the only way you could have won this race?</p>
<p><strong>tom bethune</strong>: Not at all. My message of civic
advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting
to hit home.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Anything you’d like to say to future
constituents?</p>
<p><strong>tom bethune</strong>: I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard and
relish!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Fritz Koenig. German born. Former US Spymaster,
current Head of the LAPD’s Intelligence Division. He and Bradley in the
middle of their own Cold War – each fighting to be the second most
important member of the LAPD behind Chief Parker.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: These functions aren’t normally open to
Jews.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Someone with your accent should never be allowed
to say `Jew’ again.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: That accent allowed me to execute many a
Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Then we’re both Traitors: Ellis Island said
Grandpa’s `Kleinsasser’ was two syllables too long.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I wouldn’t have expected so public a showing
after Sanderline Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: He jumped Fritz.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I’m sure he did. And where is your young
partner this day?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Working his first big job.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Might the job involve the LAPD’s most
important missing Wetback, Hector Magdalena?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I’ve known Stemmons since the academy. He
was a top pupil. A peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with
details.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Kid might have some climb in him. Reminds me of
another pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I’m puzzled as to why the Bradley would
assign you to the Magdalena case when you’re neither Homicide nor
Robbery…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: There’s no body, and nothing was taken except
Hector.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: He does know how to delegate doesn’t he…and
also I’m sure that poor Negro’s nosedive has put you squarely in his
debt.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Keep me abreast will you? Chief Parker is
understandably nervous. Situations like these tend to yield grief…and
we’ve the FBI poking around our garden patch.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My ass first Fritz, yours second.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground and he’s got
a war chest to keep him there. The only way we take him quickly is to
issue a citywide APB-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -no. We can’t risk that. Do you make him
for the murderer?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah. Hector’s disappearance is definitely an
inside job. That whole family feels hinky. The daughter was all bruises
and no tears and Hector’s hop-head wife looks part punching bag.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Do you suspect either of the women?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Verify that. Where is your partner?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings
as an evidence teacher and I trust him more than you. Find Tommy
Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort &amp; I want him apprehended
Klein, not killed.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What about Hector? Still missing.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: And most likely dead. Find the Son.
Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter – I
want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And what do we do if Hector turns up?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: If he’s alive, bring him to me. If he’s
dead, have him John Doe’d at the morgue until Noonan can be drawn off
and this FBI situation sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Wilhite. He was operating Hector-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -don’t worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal
directly with me. Now go out the back. I don’t want the press
recognizing you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You got a light?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If you snap a picture of me, I get to set you
on fire. Fair?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: It didn’t look like you were all that upset with
the attention.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Good thing you’re not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Your power of observation leaves lots to be
desired.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Don’t thank me: these things are bad for
you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You believe everything you read?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You believe anything you read?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Do you eat Dinner?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Make a note: steal Bethune’s guest- list, then
go door-to-door until you find her again.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: This everything from the house?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Everything worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What did you tell the Watch Commander
upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: That this was a random drug
seizure. I’m not using names and I’m number coding everything. A load of
interesting stuff too. I got unregistered fire-arms, more dope than I’ve
ever seen, and some mail from business associates that seems hinky. We
should follow up- -here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings’ Hector had some
real estate dealings-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -bag it until Bradley orders us otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: How do you solve a case when the
evidence is in bags?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You don’t. Our job is to find Tommy. And why is
that out?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I’m making notes separate from- -I
thought we were investigating Magdalena’s disappearance-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Don’t write shit down. What do you need Kid? A
little bouncing ball, bottom of the screen? Magdalena is twenty years
dirty with this Department…do you think a word of that exists on
paper?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: …No.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And there’s reasons. Respect them.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Now we need surveillance set up on the house and
revolving tails on both Madge and Lucille Magdalena. Their alibi is they
were in Santa Barbara when Hector vanished. Find out if that’s real. The
tails and the stakeout start tonight. Can you manage this?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Sure, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Police blotter gets me bupkis. Buzz dispatch.
Looking for license hits on that `32 Ford Deuce. Nothing. Zoom Darktown
again. Zilch. Tommy dug in deep.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ freak. Boob man.
Pete’s prime benefactor. Nobody had seen him in years.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A
pleasure Lt. Klein.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dave. Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Indeed. Please.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Thanks for your time on a Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s Mr. Hughes?</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Unavailable. Unfortunately. But I’ve been
given full authority to-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -I’m not contagious…if that’s what he’s worried
about.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: I don’t find that the least bit humorous
Lt. Klein.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yes you do. What’s your pitch Mr. Milteer?</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: An
<code>Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe signed a Service Contract that she's now willfully violating by acting in a Z-grade horror picture presently</code>shooting’
in Griffith Park. Despite entreaties for her to cease participation in
this absurdity, she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us.
Thus we would like her destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What makes you think I can do a better job than
your people?</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Mr. Bondurant says you’re one of the
smarter people he knows-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -dubious honor if you knew the other people Pete
knows. So you want to catch her in violation of her Service Contract?
Something like that?</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Exactly. The morality clause in particular
as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating: Nymphomaniac,
Criminal, Communist…anything along these lines. Once you visit the set
of her `Attack of the Atomic Vampires,’ you’ll see the void that is her
character. We haven’t a photograph handy, but she’s playing the lead
female role.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m happy to help. But my price is $10,000. Not
5.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: $10,000 should buy more than help.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: For 10 give it any name you want. I’m a salaried
employee of LAPD, that means I’ll have to find time off hours to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Agreed. Start tonight. Someone’s been
stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. There’s no proof that it’s
her, but it’s her. Peter will provide you addresses.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Thank you Peter.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: We look forward to your updates.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Sergeant, pass a message to Stemmons: I want him
to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and
at some point between now and then, I’ll need him to do a preliminary
work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe. B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Twice in a day doesn’t happen. Not in a city
like LA. Not like this. This is fate. This is Cupid firing his whole
fucking quiver. Move. Make sure she’s real.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: This is the big Armada landing, so I need
everybody’s energy up, up up! Where’s my Alien Commander?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Mickey Cohen: one-time LA crime kingpin and West
Coast Mob heavy who now trawls for loose change.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Cecil B. Demoted.</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: Where Klein goes tsuris follows. This
is what I hate about being down, lip from the likes of you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: If this is
<code>down' I never want to see</code>out.’ How the mighty have
fallen.</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: Which one of us are you talking about
Klein? Word is the Federal Bureau is all hot and bothered with you
Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar schtups his personal assistant and makes him
wear ladies hose.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What else are you hearing?</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: That this Welles Noonan character has
developed quite a crush. That you might want to consider relocating to
Dogdick, Delaware.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Been a marked man for years Mick.</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: But the bullseye on your back’s never
been quite so big…if you need a new line of work, I got this faygele
leading man needs replacing-</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: His agent told me he could play
straight.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: His agent lied.</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: You interested?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No. But I am interested in your leading lady.
Bradley sent me. Saw her at the Bethune-</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: -not a chance. I’m still trying to
play hide the submarine.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You want Chief Bradley angry?</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: Ten years ago I could call for that
little Pisher’s head on a stick. And now…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And now the only thing you’re putting on sticks
are corn dogs. What’s her name, Mick?</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: Glenda.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why was she there?</p>
<p><strong>mickey cohen</strong>: Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda and
Rock to any event where there’s cameras – Glenda gets guest-a’- honor
treatment everywhere with that shape a’ her’s…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What she drive?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Coffee’s in the kitchen. Let’s go
over this quick because I’m beat.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We’re set on a place where we can stash
you and Rock. It’s in Topanga Canyon, two weeks-</p>
<p><strong>rockwell</strong>: -two weeks? My body’ll fall apart-</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: -think of it as 14 days of push-ups-
Are you sure about this Sid? Seems shaky. Was this Mickey’s idea?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And I think it’s brilliant! Inspired! The
two leads of Mickey Cohen’s magnum opus get kidnapped! The press’ll eat
it up! They’ll write about `Gangster Mickey,’ the glory days. Couple a’
headlines like that and interest in Atomic Vampires will go through the
roof! Who’s gonna grab you?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: A charmer I knew in another
life…George Ainge.</p>
<p><strong>sid frizell</strong>: Is he okay with making it look
real-</p>
<p><strong>rockwell</strong>: -he can’t hit me in the face! That’s a
deal-breaker!</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: He’ll be thrilled to knock me
around. Plus he’s holding something of mine, so we can kill two birds.
He’ll grab us Tuesday in front of the Pacific Dining Car.</p>
<p><strong>rockwell</strong>: What about Hughes?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: What about him? That angle can only
help us.</p>
<p><strong>sid frizell</strong>: I’m dying to know…was he the Spruce
Goose between the sheets?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Hung like a newborn and he called my
tits `propellers.’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The real howler: fake kidnappings always
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Thinking I could tip Milteer off to the kidnap
plot and pick up the other half of my payment… Thinking I should just
give the first half back now…’cuz I know right now I’ll never hurt
her.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No sense of time. Exhaustion steals it. A full
hour earlier than I told Junior to meet me. I need sleep.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: This routine had been done before. That old
broad babbling about a Peeper. The only other link to Hector Magdalena’s
disappearance.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: That’s for Sanderline Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: -what were you firing at?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The only lead on Magdalena – we’re after the
same guy you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: -write that name down:
<code>Magda-LEE- na' or</code>Magda-LAY-na.’ No, we were after you. But
thanks for the name.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Assumed the Feds were smart. Assumed they were
ready to stick a new probe into the LAPD’s deal with Hector, like
Bradley warned, like everyone feared. But they had no clue and I just
handed them the whole God damn thing. Like I said: I need sleep…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom
have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut
Faggot you are?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic,
dead-on.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Drop him.</p>
<p><strong>derby #1</strong>: You don’t want to take him in?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: I only want to bring him in when I
know he’ll never leave.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Ice. Bradley’s on his way down.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: That’s mine…you needed some mopping
up.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Who found me?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I did. I got there at eleven like
you said, right as two black &amp; white’s pulled up: you were out cold
in a gutter `round the block. Did Noonan knock you out?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: He hit me with his car first.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: The Captain was the only one here
at this hour…</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: If I need your help later on, can I count on
it?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Of course you can.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Chief.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: The Lieutenant was thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Progress on Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: No fingerprints. Clean crime scene.
Canvassed the neighborhood. A senile neighbor did report a possible
Peeper-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -confirmed Peeper.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Is that who knocked you out?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan knocked me out.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: He’s having you tailed then…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And he knows the Magdalena name and that I was
chasing a suspect – the Peeper Lucille strips for.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: She knows someone watches?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And who he is. She has to. I want access to her
juvie sheet or whatever arrest records exist. Rumor was Hector whored
her out to dealers he did business with.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: That’s immaterial.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: It is if you’re eliminating her as a
suspect-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -did you confirm their alibi?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston
Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and
they’ve confirmed their visit and also corroborated the argument that
resulted in them leaving early.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: One alteration to my previous orders-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -previous orders being what? Assign the Cop
Noonan blames for his dead boxing probe to the case that’s becoming his
new crusade?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Step out Stemmons.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: No direct approach on the mother or the
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No. Madge was a battered wife and Lucille was a
suborned whore. If that’s not motive, what is? You want answers then we
brace those two hard.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: If you do so directly, if they’re formally
questioned then Noonan may find out and go after them with Federal
warrants.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan will figure out who and what Hector was
sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Yes he will, so we buy time, keep him
busy-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -until when?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the
city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction
on Dodger stadium-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -this is bigger than a fucking ballpark! Hector
Magdalena and Narco is the powder-keg, blows the whole Department to
hell.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Don’t be dramatic, it looks weak. Right
now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so I supply him with one-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -me. You want me to draw him off-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -you’ve been drawing him off. And the more
he sees you the less he’ll think of anything other than getting you. Now
find Tommy and take him alive. Do not let Noonan get to him. As a
potential major case witness against the LAPD, Tommy Magdalena isn’t
just a powder- keg, he’s an atom bomb.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley has a bigger angle and I’m getting close
to it…I just haven’t hit home. Yet.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Seltzer will take the blood out.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I give you the shirt off my back
and you bash me!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the
room, you leave the fucking room.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I made a file on the Bledsoe broad.
The one you asked about.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Thanks. But forget it.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I spent a whole day putting it
together and this skirt’s got skeletons.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17.
Prostitution arrest at 21. Known associate of a Kern County homicide
victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp.
Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Forget it. Burn it, s’not important now.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Why is it not important?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George
Ainge-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -what about Magdalena?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -after you get the Ainge address, get back to
the Magda-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: -is Ainge related to this Cunt?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: We’re partners in name only. You want to stay in
the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding
that address.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan replaced the Buick with a Packard and a
better Shadow-Man. But I could still spot the tail.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like
a junkie does. No logic. Just the push.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Better looking than the last guy
Howard hired. Once you heal. Wait a minute. You were there, the other
night, the Bethune Party…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Mickey told me this
<code>Bent Cop' everybody used to call- -</code>The Enforcer’ was asking
about me. Told me to be careful. So you’re LAPD after all…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: In theory.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: You’re going to arrest me for
breaking and entering?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Depends. Those Howard’s?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Everything’s Howard’s.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Except you.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: That’s why I left.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You just shop here now?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Some of our extras haven’t had a
vegetable since Truman.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Attack of the Atomic Vampires…</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: We can’t all be Audrey Hepburn. Plus
it pays bills.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Better than a billionaire does? Go make amends
and finish out your service contract Ms. Bledsoe.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Not if there was just one day left
on it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: I’m better than that.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’re also better than a starring role in
schlock horror flick that’ll never see a screen, regardless if it’s
leading lady gets `kidnapped’ or not.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: This isn’t the first time you’ve
spied on me.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Nor the second.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Well you’ve got me all giftwrapped,
Enforcer-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Dave. You’re on Hughes’ bad side Ms. Bledsoe.
It’s not a bright place to be. So please go-</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: -Glenda. And tell Howard I’ll take
my chances with the fake vampires.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Klein. Go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>dispatch</strong>: Message from a Lester Lake: asked that you
contact him immediately.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant Klein,
LAPD-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -this is LAPD-put Lester on the phone or I’ll
have your liquor license and after-hours permits yanked inside the
hour…</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Dave?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Got your message.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Girl that works here, gigs the late
sets, the torch stuff Fridays and Saturdays, name of Tilly Hopwell.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I saw her singing the other night.</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: I think she’s been truckin’ with Tommy
Mag. Got pipes like Ella but she’s a junk fiend: caught her mainlining
in the ladies room a month back.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Heroin? Tommy get her hooked?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Dunno, but when he’d get drunk, he’d
trade Horse for blowjobs out back a’ the club.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s this girl now?</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Didn’t show up for work last night.
Called a friend of hers, a waitress that works here too, said she was at
Bido Lito’s in Hollywood. Said she was `hiding out.’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: She actually said `hiding out?’</p>
<p><strong>lester lake</strong>: Then she got off the phone. Fast. If
Tilly’s running with that demon, you gotta get her out of there. She got
a lot more good in her than not-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown altogether. Holed
up in Hollywood. Hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a face out
front if I get lucky. Wait till Bido Lito’s gets busy before I make my
move.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tommy’s Deuce.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Now he’s on foot.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar. Suspect fleeing
scene in red `32 Ford Deuce travelling westbound on Wilcox, vehicle
impaired, intercept at Hollywood Blvd-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -and I need an ambulance to respond to 1607
North Ivar, second floor, female negro, possible overdose.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s your father!? Did Wilhite kill him!?-
TELL ME!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: That Gray Packard: not the Feds. Make them
Magdalena rivals. I left Bido Lito’s too fast to catch a tail. So where
did they come from?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Dave? Dave!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s Dan Wilhite?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Did he kill your piece-a’-shit pimp Dad?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Or was it that Peeper across the street that
jacks off to your sad little shows-</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Dave, please! CHIEF BRADLEY!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s Magdalena’s body!?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You murdered him! That’s why the dogs didn’t
bark: they knew you-</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: What the fuck are you-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -you’re gonna shell it out for me or I’m gonna
kick your teeth in…</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: I outrank you Klein! Are you out of your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You fingered Tommy for his father’s
disappearance and pressed me to do the same to cover your ass!</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: He was the prime suspec-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -he was screaming about
<code>set-ups,' and about how a</code>Cop’ killed Hector –he thought I
was you Wilhite. The gray Packard that gunned him down showed up three
minutes after my dispatch call…</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: -so cops killed him too, is that the kind
of bullshit you wa-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -not just cops. Narcotics Cops. You clip Hector,
then his kid becomes collateral &amp; you gotta clip him too.</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: -you’re paddlin’ air pal.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Am I? Where’s Hector? You can’t file murder
charges without a corpse. Who knows this? Cops know this- You would know
this.</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: -I’m going to the review board and have you
cited for-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -When’d Hector start pimping Lucille?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: What-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: –When did he start whoring out his own daughter
to sweeten business deals?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: I have no fucking idea what you’re-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -he ever offer her to you?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: I’m married!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And about to be divorced. Have you ever fucked
Lucille?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I don’t care where you get your dick wet
Wilhite. I care that you’re covering. Twenty years dirty with this
fucked-up family…your secrets must stink like rot.</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: You’re worried about every wrong thing
Klein. Bradley’s tee’ing you up to take a big fat fall-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -then we’ll hold hands on the way down: look
further up the street. The Black Buick.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Feds. They’re all over this. You think I’m the
only one that burns? Two decades worth of twisted shit between your
division and the biggest dope dealer in LA?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I know I’m going down Dan…that’s the difference
between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Klein!</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I said `no direct approach!’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: You were instructed to take Tommy Magdalena
alive. Do I have to remind you of the coroner’s file-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -enough of your `Sanderline’ bullshit. I’ll
checkmate with an admission of guilt to Noonan himself.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Keep your voice down!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ll bargain immunity in exchange for testimony
on how the LAPD really runs: Magdalena dope profit kickbacks, Diskant
run out of the city council race on your word, suspended cops pulling
shakedowns. I’ll give Noonan a dozen new probes for the one I
killed.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I’m assuming command of this investigation
myself.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What investigation? Tommy’s murder? Hector’s
disappearance? What are you investigating?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: You’re on one month’s unpaid leave as of
this moment.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’re scamming something big.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -if you make any further inquiries into
this case I’ll strip you of rank, have your pension revoked and walk
that coroner’s file into the Times myself…stay away from this.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What’s your fucking angle Bradley!?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: You’re done Klein. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Dave listen: don’t do anything else
to jeopardize yourself…I can protect you…I’ve been putting some things
together-</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: Central, this is Klein, I need an update on
that overdose I called in. What’s the girl’s condition?</p>
<p><strong>dispatch</strong>: Lieutenant Klein, the girl, Tilda Hopwell
was pronounced D.O.A. at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: George Ainge’s address.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: You’re in no state to conduct
yourself as a Police Offic-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -shut up. Don’t identify yourself, don’t badge
him, don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How do you know Glenda Bledsoe?</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: Knew that whore’d try to muscle
me-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -don’t call her a whore again.</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: If you gave her as many paychecks as
me, you’d know `whore’ fits like a fuckin glov-</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: She fucked for a fee! Jesus Christ
she’s a pro! What is she paying to get that blade back-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What? What `blade?’</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: What’s she paying you to recover her
knife?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: Y’all are Cops!?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shut your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: Back in
<code>50, Glenda the Good Witch put a blade in her pimp</code>bout as
deep as I put my pink in her, this mongrel named Dwight Gillette.</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: Could use a couple LAPD favors, and
ain’t guttin’ a pimp still a crime?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Capitol crime.</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: Guess who she asked to hold the knife?
Guess why she brought me in on this kidnap thing? It was her way a’
buying it back-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -show it to me.</p>
<p><strong>george ainge</strong>: I’ll have my lawyer take a picture of
it for you-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m not arresting you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -that blade or your life.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Last time you push me out a door!
For a dirty split-tail! You’re- -not dragging me down! If Bradley
doesn’t get you, Noonan will! And- -you’re gonna burn all by
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Call it: the knife was here. Ainge was crawling
under his bed not to escape me, but to hand it over. Too hate-wired to
see it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior the Player. Junior the Underestimated.
Junior the Former Evidence Teacher: a murder weapon, a witness, a
two-hour head-start.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior the Flush: my $5000 down- payment from
Hughes gone. Junior the Merciful: He should’ve put a bullet in my
brain.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Everything inspection neat. No mail, no personal
items. Eagle scout perfect.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Meg wake up Pete.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: …Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Take some pills, will you?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ll give you a grand to locate and tail Junior
Stemmons.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Your partner?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Past tense.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Two grand.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Done. Tell me what he does, who he talks to,
where he goes, and if he’s got this mutt named George Ainge stashed
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s Stemmons’ address?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You moonlighting?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Doing some ad hoc dope seizures for Dan
Wilhite. Still love taking the occasional door down.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You were born for the street Fritz. I never
featured you for the suit and tie set.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: We’re of a common bloodline Boy-o.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’d you get that haul?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Some reformed spic dope dealers that
normally dabble in reefer.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Seized from Chavez Ravine. Thirty pounds.
The City is cracking down on the dreaded to make room for their beloved
Dodgers. They remove the Mexicans, we remove the rest.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why? They could hawk heroin right along with
peanuts and hot dogs. Have the whole bleacher section goofing on
horse.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: A new found dedication these days? What’s
prompting such odd hours?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Playing catch-up.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: The boy Chief seems to be running both of us
ragged.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: He currying favor with Chief Parker with this
Chavez Ravine sweep?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Parker appreciates Bradley’s political
skills…and the addition of a professional Ball-club to our fare city
fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner, brighter, LA.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Sounds boring.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Stale milk to me too. And how are you
faring? Is our visiting U.S. Attorney still in hot pursuit?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Borrowed time Fritz.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah…a small favor. Stemmons home address if you
have it. He’s in a bit of a bind.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Bigger than your own?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: A lot bigger.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: 3160 Rossmore. Apartment #6.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Did you want me to clip Stemmons?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Not yet. By now, he’s stashed Ainge, so he’s
travelling solo.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who’s this `Ainge’ clown anyway?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Not important.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Oh, Milteer wants a progress report on the
Movie Broad – Bledsoe-</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: I could say something witty about
“gentleman callers at this hour, covered in blood” but–</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: George Ainge.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Is that his? Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No. But I know about Dwight Gillette and the
knife you’re trying to barter back. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Then why are you here? Y’should be
picking up a paycheck from Hughes.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m not watching you for him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: If you’re planning on shaking me
down for `favors,’ go pick-up your paycheck Mr. Klein. Or are you being
a policeman right now?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: The good ones are called
<code>Policemen.' The bad ones are called</code>Cops.’ I’m a Cop.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Another `cop’ has this information on you. He
has the murder weapon too. He might use it against you before I can stop
him. Can you go somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: You’re protecting me? You don’t even
know me…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Just the parts you wish I didn’t. The place in
Topanga Canyon where your going to hole up for the kidnapping thing. Is
it safe?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Get your coat.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: -KGFJ news at the top of the hour. U.S.
Attorney Welles Noonan today announced his intention to probe what he
called `widespread corruption’ within the Los Angeles Police Department
and promised an equally widespread round of criminal indictments
before-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Did Ainge know about this place?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: No. I didn’t want to tell him till
after.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Nothing’s going to happen to you…</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: I don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m not gonna let it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: This is my sister’s number. Name is Meg. Call if
there are problems.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Looking for leverage. Figure out Bradley’s angle
before I fry. Madge and Lucille in custody. No Hector and no Tommy
equals No leads. Save one.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dan Wilhite. Dispatch shot me his temporary
address. Some beach flop he fled to after his wife put him out.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My first thought, pure panic: Noonan figured the
Narco-Magalena connection.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: But it wasn’t a Federal Subpoena. Wilhite was
being called to testify by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn’t piss without
Bradley’s say-so. Bradley trying to beat Noonan to the punch and burn
the LAPD himself…why?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Swap my car for Wilhite’s. The former head of
the LAPD’s Narcotics division dead in the trunk. Call it the leverage I
was looking for – his body can buy me out of bad spot-</p>
<p><strong>bam</strong>: me hit from behind by the Peeper. BAM: me
firing at the Peeper. Hit him in the left shoulder. BAM: Grabbing
Wilhite’s shoulder in the Magdalena bathroom, him howling in pain.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on Lucille, a girl
younger than his youngest daughter. Call it grounds for divorce…Call
Wilhite Hector Magdalena’s murderer…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley trying to bury me too. That subpoena
means my fifteen year career with the LAPD just went up in smoke.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hey-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: -Junior’s left the fucking planet.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You find him?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out
front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the
back seat. Think he’s living outta that car. After he left, I tried to
get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: That knife is in there-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: -the what?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Meet me down the street from his place. You got
bolt cutters?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’ll bring `em.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who’s car is that?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Long story.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like
he was on a dope jag.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful.
He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don’t know
what he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the
alley, back of his place.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has
called me twice.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: One thing at a time pal.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior the Insane: You couldn’t hide what he was
hiding in 1958 LA, and not have it rot your mind.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior stealing evidence from the Magdalena
crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior the Climber, trading me up to Noonan.
Thinks bootlicking will buy him a Bureau gig.</p>
<p><strong>my narrator voice</strong>: The safe scared me more than all
of it because a safe doesn’t get installed overnight…he’d been working
on something, planning something…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Get it open if you can and meet me back at
Meg’s!</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Stay right here. I’ll get it all
and come back. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Call it. Keep going and give up Wilhite’s car
and the corpse inside, or lay back and deal with Noonan’s Buzzcuts.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Civil servants can’t afford manicures?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Breaking and entering, theft, and
willful destruction of private property…and I’ll add attempted murder to
the current first degree murder charge I’m about to file against
you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Proof. If you had it, you wouldn’t be fucking
around with shitty shakedown routine – you’d file. Coercion equals
confession. So let’s see you pound it out of me.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Where are the files you stole from
Sergeant Richard Stemmons.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior. Your secret weapon right? I mean, I know
J. Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags’ don’t make
the best major case witnesses. I’m worried those burning dildos may have
damaged his credibility.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Oh I don’t need his testimony Klein.
I’ll just force yours.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Not if you had the next hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Sanderline Johnson, your links to Sam
Giancana to Mickey Cohen, extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire. I’ll put
you in every pair of cross- hairs I can find. I’ll torch everything
you’ve ever touched. You have no idea how deep I run Klein. And how far
I’m willing to go to fuck you-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -everyone knows I’m a piece-a-shit. What are you
proving? Bradley’s the guy flanking you right now. The guy who’s
vulnerable right now.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: You’re all angles and graft Klein.
Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -you done anything with the Magdalena case?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Prelims: drug pusher gone missing,
presumed dead, we’re investigat-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Dealing drugs for 20 years! Arrested once. Hall
a’ fame career! You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his
house…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Jesus Christ, you need cue cards? Come after me:
you get me. Go after what I can give you and you get the LAPD’s
power-set on a slab.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: I don’t believe you’d turn.
Treacherous yes, traitorous no. Tell me where Stemmons’ files are.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ll bring them to you.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: You’re not leaving here Klein.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Then like I said: you only get me.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of
LAPD’s Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between
his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots.
Then I leave LA for good.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: What happened to Wilhite?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Like Sanderline Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite’s
body by noon tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No more tails. I don’t want anyone else
incriminated.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I get a copy of that?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: After a judge signs it. Now
Leave.</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: We wait for him to deliver, then we
arrest him. You never saw that agreement.</p>
<p><strong>deputy #1</strong>: Tail him?</p>
<p><strong>welles noonan</strong>: No. Let him get comfortable…let him
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Running out of room, time, both. Trapped between
Bradley and Noonan.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I know what Feds look like – those were Feds
with Junior…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah and they made me leaving the scene. Had to
barter out.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Barter what?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My Testimony. I signed a Federal Witness
Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: It’s bullshit. Noonan’s got no intention of
honoring it. They want Stemmons files though. I think Junior’s been
working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What did you do to his place? Nice quiet
neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: He had a hand grenade tied to that. How much
longer do you need?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Few more hours. Maybe. Junior didn’t skimp on
this thing. I gotta bore right through the face plate. You got some time
now, why don’t you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe
broad.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You read my mind.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …tell me if I’m being too rough.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Tell me anything. Tell me everything.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Where would I start?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Why here?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Why L.A.? Why is anybody here? Want
the rest of the world to know who they are.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: No…I don’t think so. I just love it.
I grew up in Seattle. My aunt, every week, she’d take me to the
movies.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: The idea that you can outlive
yourself…that a part of you goes on, long after you’re gone. Sounds
silly doesn’t it? `Attack of the Atomic Vampires’ being-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -your ticket to immortality?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Hughes told me he could get me in
for this screen test two years ago. Movie with Gregory Peck at
Universal. He thought he was humoring me…until I got it. They offered me
the role…there in the room. So Howard, who I’m sure never thought in a
million years I’d land that part, makes some phone calls and just like
that they don’t want me anymore. Nobody calls now. I can’t get in to see
any studio casting people. He’s ruined me in those circles.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And you still want it-</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: -bad enough to put on a silly
cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound
decent.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits.
That’s…dedication.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Or desperation. Depends on the
day.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: I’ll get there though. I’ll get
there.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dwight Gillette.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: He asked me to take his
<code>niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... Why do they call you</code>Enforcer?’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ve killed 44 men.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit –
mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: `For profit – mostly.’</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m not much good.</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The Knife ain’t there. File on top of that
middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.’</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Junior documented everything like a fucking
Monk. Like here: `has evidence’ you murdered Sanderline Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You been up all night?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He’s got
every goddamn address of everybody you know… And you should’ve told me
about the Bledsoe broad.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: There’s nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp
Gillette. I’m no legal mind like you, but I’ll bet a murder beef would
violate her morals clause quick. Collect the rest of your money.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I don’t want it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Then give that five grand back.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior stole it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: People are gonna start lining-up to see you
bleed, Pal.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Your young partner called me at my home,
early this morning.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Heavily inebriated. Speaking inarticulately
of <code>betrayal,' &amp; how the LAPD was set to be</code>blitzed by
justice.’ Is this the `bind’ of which we spoke earlier?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: And his apartment – there was some type of
disturbance? A fire?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: That’s why I needed his address. I was trying to
help him before something like this happened. The kid snapped-in-half
Fritz. He’s literally lost it. He say anything else to you?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Only that he was in possession of materials
that might deeply damage Chief Bradley…and yourself.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Like I said Fritz, he’s flipped his lid. I don’t
want to go to Internal Affairs but I’m afraid Junior might’ve forced
just that.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Let me try to locate the lad first Dave. Be
a shame to ruin such a young career so soon.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Be careful Fritz. He’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in the LAPD,
digging. He’ll find Junior and when he does he’ll find Ainge…then
Glenda…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Noonan’s deadline lapsed ten minutes ago. An
official fugitive from justice now.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley doing damage control, the forced
relocation of the Ravine’s immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy.
Reuben Ruiz forced along as the token Mexican mouthpiece.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -this area has long been rife with crime
and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible
blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they
deserve. Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this
horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.’</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney Noonan has
promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury
on-</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack
politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has
grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police
Department.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll leave you
with Reuben Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Your subpoena hasn’t caught up to me yet,
Chief…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hurwitz Holdings.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of
Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called
Hurwitz Holdings. If the Dodgers move here the value of the land
booms…you could sell it off for a fortune – or hang onto it and make
even more. The parking lots alone would make you all
multi-millionaires.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Word gets out that the three City Officials who
were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint – might
color public opinion. Might color it even more to know that the LAPD’s
Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land
from the biggest dope dealer in town.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of
this land. You didn’t give a shit about solving his disappearance. You
were worried that your real estate deal was going south.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His
`excellent ratings’ didn’t stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure
and doing his own investigation.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Why would he investigate me?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: That was stapled to the cover. Why would Noonan
worry about a Turd like me now…when a high profile target like you can
be taken down.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Where is Stemmons?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: No idea. If you haven’t spoken to Internal
Affairs today, I’m sure they’ve called. Junior’s apartment caught fire.
Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up- -and anyone he’s got with
him.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I’ll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a
known deviant targeting kindergarten children.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Now, quid pro quo…you subpoenaed Wilhite
too.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: How do y-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -don’t worry `how.’ Why?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You’re going after Narco yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will
redeem the whole. I’ll prove that Police can police themselves-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -so you show-up Noonan…co-opt his crusade and
condemn your own before he can…Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: No Cop will testify against other Cops.
This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And how. So where do we go now Chief?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: There are other forces at work here…faces
we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -that report is only useful to Noonan now.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: No. It ensures our mutual destruction
should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I
know you won’t do until you figure out how it will best benefit you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: A mistake to underestimate me now Chief. The
price to keep your secrets is steep…and you’re going to pay up.
Soon.</p>
<p><strong>six-pack</strong>: Something in your trunk smells to high
hell Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dead body.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done.
Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left…make them now.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Fucking Christ. You can’t keep that car in the
garage, the smell’s coming into the house.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Open the windows.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s not gonna help.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over
the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What do you got in there?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m going to work.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You taking her?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m taking her.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hughes.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: This is almost over Pete – I’ll give Milteer the
five-grand back.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s more than that.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’ll square it. It’s my thing.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That you made mine.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Look as bad as I’ve ever seen you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Things are as bad as they’ve ever been…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley’s Third Party Theory. Everything linked:
Wilhite, Magdalena, the Ravine…I’ve got my own theories…and the one that
sticks is the one I pray I’m wrong about.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Klein.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: MOTHERFUCKER – you better meet me!
That Cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked! I got the
knife. I got Ainge-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: How’d you get this number Junior?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I got everything on you! AND
I’M</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -you’re a broom-closet Queer. Your career is
over.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: The knife for MY file on Bradley. I
know you already burned that Whore’s but don’t think I can’t re- do
investigations.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You snitch to Noonan, then what?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Fuck Noonan. I got stronger
Allies.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Who? The Soviets?</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Meet me in one hour with that file,
Fern Dell Park-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -Where you used to snag fruits for Vice? A
volunteer gig I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: Be there with Bradley’s file or I
scratch your scabby Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -I see anybody near there Junior, the deals off
and I gift that file to Bradley to fuck you with-</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: -Dave?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Glenda?</p>
<p><strong>glenda bledsoe</strong>: Sorry…you gave me this number…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Jesus…hey…</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Who were you talking-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -no, no. It’s nothing. I had a phone call, just
before yours.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Was it him? The Cop you were telling me
about?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I don’t want you to worry. I’m handling it. But
I might send my friend Pete out there.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: You don’t think it’s safe?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’d just rather have someone there with you.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: I wish you would’ve woken me up this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m better-looking in low light, I didn’t want
to blow it for myself.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Stay by the phone.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Where’s the knife.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Turn your lights off…and just come out and talk
to me…Fritz.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Third Party Confirmed…I fucking knew it.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Not much with these sub-rosa things…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I thought it was Noonan tailing me.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Bradley’s greatest stroke was enlisting you
to his side.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: When did you know?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I didn’t. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up
all over Hector’s disappearance and Wilhite wouldn’t have the muscle or
the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself…you knew about
Bradley trying to buy him out?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: He was offering to exonerate Hector and
clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of
his decision…</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: …to accept Bradley’s deal…</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: …and although the terms of that deal worked
well for him. I found them less than favorable…</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human
Vice. These are slums I run &amp; profit from. If these slums suddenly
become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere…that crime goes
elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Bradley…you two got greed in common.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That’s how
you were operating him.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I was aware of his sexual predilections.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …and someone else’s…</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: We share an eye for human frailty and we’re
both born blackmailers Dave. I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness
for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And now you’re his only ally. This sad queer who
fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds. So you get this file
to battle Bradley with. What’s Junior get in return?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I don’t want to watch…I’m sorry it came to
this, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>junior stemmons</strong>: I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth
it…’cuz she’s still fucked. For a crooked cop, you think small.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Whatever moves I had left…I just made.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: This isn’t it!</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Poorly played Dave…poorly played…</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Could I talk you into something? Cut you in
on something?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Won’t work for me Fritz.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Give me a minute then?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Fritz Koenig.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Dead. Along with Wilhite, Junior…and Hector
Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: To collect. I have the things you need to
destroy Noonan’s play. These same things can be used to destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Things like?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Stemmons files…and Wilhite’s body. He committed
suicide after you subpoenaed him.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: This body is in your possession?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: And it’s what you need to burn Narco to the
ground…but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and
the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop.
Well. The word `Cataclysmic’ comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: What will this cost?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in
perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: What’d you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe?
I’m about to disappear for good, and you’re gonna fund my new life. You
can’t counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world. I’ll
hold that over your head for the rest of your life. Renege on our deal
and it won’t matter if it’s tomorrow or ten years from now…I’ll fry you
with that file. I’m officially outta time now Chief. Call it.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Wilhite’s body…Bury it.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Shaking to see her, touch her…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: You go to bed drunk, or just been up all
night.</p>
<p><strong>klein</strong>: Where’s Glenda, is she asle-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time
the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: The harder you hit him the quicker I say
`stop’ – and cease that absurd crying.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: -touch me and he dies.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: Kick him-kick him-kick him.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: -you may stop. Howard determined that this
was the price for your time together.</p>
<p><strong>milteer</strong>: You still have a job.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …I’m sorry Dave…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I put you here…that Powerhawk-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: -there’s a body in the trunk-</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: -burn it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m so sorry….</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Let me take you to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: We’d never make it inside.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: I’m worried.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I’m through the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Was I worth this?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Whatever the cost.</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: Just like that then?</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My deadline with Noonan: two days old. He and
Bradley playing chess by press release.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Cop-killings clear the way for Bradley’s “Redeem
The Ravine’ mandate. Dodger Stadium construction moves forward. Captain
Dan Wilhite and Hector Magdalena. Missing. APB’s issued. Bradley’s press
fodder cast them as `outlaw cop and drug dealer’ who most likely fled to
Mexico. Narco under a full-blown, Bradley-led investigation.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: …police unit run amok, who’s long tradition
of graft, does not extend to other divisions of the LAPD…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: I haven’t loved you long enough to leave it all
behind…Too many enemies. Too many ways for you to get hurt. Too close to
me…a decision that will haunt me the rest of my days…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: “My Heaven: the hours I had with you. My Hell:
the years ahead, without. Someday I’ll see you before you even know I’m
looking.”</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …be nice to be in with a billionaire who’s got
a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on short notice…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Pete’s penance beating built me a brand new
face…nobody gives me a second glance…not even the cops I recognize.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: My will to remember. My confession complete.
Still not enough. Post-scripts.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding her name.
Only a photograph, yellowed with years-passed, reminding me of
everything I never was. Then a week-old Times at the place I buy coffee.
Her picture sees me before I realize she’s looking. Her Face
eternal-beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>me</strong>: …and it asked me to revoke our time apart,
redeem it…tell her anything…tell her everything…</p>
</body>
