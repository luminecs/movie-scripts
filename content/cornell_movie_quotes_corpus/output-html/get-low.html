<h1 id="get-low">get-low</h1>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: Just a boy, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>6 series: 6</strong>: 7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at
the road and posts a 7 fresh one:‘No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule’.
Bush checks the road in both directions. All clear for now. 8 Bush
splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8 dozes in the
shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn into his road, right past
his new sign. He glances at his shotgun leaning against the shack. The
Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees Bush swinging the
axe and approaches with trepidation.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Mornin’, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Hard life if you can’t read..</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Pardon? I’m uh, Reverend Gus Horton, sir,
how you doing? Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at
Horton.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t need saving, preacher.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has passed on,
sir. His funeral is tomorrow and I thought you might want to know
since..</p>
<p>****: What got him?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Just got old, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Yeah, well.. Bush returns to chopping wood.
Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Mr. Starke told me that you and him ran away
from home when you were 6 years old. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I talked him into it. Bush doesn’t turn, just
keeps chopping.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Well.. anyway.. I.. alright.. Horton shrugs,
get in his car, and leaves. Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved
piece goes flying.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well hell..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Always thought you’d go first.. White as
cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running out of oil, the light
fading fast to darkness. Thoughts tumble through his mind, troubling
him, stirring the dark waters of memory.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Ahh, don’t look so disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You better not. Mule looks back, sees an apple
in Bush’s hand, and stops.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: And coffee when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Buddy?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Oh! Hello.. Horton comes to Bush but Bush
ignores him and keeps critically looking around.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: What can I do for you, sir? Suddenly BUDDY
and KATHRYN ROBINSON enter from the vestibule with their new BABY. In
their own world, and not realizing that there is anyone in the chapel,
Kathryn picks some lint from Buddy’s jacket. He catches her fingers and
kisses them. Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I can wait. Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and
double-take Bush. Buddy nods to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into
the vestibule to give Bush and Horton privacy.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: It’s alright, have a seat. Bush sits down
uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew in front of him and
twists around to face him. The wintry light from the near window washes
over them.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: What’s on your mind, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Bout time for me to get low.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Get what?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Down to business Bush reaches into his
overalls and puts a balled-up wad of MONEY on the pew. Horton’s eyes
bulge.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Need a funeral. Horton looks up from the
money.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: For who?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Me. Buddy peers around from the vestibule,
listening, curious as hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: For you? You want to buy a funeral for
you?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Am I not talking right?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: No, yes, I’m sorry. Are you sick sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Everybody dies.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: True, but..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I don’t take care of my bones it won’t get
done, will it?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: All right, I see. Well the church can help
you get your affairs in order, arrange a service.. Horton glances at the
strange wad of money again.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What would you say?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: A eulogy? I.. don’t know. What do you want
me to say?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Say what you’d say right now to my face.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Well. I uh, I don’t know much about you,
Mr. Bush. I mean, I’ve heard stories but..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What stories? Bush leans in and stares into
Horton. It feels like everything in the world stops dead. Buddy peeks in
again, this time Kathryn peeks too.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Just stories.. .you know, people
talking.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What kind of stories? Say one.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Sir.. my mother used to say that gossip is
the devil’s radio..</p>
<p>****: .not that she didn’t play that radio at full volume now and
then, bless her heart, but.. .what matters when you come to the end of
your life is that you’re ready for the next one. Have you made peace
with God, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: I paid. Horton has no idea what Bush means.
He looks at the money, back at Bush.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Well.. you can’t buy forgiveness, Mr. Bush.
It’s free. But you do have to ask for it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Nothing in this world is free, preacher.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: That was, uh, different.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I heard such awful things about him when I
was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: My mother probably told you some of them.
Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing at the baby.
Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..</p>
<p><strong>bonnie</strong>: What are you doing, son? Now Tom is scared
to death that Bush is going to tell on him. Bonnie doesn’t like this
staring match at all.</p>
<p><strong>bonnie</strong>: Empty those cans in your daddy’s truck and
get back in here. Now. Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the
hook. Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie hesitates
then goes back into the diner just as… .CARL , his sidekick, GARY, and
two other MEN come across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule
slurping coffee from the big tin cup.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Look at that. A mule drinking coffee!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Finally found somebody that likes Bonnie’s
coffee. As they move past, they see Bush standing there..</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Ya’ll better hush, that’s old Bush. Carl
eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as they head into
the diner. Carl stops.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey..</p>
<p>****: I’m talking to you.. Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses
some over nonchalantly in Bush’s direction. Bush ignores it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We know about you. You stay out of this diner.
There’s women and children here and we don’t want you around them. Bush
stands to mount up, never turning around.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You better hear me. I see you here again,
I’ll.. Hey! Hey! Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Shit.. Carl moves up to try and calm him.. .as
Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a GASH in Mule’s
hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly surrendering. As Carl
steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart and hits Carl in the
chest. Air explodes from Carl as he gasps with pain. Before he can move,
Bush hits him again in the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has
no air. Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
exact same place. Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees
Bush towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him. It
has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to Carl.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Daddy! Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run
toward Bush.</p>
<p><strong>bonnie</strong>: Stop it!! Get away! Gary, the Worker burst
from the diner but see the brake handle in Bush’s hand and slow down.
Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in tears, and
now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away.. Gary and the others slowly
move toward Bush. More patrons step out from the diner. Buddy races up,
sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs the reins and leads Mule
down Main street, still holding the brake handle.</p>
<p>****: I’ll kill him! Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father’s hatred.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Frank? There was a fight. It was..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: .let me guess. Hmm. Carl?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well yeah but this time it was with that old
man Bush.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Old man?</p>
<p>****: Is there a body?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No, the old man did the beating. Never seen
anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Social event of the year and I missed it.
Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no southern
accent and doesn’t look small town.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Read the paper today? Something strange is
happening in the world right now.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: People are dying in bunches. Everywhere. But
here. He puts the paper down and studies his socks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wonder what the odds are of a funeral home
going broke? I mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you
can’t make that work, it’s got to be you right? And yet.. I don’t know..
what do you do when people won’t die?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die;
they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We get it done down here, we’re just not in a
hurry about it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s them or us. Frank sighs and stares
forlornly out at a casket.</p>
<p>****: I might know someone who is looking for a funeral. Frank’s eyes
crawl over to him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How much did he have?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It was all wadded up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Ooo, hermit money. That’s good. Buddy sees
Bush’s signs.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There it is..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ve been wanting a shot at sales..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: As of right now, you’re on commission.
Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer. Buddy
hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’d feel better if you’d go too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No doubt but if you don’t do this by
yourself, you won’t know if you’re any good. And you’ll never be any
good if you don’t know you are. Go get him!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hello? Nothing. He shoots a look back to the
hearse - miles away, and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to
the window and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
slide away..</p>
<p><strong>click.</strong>: Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on
the ground behind him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy’s
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Want to see in my house, do you? BOOM! Bush
blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at Buddy’s head.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: How’s it look? Buddy closes his eyes, his last
words are for his wife..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh, Katie.. It makes Bush peek out from
behind the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: You was at the church with your wife and
baby. Buddy opens his eyes and can’t believe he is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What the hell you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What? They stand there while Buddy
thinks..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh yeah, I heard.. you wanted a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Funeral?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at.. .Quinn
Funeral Home. I thought I could help you. Bush glances at his blown out
window: ‘Damn’. He lowers his gun, walks up onto the porch.</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: You like rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What? Bush goes inside. Buddy looks
desperately back at the hearse but can’t see Frank. He doesn’t know
whether to run for it or not.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Sit down. There is only chair at the table so
Buddy dumps the glass off a small stool under the window and sits down
low. The wonder of not being dead makes him look at everything with new
eyes. On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE emerging
from a block of wood.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: It’s how you put things together, see? Some
things go, some things never will. Indians said that everything spoke to
them. That’s how they made medicine and knew what to eat. Things talked
to them clear as we talk. You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I.. I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: If you don’t listen you won’t hear nothing.
Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down. Buddy is so low he
can look under the table and sees how the table legs run right into the
top without screws or nails.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Did you make this furniture, sir? Never seen
any like it. Can’t even tell what’s holding it up.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Magic. Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious.
The word lingers. Finally..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want to plan
for a funeral service, which I hope will be a long long time away, we’d
treat you with respect and offer a good..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What’d everybody say about what happened in
town?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: That crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a
man to death for no reason? That it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There’s two sides to every story. As Bush
puts some rabbit on Buddy’s old yellowed plate..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: People say that. But they don’t mean it. They
think what they think and they don’t want to know anything else.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yes, sir, but I think people are so scared of
what they don’t know that they make things up to feel better about
it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Like life after dying. Heaven.</p>
<p>****: I hope that part’s true, don’t you?</p>
<p>****: But I don’t think we know the actual truth about much of
anything. I know I don’t. I’m just guessing most of the time. Bush gives
Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the rabbit. Fearing the
worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes a cautious bites and mutters
with shocked surprise..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Lord, that’s good..</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: You boys been coming out here to throw rocks
through my window for 20-30 years.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I never..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Ya’ll know lots of stories about me?</p>
<p>****: Yes, sir, I guess, but..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Tell one.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’d rather not. Bush eases forward, his eyes
slit. The old Bush is back.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I rather you did.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well. When I was kid I heard you killed some
men in a fist fight.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Is that all? Bush leans back stone-faced. In
the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule
on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born
from the rough block. It makes him smile. But when he glances back, Bush
is staring a hole through him.</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: What’s your name again?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Buddy Robinson, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: Well, if I need you – I know where you are.
It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops eating and
realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that he’s been
dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh yes Ma’am, I do respect your wishes but
you see..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: .state law requires.. No ma’am, we can’t bury
him under the house.. There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to
get it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well just for argument’s sake, Ma’am, how
would we get the casket under the house? No casket?</p>
<p>****: Would you like to come in, sir?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But you have to have a container of some
kind, Ma’am for decency and uh, sanitation. Bush enters the Funeral
Home. As Buddy starts to close the door, Bush catches it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Leave it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes, Ma’am, but there’s lots of natural
things that aren’t decent. He did what?! Good God. No, Ma’am, I didn’t
know that about your husband. Well, yeah now I understand why you want
him under the house but still.. The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush
walks in.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush. Frank takes a quick
swallow from his cup to fortify himself, then jumps up, smiling, and
goes to Bush with his hand out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee? As Bush
shakes Frank’s hand, he stares into him, taking everything in, his
bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath his suit, his breath. Frank
feels downright naked.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You from anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A little bit of everywhere, I guess. Get him
a chair, Buddy! Buddy stands behind the waiting chair.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How can we help you, sir? Bush gives Buddy a
look, then looks back at Frank who steadfastly refuses to look at the
ball of money.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I’m after a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Boy, are you in luck.</p>
<p>****: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Solid pecan, steel handles.. Bush eyes it,
repulsed.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Mr. Bush is an amazing carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Forget the box. What else?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whatever you want, flowers..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Burial plot..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A service?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Party.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: A party.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What kind of party?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life,
Frank looks at Buddy. Then years of honed instincts surge back to
life.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can do that.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his
desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You will be, I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I want to be there now.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You want to be at your funeral.. party..
alive? But.. it’s not a funeral if you’re not, you know, deceased..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hold on now, it’s a detail, we can look at
it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Pretty big detail.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So you’d like to have a funeral party while
you’re alive so you can go?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes. Buddy is lost.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of
list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Sit down. Buddy sits right down.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I want everybody to come who’s got a story to
tell about me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Say again.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That probably covers 4 counties.. Bush shoots
him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks about how great an
outdoor life would be.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the
party.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, sir, the thing is, how would you get
people to come and tell stories about you that I’m guessing might get
them, you know.. shot? Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out.
Now all Frank can see is the money, leaving.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know what, you go ahead, don’t worry
about it, we’ll think of something. A couple of ideas just came to
me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Felix?! Feigning deafness, Bush walks on.
Sensing something, Kathryn takes the baby so Mattie can go after
him.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Felix! Say hello to me! Frank, eyes wide
with surprise, mouths, “Felix?”. Bush’s shoulder hunch then fall as he
turns. He looks into her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes
and voice are soft.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Hey Mattie. Buddy comes out, surprised to see
Mattie and Bush together. Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn
steers them back inside to give Mattie privacy.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Heard you moved off.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I’ve been back a while.</p>
<p>****: Well.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You look like you always did. He abruptly rips
himself away and is gone.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How would she know him?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s none of our business.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So? We got to know. Kathryn shakes her head
and goes back outside. FRANK has another look at Mattie then lets the
curtain fall back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: See the size of that thing?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you mean, what? Goddamn ball of
money! He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears, we’re gonna give
it to him.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made one
December, in Chicago, with wind blowing so hard up my ass I was farting
snow flakes in July so don’t tell me we can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s the last “but” I want to hear out of
you. You’re a salesman now, sell!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She called him Felix.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: A thousand years ago he was the most
interesting man I’d ever met.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: He was. And I don’t mean just the way he
looked.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Oh no, listen, he was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p>****: Most people are just laid out nice and simple, you know? You
always know what they’re thinking and where you are with them. But he
was this.. big old cave that went deeper and deeper. You’d never get to
the end of him.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Good Lord, you had a crush on him!</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: All the girls did. I know he’s something
wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble
now but there’s still nobody like him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We have a plan. All we need is a little bit
of your time.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Seeing it is better than hearing about it.
Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: How much is it gonna cost?</p>
<p>****: Did you say anything about money? I didn’t say anything about
money.</p>
<p>****: If we can’t get you what you want you don’t owe us
anything.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: It moves, don’t it?</p>
<p>****: This is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Fancy car for the dead.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Didn’t buy it for them.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We say that funerals are “For the Living” but
we forget what that means sometimes, I guess.</p>
<p>****: I was thinking about your funeral party before I went to sleep
last night and I think I understand it a little now. When I was a kid,
my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral
home… they did the impossible as far as I was concerned. I don’t know
what I would’ve done without them. And I remember wishing that my mother
and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything. Frank is
hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush glances softly at
Buddy then looks out the side window at the world rushing by too fast.
All at once he gives in to it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’s he going?</p>
<p>****: I wish you wouldn’t do that yet. Bush gives him the hairy
eyeball then speaks to Mr. Tollerude, a clear threat.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t leave me naked.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs cut you
want after we take your picture, I’ll pay for it. Mr. Tollerude doesn’t
know whether to cut or not.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Why you want my picture made?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s what we’re trying to tell you. We’re
gonna run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of
you.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: And you want me to look like this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’s how people recognize you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you want as many people to come as
possible so..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: So a crazy old nutter draws more.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Basically. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Do you ever say what you mean? Bush rips the
bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Take it. I’d go see that.</p>
<p>****: Damn. You look pretty good.. Bush suddenly gets up and nods at
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: He’s paying. As Bush blows out the door,
Mr. Tollerude leans against the chair with relief.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Son of a bitch, it’s almost worth it.</p>
<p>****: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I wouldn’t know you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Maybe the Devil won’t either. Might work
out.</p>
<p>****: Where’s the shoes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, normally people don’t wear shoes in a
casket so.. .what are you, about a 10D?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes
to the grave. How you set for underwear?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t wear none.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One question too many.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t mean to be nosey but uh.. how do you
know Mattie?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: She’s a peach. Frank and Buddy cut Bush a
look. He looks ahead.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: We had a go. Frank nearly drives off the
road.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: “The Lord loves a cheerful giver..”</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Oh please.. you think the Lord’s taking
sides in a poker game in a funeral home? Horton shrugs and points to the
divine evidence.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If He is, the Divine’s cheating.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt
myself.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I would have turned down your loan if you were
my own dear mother, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You made my point and don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Jesus, would you two stop it! You’re worse
than two old women.. Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in
his temper for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
has only a couple of dollars left.</p>
<p>****: What were you doing with that old bastard in town today,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting him a
haircut..on credit. Frank shoots him a look.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Took out ads in a bunch of papers too,
something about a party?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: God, I love small towns.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Who are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That hermit, what’s his name..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: “Felix” Bush.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: You’re giving him a party?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A funeral party.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Whatever you’re drinking is not being good
to you at all.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What the hell is a funeral party?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, the man wants to be at his own funeral.
What can I say? I’d like to be at my funeral so I could tell my ex-wife
to kiss my..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: What makes you think she’d show up for
you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Because, Dear, vultures are constitutionally
unable to ignore the dead. Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: It’s that big wad of money of his you’re
after. There is a crack in Ray’s disinterest that he tries to hide.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What money is that?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Felix has money? Everyone is looking at
Frank but he shuffles the cards.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: He came to see me, wanting a funeral, had a
big old greasy ball of money. Talked like he thought he could buy his
way to heaven with it.</p>
<p>****: How much has he got? Maybe he can. Hearing that Bush wants or
needs a real funeral Mattie is suddenly truly concerned.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Is he sick, Gus? Horton shrugs. Frank notes
the concern and doesn’t like it. Carl coughs and his ribs make him break
out into a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll tell you one damn thing, ain’t nobody
gonna go to a funeral for that son of a bitch. Mattie gives Carl a
look</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Language..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They might. He’s inviting everyone who has a
story about him to come. You could tell about him kicking your ass,
Carl. Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Old man is going to ride the Weird Train right
into the ground, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Wouldn’t you like to know what everybody says
about you behind your back, Ray? Yeah, probably not.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: I already know way more about people than I
need to.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Or want to.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s play some cards.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh for God’s sake, face it Frank, you’re broke.
This is not about cards. It’s a declaration meant to embarrass Frank in
front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes on him as he starts to pull
off his watch. Ray waves it off.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Please. I’ve won that 4 times already.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s who has it last that counts.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Say what you want but if there hadn’t been
anybody there the other day he would’ve killed me. And I guarantee you
it wouldn’t have been his first time. It sounds true and everyone is
quiet except Mattie.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Everybody knows you started it. Don’t look
at me like that. I remember when you were born. You were the sweetest
little boy. What is wrong with you? Momentarily shamed, Carl’s face
softens and we can see a better man there. He struggles to hold on to it
but..</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I made a mistake. But there’s a line.. and he
crossed it.. and everybody knows that too. Ya’ll go on and have a party
with the devil for his money but I’ll dance on his grave someday. Carl
snatches his few dollars up and heads out.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: You kind of hate to admit it when it comes
to Carl but he’s got a point. You don’t know what Bush is doing. What if
he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun
on them?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: He wouldn’t..</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: I looked in his eyes. The truth is nobody
knows what he’s capable of. Maybe even he doesn’t know. She looks into
him. Frank starts to deal the cards.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go ahead and lay your watch down, Frank. But I
am going to keep it this time, alright, on principle.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I got an idea. Let’s try something
different.</p>
<p>****: The cards in your sock? Leave’em there. Everyone freezes. Ray
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you trying to pull now?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You really think you’re that good that nobody
sees?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sees what?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You cheat at everything you do. Even at the
bank, you loan people just enough to get’em deeper in so you can
foreclose on them.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You are a pathetic man. And a goddamn..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Am I? Then stand up and roll down your socks.
Stand up or I’ll stand you up. Ray looks around the table and suddenly
realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank’s
chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll walk you home.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: No. Thank you.</p>
<p>****: You sure? You’re not going to play anymore, are you?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Thank you for inviting me
though.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry about the..we don’t always fight,
okay, we do, but he’s had that coming for..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: It’s not that. I just..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You came because you don’t know what to do
with yourself. I slept on the same side of the bed my whole life, right?
But after my wife left me, I switched sides, just like that, and never
been able to go back.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: When someone you love is gone, you can pour
everything, even a lifetime of things into the place where they were but
it’s still always empty.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: ’Night. He stares after her, wishing that
she could see him the way he sees her.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I didn’t hear him wake up.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He didn’t.</p>
<p>****: Everything’s all right, hon.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m glad you don’t know how quick it can
change. She gently kisses his arm and the baby’s head. Buddy looks at
her, haunted by the very possibility of their absence.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Good Lord. Have you completely lost your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>40a.</strong>: MATTIE Straighten up for heaven’s sake before
somebody throws a net over you! But she smiles in spite of herself,
glances around to see if anyone was watching and moves discretely on. As
she does we see that she was talking to a striking WANTED POSTER of a
wild man sitting in front of a pond, a swan, and a bridge. The text
reads:</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Friends, we have a treat for you today on
WCGM. Our special guest is going to tell us about an event that everyone
is talking about. And here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the mysterious hermit
of Caleb County! How are you today, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I am. Bush is surprised by the sound of his
own voice.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: So tell us, sir, exactly how did you come
up with the idea of having a funeral party before you die?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I dreamed it.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Why would I make that up? Two seconds of dead
air as the announcer finds his feet.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Okay. Now I have to say that you don’t
look quite like you do on the posters.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I got pruned.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Well, you’re a bit of a local legend,
sir. I was a little nervous about our interview. I’ve heard some pretty
wild stories..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Well uh, just.. from what I understand,
you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it. Is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You come and tell yours.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Thank you. Now how long have you been
living out there by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: 40 some years.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: 40 years with nobody to talk to?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: First 38 are the hardest.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: But why would you do that, Mr. Bush, shut
yourself off like that? Frank isn’t happy with this but Buddy wants to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Come to the funeral and maybe you’ll find
out.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: You heard it here on WCGM, folks, find
out the answer to the mystery February 16..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense.
What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Gonna be a drawing.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: What kind of drawing, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the
funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300
acres of timber that hasn’t been touched in 40 years. Mattie
accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: For 5 dollars?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank’s
eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps! Buddy looks
oddly perplexed and sad.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: You heard him! If you want a chance to
win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars,
send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. Frank Quinn at
Quinn Funeral Home. As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head
in time with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth.</p>
<p>****: I could almost kiss you on the mouth!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: I’ll take a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’re betting on a man dying..</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: I didn’t mean it like..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, it’s his idea! They look at Bush who has
taken off the headset and looking at it like he wants to take it
home.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s what you want, right?</p>
<p>****: Buy a ticket, son.</p>
<p><strong>insert photo</strong>: The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stares at us
as we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are now looking at the identical photo
tacked to Bush’s wall.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Mattie?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Felix? Mattie enters, straining to see into
the barn. Her eyes adjust to find him standing near Mule. She is
startled and pleased by his new do.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Look at you. I wondered if you were still
under that beard.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Wasn’t nowhere else to go.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I heard you on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: You’ve gotten downright chatty.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I reckon so.</p>
<p>****: This is nice. I drove by a few times after I got back but..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Do you want me to?</p>
<p><strong>keeper, charlie, maude.</strong>: Bush is squatting down
staring at the markers. Mattie stands close beside him. Since his
attention is elsewhere she looks at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is
full of questions, old and new.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You always know where you stand with a dog.
Want to lay here with them someday if they’ll have me.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: It really is beautiful. Probably looked like
this everywhere a hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You leave things alone, they know what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Like you?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: No, Ma’am. I don’t know what to do about
anything much.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: You’ve been alone a long time.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Some people are more suited to it than others,
I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: That’s funny cause I never thought that it’d
suit you. I knew you wouldn’t be like anybody else but.. no one to talk
to, no one to.. be with.. never. He looks into her then looks away at
something.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: How you sleeping these days, girl?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: How am I what?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You sleep good?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: No, not lately. How’d you know? He veers off
the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back to her.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Chamomile, it’s good when the nights get long.
Helps you nod off. She takes it and smiles up at him.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Want to go on a ways?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Would you stay for supper?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I don’t want to be any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much
trouble, Girl.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Alright then. He holds out his arm.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Better stay close, some big old wild cats been
eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: .or maybe it was me.. She snorts and slaps his
arm but doesn’t let go..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: You always were good with your hands. He
puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You still play the piano?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I teach a few girls.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I got a good feeling when you played. Remember
that time you was playing and the lamp burned out? And you went right on
in the dark? I hear that song sometimes at night. She shrugs shyly and
sips the tea. Seconds tick by.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Sure is quiet out here.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I said it’s.. I tried to write you at times
but I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well. I heard you married.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: He was a Doctor; a real good man. We lived
in St. Louis for awhile. He died unexpectedly about a year ago. I came
back here because.. I have no idea why.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: The list of people who are gone is getting
longer and longer and sometimes I feel like all I’m doing is waiting for
my name to come up.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You have a tender heart, always did. She gives
him a curious look.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You can’t wait for anything, Mattie. Close
your eyes, hold your breath.. stay in one spot your whole life, but
you’re still moving, like the world’s moving under you. There’s no
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: And there’s no getting over some things
either, is there?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Reckon not, Little Bit.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Little Bit?! Oh my God, nobody’s called me
that in.. But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush’s bed. Bush is
stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but it is too late.
She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp light and
stares into it as if it is a mirage that will disappear if she blinks.
Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured mask. A
strangled sob escapes her. He gets up and stands there staring at the
floor. Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out the
door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands with his head
down, staring into oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus, kid!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah! But, but it’s not our money.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well yeah, no, but some of it’s gonna be!
We’re putting this thing on! Frank rips open two more envelopes and
dollar bills rain down to the floor. He’s beside himself. Buddy eyes him
warily.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He should be here. I’m gonna go get him. They
lock eyes. Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know exactly how much your land’s
worth but looks to me like you could get maybe 10 times that or more. I
don’t know what to do with it. I mean it’s yours to do with what you
want but I’m getting a little nervous about it. Never thought I’d see
enough money to make me nervous. We should probably talk about the price
for everything, the clothes, the ads, the food and drink for the party,
the music.. our fee for everything, we’ll be fair about that, I’m not
worried about it. Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the
room.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What do you think, boy? Buddy jerks, looks at
Frank, at Bush.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Money makes people do funny things. Frank
scowls.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I think you should probably put it in the
bank, sir.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No! Ray is not.. I mean, if it was my money
I’d put it in a bank out of town so everyone didn’t know my business.
This bank here, you can’t trust, that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Can I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every name, every dollar, is right there!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Not what I asked.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve done a hell of a job for you. I don’t
see why..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Mr. Bush, I didn’t mean to imply..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Hush.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket
watches pinned to the inside of my coat. I’m not ashamed of it. I don’t
rob banks, don’t cheat at cards, and I sleep all right the nights I
sleep. What was the question..?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: They goddamn.. He nods at the money and
suddenly becomes the “other” Bush.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Take out for the expenses you’ve already had
and give me the receipts. As the bills come in for things, give them to
me and I’ll pay them. Put this money in a box and the boy and I’ll take
it someplace in the morning. Whatever new comes in, keep it in the
bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there ’till I come get it. After
the party, name a fair price for what you’ve done and we’ll settle
up.</p>
<p>****: I’ll be at the car. After he’s gone, Frank and Buddy stare at
each other.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is it just me or is he extremely fucking
articulate when he wants to be?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t know who’s selling who what
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s not clear, is it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Not only that but something feels really
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hold on. I told you that you were working on
commission..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, but..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So whatever our end of this is, you get a
piece.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: A piece?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Half. It could help set you up, Buddy. So
whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay? We just
have to close it out. From here on, watch me, do what I do, and we’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He wants you to go with him to take this
money somewhere which means that it’s you he trusts. And that’s fine
because I trust you too. Just don’t trust him, okay?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m lost again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, that funny feeling you have.. I have it
too. And it’s not funny. So go along, be friendly, but that’s it.</p>
<p>****: There’s a euphoria that comes with closing a deal, Buddy, and
the bigger the deal, the higher you get. It’s better than anything.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But the critical time is just before it
closes. It’s like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart.
We’re not going to let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now go. You know.. I always wondered why you
wanted to work here. I thought you could do a lot better. I didn’t know
about your folks, I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Thank you. He goes on. Frank turns and flips
through a large stack of bills, hungrily entranced.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I might have a crying fit coming on too.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Feeling a little weepy.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You boys..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I can maybe do something really good for us,
Katy.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You already have.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I mean, money wise.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: About Mr. Bush?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah. I’m getting half of whatever we make
off of him.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So why aren’t you happy about it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Didn’t know I wasn’t. I was happy for a
minute. And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person’s
death, I don’t know if it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Is it what he wants?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He says it is.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You are not responsible for what other
people do, Buddy, just you.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You’re right. You’re always right.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: At least I am when I’m half naked.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>83 ext/int bush’s shack/hearse - morning 83</strong>: Sitting
in the hearse outside of Bush’s shack, Buddy watches Bush get in the car
with his shotgun. There is a big wooden box of money on the seat between
them. Bush props his shotgun against it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Where to, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: North.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Till I say, son. Buddy gives him an uneasy
look and pulls off down the tree- lined path.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How much further now? Bush waves him on.
Buddy scowls then decides to get serious about this. He presses on the
accelerator and the hearse takes off down the highway.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and
bashful as he drinks her in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Was that you? It was really..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: This is a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view,
forgetting why he is here. She waits it out as long as she can, not sure
how she feels about this adoring look.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Was there something you..?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Uh, yeah.. Help!</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m up to my ears with this funeral and I
thought, you know, we haven’t had time to talk much lately so maybe
you’d like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I’m sorry, I have lessons all afternoon. I
have to get back in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, okay, I just..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Sorry. She slips back inside. Frank stares
at the door.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t say nothing.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You can say “hi”. Bush gets out. Buddy sighs,
mimes “Hi” and gets out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello. Buddy is out of words that he is
allowed to say. He glances at the door but Bush is not coming in.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hi. Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you sure you’re in the right place? Not
expecting a funeral. Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie
squints over then stares at Bush with utter disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Felix?!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Hey, Charlie. They shake hands, then hug.
Buddy is blown away that Bush would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the
church rafters.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Still standing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes. Charlie give Bush a look then holds
out his hand to Buddy again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Reverend Charlie Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: That’s Buddy Robinson, he don’t talk much.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Someone better talk. A ghost pulls up in
the driveway in a hearse, you expect a little bit of a story.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: My hearing is not what it was. It sounded
like you said you want me to preach at your funeral party with you
sitting there?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know I’ve talked to God a lot about you
over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you. Said you
were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble. Buddy
grins.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What would you want me to say at this
funeral?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Whatever you want to, Charlie.</p>
<p>****: Could you give us a minute? Buddy starts to get up.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Sit still. Buddy plops back down.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the matter? You scared to be alone
with me?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: He can hear what’s said. Buddy is surprised
again. So is Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right. After you left here.. did you do
the right thing?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I did.. what I thought was right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You confessed? Asked forgiveness? Bush
looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you tell her, Felix? Charlie sighs,
leans on his knees, and drops his head.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You came a long way for nothing then.
Bush’s eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot. Buddy tenses.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You self-righteous..</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t you dare..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I built my own jail and put myself in it! And
I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no friends!
That’s not enough?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well. Why don’t you come and say that then,
Charlie? Hell, say it all! I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not on your life. The air is so heavy you
can’t breathe it. Bush suddenly gets up and leaves. Buddy starts to
follow. Charlie puts his hand on him to stay. They sit in silence a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How much do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Almost nothing, sir. I just work at the
funeral home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do you know he built this church?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No?!</p>
<p>****: How’s a man like him make something like this? I mean, I know
he’s a good carpenter but this is..</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Magic? Maybe it’s the best of him, maybe he
put his soul into it, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What ya’ll were talking about.. what did he
do? Who was he supposed to tell?</p>
<p>****: For him and God to know I guess. I wish I’d never been put
between them, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>****: I will tell you that he showed up here half dead. I had just
started preaching. Over the next 4 years we built this.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Are you coming to the funeral? Charlie sighs
and looks around. 94A Omitted 94A</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Do you have to?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yes. What are we doing? Since the day you
came into the funeral home, I don’t think anything has happened that you
didn’t want to happen. I just don’t know where it’s going.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: There’s a whole lot of things that you don’t
know. Like what a dog dreams. You can make up a story about him chasing
rabbits but you don’t know if there’s rabbits in there or not. And he
can’t tell you, can he?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Not unless he’s a very special dog. They
snort together.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: People don’t say what they mean either so you
don’t really know any more about them then you do about that dog’s
dream.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: But what..?</p>
<p>****: That time you left my house I saw you stop and look back. You
wanted to know what could make somebody like me. Well here you are, son,
here you are.</p>
<p>****: Where are you..? Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go
out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I better stop and tell Frank we’re back. He’s
probably had 2 or 3 hissy fits by now. Why don’t you stay the night at
the house and I’ll take you home in the morning? The simple kindness
seems to short Bush out. Buddy doesn’t notice, he’s still looking
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well, I… I ain’t stayed with nobody in a.. in
a long while.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’s fine if you want to. Bush looks as if he
might say yes but he NOTICES where the car is passing through and..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Let me out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Stop the car. Bush starts to open the door.
Buddy stops abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You can’t walk. It’s too far.. Bush climbs
out with his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Put the money in a casket.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You might as well get back in, I’ll follow
you all the way.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Get the hell out of here, boy! Buddy’s eyes
are defiant. Bush slams the door and walks away, crossing over a fence
and out into a dark field.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Not responsible. Not responsible. Shit. He
slams the steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Frank? Hello? Mr. Bush? He stuffs the money
into the casket, grabs the candelabra, comes back, seals the lid, and
starts into the office.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: They keep talking about forgiveness.. ask
Jesus for forgiveness.. I never did nothing to Him..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The cut’s not bad but how’s the head? He
moves his finger across Buddy’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Follow it. He looks him over carefully. He’s
had experience.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? You’ll be
okay. Did you see who it was?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No. I was putting the money in.. heard glass
breaking.. locked up the casket quick and.. boom..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You did good.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Doesn’t feel good.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Please, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: What are you doing here? Burned through, a
log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and moves away.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Can I sit a minute? She stares at him then
nods at a chair. She keeps standing behind the other chair. He bends
over the mug and seems to lock up inside.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You want to know why I have your sister’s
picture on my wall?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I’m not stupid, Felix. No, I take that back.
How long was it going on? She was already married when I met you. Were
you just making up to me to get to her? Bush is so still he looks like a
gargoyle.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: If you’re not going to talk, leave.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Can you help who you love? Mattie’s face tells
us that she has asked herself that question many times.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I’ve had 40 years to think about it and I
still don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I don’t know either, so.. Slowly the
gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I want to tell you how it was. If you don’t
want me to, I’ll go. Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes
around and sits down.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Don’t lie to me. When did you take up with
her?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I came to see you and she was there, hanging
clothes on the line with your mama. Bush stares out the window so hard,
Mattie turns to see what he is looking at..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: She turned around.. .and.. I promise you that
I did not know that I had a heart till right then.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You were a fine fine girl. I didn’t know why
you wanted anything to do with me but I was gonna keep coming to see you
’till my luck ran out.</p>
<p>****: And then I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: She was married! And she wasn’t just my
sister, she was my best friend. We told each other everything. I can’t..
how long did it go on?! Bush’s face is so white it looks like a death
mask.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: It’s still going on, Little Bit. Mattie tries
to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it touches her in way that she
is not prepared for. They sit there in silence. She suddenly wipes her
face and scowls.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Did you have anything to do with her death?
The mug trembles. She sees it.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Tell me. Like a fish jerked from the water,
he mouth opens and closes, but nothing comes out.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Felix! Get out of my house! NOW! Bush stands
up quickly and starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: And go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Been there.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: You need to see a doctor.. He raises his
eyes to her but says nothing. They look into each other for a long
moment.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt Mary or
not? Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his shotgun
and goes out the door without a word.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell?! Bush glances at the pistol,
at the open drawers of the cabinet and desk.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: They get it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Buddy sealed it up in a casket. Took a
crack on the head, but..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was an army medic. He’ll be fine. But Bush
is still dark.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But you ought to take those clothes back and
get something in your size.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: They get the whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Brought the money back, huh? Listen, I’ve
been thinking.. What if we had the party at your place? People are going
to want to see the land they’re getting so..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, think about it, we could..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t know that I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Thinking to call it off.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can’t!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Damn well can if I want to.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No no no, it’s in motion!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: If I say no, it’s no. Send the money back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re killing me! I bought things, hired
people.. promised money, everybody in town is hoping to..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I care about this town as much as they care
about me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s what you said you wanted and I’ve busted
my ass for you. So why don’t you want it anymore? You owe me that.</p>
<p>****: It was the end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail party.
But I guess I ain’t got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and I
can’t get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it. And to hell with
me. Bush grabs his shotgun and goes. Frank sits, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Are you having trouble seeing?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I see you’re mad.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m not mad. I’m concerned She shoves the
skillet off the burner and comes to him.</p>
<p>****: No, you’re mad. She tenderly touches his head.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: If I could get my hands on whoever did
this, you’d see mad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Buddy! You up?! Frank rushes in, lifts a
phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a chair, pulls on the baby’s toe, and
looks at Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bush is pulling out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What happened yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I told you, we went up to Illinois and met a
preacher.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But what happened?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He asked the preacher to come to the funeral.
He said no.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Son of a bitch, that’s got to be..</p>
<p>****: Sorry. Sorry. Where’s the preacher?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It won’t do you any good.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He knows something about Bush, something bad,
I think.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Wouldn’t say but..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well if Bush wants him, by God, Bush is gonna
get him.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You want eggs, Frank, or will the skillet
do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What’s wrong? My husband has his head
bashed in and all you care about is this party!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s not like that, Katie, this is for all of
us. You’re like.. family to me.. I..</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: This is not how family acts!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, I’m sorry. I’ve never had any practice.
You okay? Buddy nods. Frank leaves. Buddy mutters to the baby..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Stay out of her way today, partner.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Fool, it’s too late for bulbs..</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: .too goddamn late..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Reverend Jackson? Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral
home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’d you find me? Frank just smiles, takes
off his hat, and offers his hand. Charlie gives him a long look and
reluctantly motions him in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I was going to play some dominos this
afternoon. But something told me to stay home. I should have played
dominos. Is he out there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bush? No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pretty sure.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you check the back? Frank snorts,
liking Charlie immediately.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You told Bush that you wouldn’t come to the
funeral?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If he got that, why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: To help you rethink it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t need any help.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have you rethought it? So there is a
need.</p>
<p>****: First off, Bush doesn’t know I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wouldn’t be so sure about that. He’s got
a way of making people do what he wants them to. Frank squirms, knows it
true.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is he really a hermit? Frank whistles and
takes Bush’s poster out of his coat. Charlie jerks at the picture of the
wild man.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He came to see me after he’d been here, wants
to call the party off.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Said he’d meant it to be a.. end of the line,
tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn’t have the guts to
open his mouth and he couldn’t get anybody to talk for him. You know
anything about that part? At first he said he wanted everybody to come
who had a story about him. But he didn’t want to hear their bullshit
stories, did he? Pardon my language. He wants to tell one, doesn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: About time.</p>
<p><strong>frankfrank</strong>: Whatever he did, it’s been locked up in
him for 40 years and he can’t get it out. I think he told you. You may
be the only person he told. And now he wants you to tell it for him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Because he won’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Or can’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Or won’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Or can’t.</p>
<p>****: At least he wants the truth to come out, give him that.</p>
<p>****: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is there a boarding house around here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I said I’d think.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah but if you’re not coming, I’m not going
back. I made promises I can’t keep to people I care about. This falls
apart they won’t blame Bush. Bank will take my business.. If I’m gonna
have to start over again, might as well be from here. Charlie scowls at
him.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What are you doing, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Getting a suntan. Bush starts to get up then
falls back against the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Are you stuck?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You have no goddamn idea how right you are,
son. Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I’ll sit here a minute. Bush looks at the
butterfly bandage on Buddy’s head.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: We’re a pair, ain’t we?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Just going through the motions.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: There’s Alive and there’s Dead. And there’s a
worst place in between them that I hope you never know nothing
about.</p>
<p>****: Do you know who hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Sonsabitches.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Listen. Frank went
somewhere and the raffle money is gone.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You figure he took off with it?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t want to think that. But
the money’s not here and I don’t know where it is. He said he’d call and
he never did.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Well.. what do you want to do? Buddy looks
back at Bush.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t.. I want to make this funeral for you
if you want it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Hell. Do it if you can.</p>
<p>****: I guess for everyone like me, there’s one like you, son. I
about forgot that. Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush
forces himself up on his own and walks out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m glad you decided to come, sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Free will is not all that it’s cracked up
to be.</p>
<p>****: Did you take the money out of the casket?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You forgot?! Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: In the hearse, under the floorboards. Charlie
remembers that Frank said he wasn’t coming back and gives him a look.
Buddy is giving Frank the same look.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now all we got
to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and..</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush already said
he would do it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re shittin’ me?! Charlie gets up and
starts walking away..</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where can I catch a train?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can’t leave you just got here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Watch and learn.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hold on..</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where’s the station?</p>
<p><strong>133 ext - bush’s land/road - morning 133</strong>: A tractor
pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator on it, a truck loaded
with equipment and workers for the big event rumbles down a dirt road.
The Quinn Funeral home hearse completes the unlikely parade.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Expecting a crowd? Frank and Buddy give
each other a look.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Honestly? We don’t have a clue about what’s
going to happen here.</p>
<p><strong>set-up sequence:</strong>: The big old honking generator is
unloaded. Holes are dug. 10 foot poles are slid from the truck and huge
speaker horns are attached. Speaker poles are pulled up and set into
holes. Frank directs a gang of 6 KIDS who are selling raffle tickets
making sure they know that he has his eyes on them. A BAND arrives on
the back of pick-up truck. The Generator kicks on belching smoke
everywhere. Frank is yelling Whoa Whoa! Disaster in the making.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Pretty nice jail. Charlie enters and looks
around the little room.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Why did you change your mind? Charlie just
looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any reason he could
give.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How do you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I don’t. He gets a haunted look that catches
Charlie off guard.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I’m gonna try and tell it, Charlie, I really
am. But if I can’t get it done, would you do it? I want it said. Please,
sir. Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Tell’em the box is in the barn.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch,
now what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, hey, where you going? He said the
woods..</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Closer.</p>
<p><strong>theman</strong>: He’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I’m
Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home. Welcome to the live funeral party of
Mr. Felix Bush! People don’t know whether to clap or not. Some do and
the rest of them pick it up. Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the
baby.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Where’s Mattie?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: She wouldn’t come. I don’t..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve done some things in my life, but never
this. Bet you haven’t either, bet no one has.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We try to make things predictable and safe
but if we don’t risk everything to get what we want, we don’t want it
enough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The person who made all of this happen for us
doesn’t like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn
Funeral Home and I’m proud to know him. Buddy is embarrassed and moved.
Kathryn’s eyes soften.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Sonsabitches. Carl drops his can. The other
men drop their cans but Gary starts to pull a pistol from his back
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Go on, I’ll paint the porch with his head.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t do it! Gary drops the pistol.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Now pick up them cans and keep pouring.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You heard me. The men cautiously pick up the
cans..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Pour it on your head. All of it. The men look
at each other. Bush cocks the other barrel of his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>theman</strong>: I won’t!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Pour it or die, I don’t care which. The men
hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over them. Burning and
spitting they empty the cans. Suddenly Theman bolts, moaning and running
blind with gas in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I got two barrels, anybody else wants to
rabbit, now’s the time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know many of you have heard stories about
Mr. Bush. But today I’ve been told that we’re going to hear another kind
of story, his. A murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they
see.. .Bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at Carl and Gary’s
backs. They are drenched with gas and it is burning them through their
clothes. Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush. Quinn and Charlie follow
the crowd’s eyes to Bush.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Holy Mother of.. SHERIFF DEPUTIES beside the
stage see Bush. But everyone remains frozen, not knowing what has
happened or what to do now. Is this the crazy Bush of the legends?</p>
<p><strong>89a.</strong>: Buddy starts toward Bush. Kathryn tries to
stop him but he pulls free and walks slowly toward Bush. A shot rings
out!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t hurt him! It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>please, please..</strong>: Bush cracks his shotgun, walks
slowly to the boy, gently takes the 45, empties the shells, and hands
the gun back.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: A second chance is a precious thing, son.
Don’t waste it. The boy plops down, overwhelmed. And suddenly everyone
is in motion. The Deputies run toward Bush. Frank and Charlie rush from
the stage. Kathryn and Horton are going. Buddy arrives at Bush first and
sees the blood weeping onto his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Are you alright, sir?! Without turning Bush
glances at the Deputies.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Tried to burn me out. Let the boy be, he
didn’t mean nothing. As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank,
Charlie, Kathryn and Horton arrive. Carl looks at Horton with pleading
eyes and nods to Tom.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Help him, Gus, please..</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Folks, I’ve just received word of a
tragic turn of events at the Bush Funeral Party. It seems that Mr. Bush
has been shot. I repeat, Mr. Felix Bush has been shot. There is no word
of condition..</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: When I know more I will let you know. I’m
sure he would appreciate your prayers..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Close the door. Charlie slams the door. Frank
examines the wound. Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars
on Bush’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Missed the bone. Got any alcohol and clean
rags? Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment of
herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Why don’t you sit down, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Boil some water and I’ll tell you how to make
me a poultice. Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is gonna hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Don’t sugar coat it.</p>
<p><strong>reverend horton</strong>: Lord, you say you move in
mysterious ways and we believe you because we don’t understand much of
anything. And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what’s
happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to
each other and find some forgiveness and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>bus h</strong>: Pretty good prayer. Mighta been wrong about
that preacher.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why don’t you lay down, Felix?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Let’s go ’fore I lose my nerve.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Are you sure? Bush scowls at the huge blood
stain on his shirt. He looks at Frank’s white shirt. Frank just stares
at him. Bush keeps looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his
tie.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You ain’t nervous? All them white folks out
there?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There’s white folks here?!</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Stick with me, you’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re the one they’re shooting at. As
Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings flooding in with
the light. He looks at Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy? Bush
straightens himself up and goes out the door.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix wants
to continue with his funeral. And he’s asked me to say a few words. Just
below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn. Charlie glances
back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the words. Finally he holds
his hands out, wide apart.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We like to imagine that good and bad, right
and wrong, are miles apart. But the truth is, very often they’re.. and
laces his fingers</p>
<p>****: .all tangled up with each other. Bush raises his head and looks
at Charlie’s back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Some 40 years ago Felix Bush dropped into
my life and then dropped out. In between he built the most beautiful
sanctuary that I’ve ever seen. A lot of wonderful things happened in
that church. Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and
puts his hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Charlie gives
him a long look then steps away from the microphone and moves back to
where Bush was standing. Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath,
and walks up to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody
that had anything good to say about me. Hell of a thing. His voice booms
out over the crowd, startling him. He looks down, sees Buddy, Kathryn,
Frank and Horton. He looks closer for someone most important but she is
not there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I’m not a smart man or a wise one. I don’t
know what kind of man I am. I was always restless, thought I’d see the
world. But I didn’t hardly go nowhere.. on purpose..</p>
<p>****: Because.. because I did something that I was ashamed of.
Something I couldn’t ever fix.</p>
<p>****: Ya’ll probably think you know what you’d do or what you
wouldn’t. And I wish you good luck with that. I really do.</p>
<p>****: When I told Charlie what I’d done, he told me to confess to God
and the law and to.. to someone else.. so I could get forgiveness. But I
didn’t want forgiveness.</p>
<p>****: I needed to hold on to what I did.. to be sick from it every
day of my life. So I never told nobody else. He stops, not knowing how
to go on. The crowd has quieted completely. As as his eyes sweep over
the sea of expectant faces, he suddenly SEES HER coming through the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I fell in love with a married lady. And
somehow she fell in love with me. It was the only time that I have been
in love.</p>
<p>****: We made a plan to run off and start a new life but she didn’t
show up at the time that we said we’d meet. I got a funny feeling and I
went to her house. Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush
talking just to her.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Her husband answered the door.</p>
<p>****: He had blood on him. For Mattie all of this is like window into
the past being suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and
mesmerized.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I hit him pretty hard, knocked him down. Can’t
remember going upstairs but I remember I saw a hammer on the steps and
it had blood and hair on it. The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I found her in the bedroom. She was crawling
across the floor.</p>
<p>****: But before I could get to her and help her up.. a kerosene lamp
hit the wall. And then her husband jumped on my back. Funny what happens
sometimes when things go wrong. It’s like the clock stops and you have
all the time in the world to think. I could see that her husband had set
the downstairs on fire before he came up.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: And as I was slamming his head into the wall,
trying to get shed of him, I could see clear as anything that it was all
my fault. If I’d just never spoke to her..</p>
<p>****: And as I was thinking about that, I saw that the lamp he threw
had set the room we were in on fire too. Bush forces himself to keep
looking into Mattie.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: And then I realized that I was on fire. I
tried to put myself out but I couldn’t, everything was..</p>
<p>****: I dropped him, turned around and saw her lying on the floor and
called her name. She looked up at me..</p>
<p>****: .and the next thing I knew, I was flying.. A loud roar of fire
and crushing timbers..</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: I don’t know how I got out the window.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: No matter how many times I play it in my mind,
I can’t remember jumping. I thought I killed him, but maybe he pushed
me, I don’t know… I swear to you, if I left her in there.. everything I
know about myself is a lie. But that don’t matter.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t get her out, Little Bit, I didn’t. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Oh, Felix.. He sniffs her hair and tenderly
touches it.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Wonder if her hair would be white?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How you doing, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Just fair, son.</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire.
Paid them to break into the funeral home too.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can’t stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can
he?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Spend his money on lawyers now. You know how
thrifty they are. Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is
still holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: He ain’t gonna throw rocks at me, is he?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Not if knows what’s good for him.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: You boys did good. Real good. Let’s settle
up.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We don’t have to do that now. You get some
rest.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. We’ll come out tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Bring my shirt back, I just got it broke
in.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you alright, Mattie? She looks up at
Frank for a long moment, her face softening.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I’m still moving, I
guess.. He doesn’t know what that means but she has finally really
looked at him and that’s something he’ll hold onto. Kathryn comes and
hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back. Bush goes to Charlie. Frank
is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush said. Buddy
gives him nothing,</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Thanks again for coming, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m proud of you.</p>
<p>****: Thank you for my church.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Did you ever get my bill?</p>
<p><strong>horton</strong>: Can we get a ride our car’s about 2 miles
down the road. Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so
they all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides. It
makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting embrace then
climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long moment all then closes
the door. As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
the back window. Buddy waves back.</p>
<p>****: Look at that. My funeral and everybody’s in there but me. The
hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, Felix, this one’s for real, I guess.
I didn’t actually see them put you in the box so.. Charlie glances over
and notices “Charlie” on one of the dog’s grave markers. He snorts and
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wherever you are, you’re probably giving
someone a hard time or something wonderful and priceless just to confuse
them. Not everything can be figured out, nor everybody. I wish you peace
from the burdens of your mind and heart. I wish it for us all. Mattie
moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand out to catch her
should she should stumble. She stares down at the FB on the coffin,
opens her hand, and lets the picture of her sister drift down onto the
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: A 50 on the outside, all ones inside. Less
than $100.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I told you. Nobody listens to the preacher.
Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: The day of the party he told me about the
will he had in the secret drawer of his table. He left the raffle money
to all of us. Everyone is shocked, touched.</p>
<p>****: But you have to pay for Mule’s upkeep for the rest of his life.
Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And he set up a fund for the upkeep of your
church.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No catch, sir.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Still don’t get it, do you? With Felix,
there’s always a catch.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Maybe he just knew you’d go crazy wondering
what it was. They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has had upon
them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but growing family and stops
and looks back at the grave and the pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity
about the fearsome old man has not abated. Nor will it ever.</p>
