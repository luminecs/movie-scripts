<p><strong>ducks</strong>: It’s Peezee. Gotta be. He hates your fuckin’
guts.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ducks</strong>: Who else knew about the money? And how did
Peezee know they popped Tony Cisco when we didn’t even hear about it
’til last night?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ducks</strong>: What is so hard to understand here? You said
yourself Peezee was a mamaluke and you couldn’t trust him. Now suddenly
you’re soft on the guy?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I just don’t think it was him.</p>
<p><strong>ducks</strong>: Okay, I’ll bite. If not Peezee, then who?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I think it was you, Ducks.</p>
<p><strong>ducks</strong>: You gotta be kiddin’!</p>
<p><strong>ducks</strong>: Caesar, you know me! What kind of fuckin’
idiot would I have to be to try that shit with you?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: A dead fuckin’ idiot.</p>
<p><strong>tv screen</strong>: The title credits come up on the
made-for-cable series we’ve been watching, “Little Caesar.” CLAPPING AND
CHEERING from</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Garbage. Change the channel.</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy</strong>: Okay, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Hey! What’re you doin’, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn’t mean any
disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy</strong>: Punks.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>int. cell block - moments later</strong>: As Vitti approaches
his cell, he sees a prison guard standing by. His cellmate, EARL, a
giant of a man, comes out of their cell carrying his bedroll and a box
containing his other meager possessions.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s goin’ on, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They’re transferring me.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t know. Thanks for looking out for me,
Mr. Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, Earl. Is that my after-shave?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m sorry. I just grabbed stuff – I didn’t
know –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: That’s okay. Keep it. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Thanks. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>int. vitti’s cell - middle of night</strong>: The cellblock
is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened cell, looks around to make
sure no one is watching, then</p>
<p><strong>int. memorial chapel - day</strong>: A deluxe casket flanked
by elaborate floral displays and an easel displaying a portrait of the
deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel. Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back,
an overflow crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a teenager, BEN’S
MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS. At the podium, the RABBI is
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>rabbi</strong>: And now I’d like to call on Isaac’s son,
Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to say a few words.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s very difficult for me to talk about my
father, because in a sense I’m talking about two men.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: One, of course, is the public Isaac Sobel, the
eminent psychotherapist and popular author known to millions of readers
around the world.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The second Isaac Sobel is the private man – my
father – Dad. And for those of you who knew him well and knew our family
– well, let’s face it – my father was a psychotic, mind- fucking prick.
An arrogant, abusive, ego-inflated –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Guess who, you fuck!</p>
<p><strong>int. chapel</strong>: Ben turns away from Laura.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul? I have to, uh, take this. This isn’t a
good time.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Not a good time? Let me explain something to
you. I’m in fucking Hell right now. This is not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t talk right now. My father died!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So what does that have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Call me later –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Don’t hang up on, Sobel! They’re tryin’ to
kill me!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: He stands there for a long beat just staring,
the DIAL TONE BUZZING in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy #2</strong>: Ooh, they got tapioca. I love tapioca.
You all right, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy #2</strong>: Can I have your tapioca?</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: Just keep walkin’, Don Corleone.</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: I said, shut up, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: You’re a dead man, jefe!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: appropriate dance</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘When you’re a Jet, If the shit hits the fan,
You got brothers around, You’re a family man…’</p>
<p><strong>coyote</strong>: You’re a dead man, jefe!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘I like to be in America, Okay by me in
America…’</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ’Tonight, tonight, won’t be just</p>
<p><strong>ext. sobel house - later</strong>: A limo pulls up to an old,
but well-maintained suburban house, the family gets out and starts
walking to the house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t believe he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I can’t believe what you said about him. Cold
and withholding? You had to tell everybody?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nice. Why didn’t you just take a swing at
the casket?</p>
<p><strong>int. foyer - continuous action</strong>: The family enters
the foyer.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, I might have strayed from my notes a
little. I’m dealing with a lot of stuff here. Grief is a process.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Dr. Sobel, I’m Agent Miller, this is Special
Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau of Investigation. We’d just like to ask
you a few questions, if we could.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Can I ask what this is about? We just came
from the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: We know this is a difficult time for you,
Dr. Sobel. Sorry about your father.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, I’m going to miss him</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean – there were issues – as, I think, there
are with any father and son. He wasn’t especially warm –</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ben – once today? Enough.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I’m just saying, in spite of all that –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – he was a great, great legs. Man.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: Dr. Sobel, you received a call this morning
from Paul Vitti?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What makes you think Paul Vitti called me?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Because we monitor and record all his phone
calls from Sing Sing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then yes. He did.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That was him on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And you didn’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wow. Talk about withholding.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You told her – You told her at the drop of a
hat.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She’s with the F.B.I. She needs to know these
things.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, I see. And I don’t. Why tell Laura? She
couldn’t possibly handle a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You folks need a minute?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, we’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: If you don’t need me anymore, I’ll be in the
kitchen. And two words of advice – from one professional woman to
another – Pant. Suit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She’s grieving. It’s a process.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: We understand. Vitti?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were involved in some
organized crime activity a couple of years ago. I mean, I wasn’t
involved – not ‘involved’ involved – I was just trying to help him
therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Well, shortly after you spoke, he</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of breakdown?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I think you’d better go up there and see for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel pretty
and witty and bright…’</p>
<p><strong>int. observation room - same time</strong>: Ben watches
through a two-way mirror with the prison psychiatrist, DR. CUTLER. They
can hear Vitti through a wall-mounted speaker.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: I’m treating him with Thioridazine, 300
milligrams, T.I.D. That seems to keep him pretty calm.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That would keep a parade pretty calm. He just
keeps singing West Side Story songs?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: ‘Tonight,’ ‘Maria,’ the balcony
scene.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The balcony scene? Both parts?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: Oh, yeah. Get him to do ‘Officer
Krupke.’ It’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>int. padded cell</strong>: Ben and Dr. Cutler enter. Vitti
doesn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ’Who’s the pretty girl in the mirror</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul, it’s me. Ben Sobel. Paul? Maria?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Tony?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, boy. What’s going on, Maria?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The rumble – it’s tonight! I have to get out
of here. I don’t want to die. No, Chino, no!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul? Paul?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: This is how it’s been. He sings for a
while, then he goes completely catatonic.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really. Can we take him to an examining
room?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>int. examining room - minutes later</strong>: Vitti sits
inert on the examination table.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You already did a neurological work- up?</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of
stroke –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Completely catatonic –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Totally gone. Well, I don’t think he’s smart
enough to be faking. Street smart, yes, but we’re talking about an I.Q.
just north of a bedroom slipper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So if I just stuck him with this needle, he
probably wouldn’t even respond.</p>
<p><strong>dr. cutler</strong>: I don’t know. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy! Got a
rocket in your pocket, keep cool-y cool boy –’</p>
<p><strong>int. sing sing - consultation room - next day</strong>: Vitti
is sitting at a table facing Ben. Dr. Cutler observes from a chair in
the corner.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul, we’re going to give you some tests to
assess your mental condition. There’s no pressure – just answer as best
you can. Do I have your consent to share the results of these tests?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Mommy’s mad at me because I made a boom on
the rug.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll take that as a yes. Okay, I’m going to
show you ten cards, each containing a picture of an inkblot. I want you
to look at each card and tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I see you. I see him. I see a table.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Focus, Paul. You haven’t seen the card yet.
What does this look like to you? Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: It looks like snow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, Paul, the other side.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: A bat. A big bat. Or a weasel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Bat or weasel. All right.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: And he’s got a little girl – no, it’s a
little boy – in his teeth – and he’s shakin’ him and shakin’ him ‘cause
the kid didn’t wipe himself good – and the kid is screaming because the
bat-weasel ripped out his throat and the blood is shootin’ out of his
neck vein. That’s the blood.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See anything else?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Just the pussy with the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Pussy with teeth. Next card.</p>
<p><strong>shapes test</strong>: Vitti is literally trying to pound a
square peg into a round hole.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now try repeating the numbers backwards. For
instance, if I was 1- 2-3, you will say 3-2-1. Okay, 7-3-8.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: 3-2-1.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Try again. 7-3-8.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Blue.</p>
<p><strong>thematic apperception test</strong>: Vitti studies a vague
and ambiguous photograph of a man standing beside a bed with a sleeping
woman and child on it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just tell me what you think is going on in this
picture.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This is a picture of a guy – nice,
hardworking guy – comes home and finds out his wife’s been screwin’ this
midget while he was out of town.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Screwing a midget. And how does the story
end?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I think he works over the midget for a while,
then he blows ’em away.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The wife or the midget?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Trick question, right? Both of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one, I’m going
to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to. Ready? ‘I
get angry –’</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, you’re supposed to complete the
sentence.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I did. I said ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wasn’t asking if you agreed or disagreed; it
was more like, ‘I get angry when –’</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: – whenever.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, that about does it for me.</p>
<p><strong>int. u.s. attorney’s office - day</strong>: Ben meets with
RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New
York.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Based on his symptoms and the test results, I’d
say brief psychotic disorder – if it persists, possibly schizophreniform
disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: So he’s crazy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dr. Cutler? No, he’s annoying, but –</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain
people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation –
soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation,
or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to
kill you – it can produce a temporary psychotic state.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: How temporary?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A day, a week, up to a month – if the
precipitating stressors are removed.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Which means he’s not going to get any better
while he’s still in the can.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He could get worse. He could deteriorate to the
point where he’d be permanently schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Then I’d say he’s got a real problem,
because he goes before the parole board in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think they’ll let him out?</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Oh, yeah, I’m sure they’ll want to release a
major Mafia figure who’s now totally deranged on top of it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, couldn’t you release him to a halfway
house or some place where he could get some decent treatment? Based on
my earlier work with him, I don’t think he’s dangerous, and I think he
was making a real effort to reform himself.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You do, huh? Okay. Then I’ll tell you what.
I’m gonna release him into your custody.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My
father just died – and I’ve got this bulging disc in my neck – and we’re
redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You want to see him killed in prison?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Or sent to a facility for the criminally
insane.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Then he’s all yours. I’m going to talk to
the Bureau of Prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal
institution.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What? I can’t be an institution.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You’ve got thirty days to get him in shape
for his parole hearing. That means sane, sober and gainfully employed.
But let me warn you, Doctor. If he fucks up in any way – if he flees, or
if I find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get
back on the street and return to a life of crime – I will hold you
totally responsible, and I’ll see that you are stripped of your license
and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. We’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You still want him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, Paul – this way.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This way, Paul. Over here. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Leg, Paul. Leg up.</p>
<p><strong>int. car - moments later</strong>: Ben STARTS the CAR and
pulls away with Vitti still slumped in his seat. Once out of sight of
the prison, Vitti straightens and turns on Ben, suddenly lucid.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You fucking son-of-a-bitch! Where the fuck do
you get off sticking me with a needle?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I knew it! I knew you were faking! You used me
to get you out of prison!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Took you long enough. I was singin’ West Side
Story for three fuckin’ days. I’m half a fag already.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I call you to say somebody’s trying to kill
me and you hang up on me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was at the funeral home!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You’re my fuckin’ doctor!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My father died!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Me me me me! He’s dead! Get over it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you hearing yourself?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m deeply sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, I can see how touched you are.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s the difference? You hated him
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I loved my father. I’m feeling a lot of grief
right now.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m not sensing it, but if you say so.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Decongestant. I’m getting over a cold. All
right, what’s going on? Who’s after you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t know – take your pick. Could be my
old family, or could be the Rigazzis. Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi - - Lou
‘The Wrench’?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why “The Wrench”?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Because he twisted a guy’s head off once.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Off?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Off. Fuckin’ Calabrese – animals. And comin’
from me you know that’s a big compliment.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sure they’d be flattered. So –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The feds are really putting the pressure on.
The families are fighting each other again – what’s left of ‘em. It’s
the fall of the fuckin’ Roman Empire. It’s World War Three out
there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So what does that have to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: They knew I was gettin’ out soon and the last
thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe if you just explain to them – that you’re
out of it now, that you’re starting a new life –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, they’ll probably want to throw me a
party and give me a gold watch. Trust me – nobody’s lookin’ forward to
me being out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You are, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Me? Oh, yeah, my future looks real fuckin’
rosy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Want to grab your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m not gonna be here that long. Jelly’s
pickin’ me up in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul! I don’t think you understand. You’re in
my custody. I could get in a lot of trouble if you screw up.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I’ll call you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing Sing?
Thursday’s meatloaf night. I can have you back there in no time. The
U.S. Attorney was very clear. You stay with me; therapy every day; you
can’t leave the area without permission –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What are you, my father now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you have to get a job as soon as you’re
well enough, which is now. So are you coming in with me or do I have to
make a phone call?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m comin’. Some fuckin’ life this is gonna
be.</p>
<p><strong>int. u.s. attorney’s office - later</strong>: Chapin is
conferring with another U.S. ATTORNEY, DAVIS, and Agents Miller and
Cerrone.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: You really think Vitti is crazy?</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Yeah, he’s about as crazy as I am.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: If we can use Vitti to escalate this war, we
might just end up putting them all away.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: That’s if he goes back to his old life.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: If? People like Paul Vitti don’t change.
This guy’s been a menace to society since he was twelve years old. Being
a criminal is all he knows. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: He’s gonna head straight for trouble. Then
all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces. We could get
twenty, maybe even thirty indictments next time the grand jury
convenes.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You know, Giuliani started this way.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: You running for mayor?</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Could happen. Just stick with Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>int. sobel house - later</strong>: Ben and Laura are in the
kitchen, cleaning up the dinner dishes. Ben is wearing an apron that
says “To Heck with Housework!” and a pair of Playtex rubber gloves.
Laura is angrily muscling dishes around.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: How could you? How could you bring him here?
That – – mobster – in my home – eating off my dishes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t have a lot of choice.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, there’s a law that says you have to bring
a gangster home?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I told you. He’s in my custody. I’m a federal
institution.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You should be in an institution. Why couldn’t
he just go home?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: His wife and kids aren’t here. They’re in
Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ohio! Sure. Everyone gets to be in Ohio
except me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: His life was threatened and he didn’t want to
endanger his family.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: How thoughtful! What about endangering our
family? I think my teeth are loose. Feel my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Honey, your teeth are fine. I know it’s an
imposition, but what could I do? I didn’t want him here. They -</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You didn’t want him, I didn’t want him, but
here he is!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Here he is!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Somebody said something about coffee.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That was you. You said you wanted some.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So what’s the holdup?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why don’t you make your friend some coffee.
I’m going upstairs to take a long bath and hopefully drown.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ll have to forgive her. She’s usually a
great hostess.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I understand. She’s uncomfortable. The whole
situation’s a little awkward with me bein’ here – but let’s face it,
Emily fuckin’ Post she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Emily fuckin’ Post. Well, that explains why she
rarely used her middle name.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Listen, I got a friend coming over. I didn’t
want you to be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of friend? Because if it’s ‘The
Wrench,’ or ‘The Power Drill’ or any other kind of tool –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Not that kind of friend. It’s a personal
thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: They won’t stay late, will they?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Are you really that pussy-whipped?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not – this has nothing to do with
Laura.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I heard her busting your balls.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We were having a disagreement. A certain amount
of conflict is normal in a marriage.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Or?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Or you’re pussy-whipped.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Good night, Whippy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Remember, this is only temporary.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Oh, really? I didn’t hear you the tenth
fuckin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>int. upstairs hallway - moments later</strong>: Ben knocks on
Michael’s door and walks in without waiting to be asked.</p>
<p><strong>int. michael’s room - continuous action</strong>: Michael is
sitting up in bed reading.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mike, can we talk for a second?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sure. What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know the last few weeks have been kind of
tough with Grandpa – dying and everything – and it might’ve felt to you
like I didn’t have time for you or I didn’t care about how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good. Because I want you to know that you can
talk to me about stuff and that I can really listen and understand what
you’re going through.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I do, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And if I seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it’s
just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. He wanted
everything done his way and sometimes I just felt like nothing I ever
did was good enough. I don’t want it to be that way with us.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you know, at times like this we all might
start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how
devastated you’d be if I died. Right?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s good. Good talk. And I realize it’s all
a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, really? I didn’t hear you the tenth
fuckin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s not funny. Good night, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Good night, Whippy.</p>
<p><strong>cute girl</strong>: I gotta get home. What was that
about?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I have no idea. Parenting stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sobel house - night</strong>: The suburban street is
dark and quiet and all the lights are off in the house.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ohhhhh! Ohhhhh, Paul!</p>
<p><strong>int. master bedroom - same time</strong>: The room is dark.
We PAN UP the foot of Ben and Laura’s bed and find them both wide awake
staring straight up at the ceiling, listening.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ohhhh, God! Oh, oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This has to be some kind of record, don’t you
think? It’s been like forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: How long are you going to let them go on?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let them? How much longer can he go? Another
twenty minutes, I’m either breaking it up or calling the Guinness Book
of Records.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, give me a break. She’s got to be</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s not entirely true.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay, sometimes you do sound like that.</p>
<p><strong>int. michael’s room - same time</strong>: Michael’s
girlfriend is gone. He has his bedroom door open a crack and he’s
standing there holding a small tape recorder and smiling broadly.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ah, ah, ah, ah…!</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - same time</strong>: Agents Cerrone and Miller
sit in a sedan with a small, sophisticated-looking microphone trained on
the Sobel house just down the street. They hear the high-pitched
MOANING. Miller gives Cerrone a look.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: Oh, come on. Nobody sounds like that.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - moments later</strong>: Ben takes a deep
breath and knocks sharply on the guest room door. The heavy MOANING
STOPS. After a moment, Vitti appears wearing only a bathrobe. Ben can
see the beautiful SHEILA sitting naked on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have a 17-year-old son.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So let him get his own fuckin’ girl.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can I talk to you, please?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Actually, I’m right in the middle of
someone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Miss? Excuse me. There’s no smoking in this
house.</p>
<p><strong>int. michael’s room - same time</strong>: Michael freezes,
about to light a cigarette himself.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - moment later</strong>: Ben comes down the
stairs with Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Minding my own fuckin’ business, like you
should be doin’.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, it’s a little hard with the live sex show
going on in the guest room.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’ve been in prison for two and a half years.
What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Go to a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: That’s what I wanted to do, but you told me I
had no choice – it was either here or Sing Sing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not trying to punish you. These aren’t my
rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might
like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I’ve been jerkin’ off about
for eight hundred consecutive nights – a nice home- cooked meal. Ohhhh,
tuna casserole.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That girl is not staying here.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I think you’re jealous.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, yeah, I’m really jealous.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I didn’t hear nothin’ comin’ out of your
room.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We don’t think it’s necessary to wake the
neighbors every time we have sex.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, if you’re really quiet, you might be
able to do it without even wakin’ up your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Ohhh. Ohhh.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I told her if I wasn’t back in two minutes to
start without me. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is not a good start, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining area - next morning</strong>: Laura and Ben are
hosting a brunch for the out-of-town relatives. Laura offers a basket of
bagels to a seated, older woman.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Aunt Ester, I’m so sorry we had to put you up
at the hotel. We wanted you here with us, but we had an unexpected house
guest.</p>
<p><strong>aunt esther</strong>: Your father always had room for us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry. Next time I lose a parent, I’ll be
sure to reserve the guest room.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Go to hell, Paul! You just go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy fuckin’
whore.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Go back to turning tricks in Jersey for all I
fuckin’ care.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: How’s it goin’? Oh, we got food. Good.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have to fuck
to get some bacon around here?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Not you, I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t we go to my office? I’ll make you a
plate.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s office - moments later</strong>: Ben and Vitti
enter. Vitti still in his robe.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What is it with your relatives? They tend to
overreact quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know. All you did was flash everybody in the
dining room.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So? From the look of ‘em, some of those
broads haven’t seen the old salcicc’ in a long time. It’s good for
them.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, when the paramedics revive my Aunt
Goldie, I’ll be sure to ask her. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ah ah ah!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So what are you going to do, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: With your life.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: First I’m gonna find out who’s tryin’ to kill
me. I’m a target. Somebody could shoot right through that window – blow
my fuckin’ head off.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, that’s a priority. Have you thought about
what you’re going to do for work?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. I’m too big for a jockey so I was
thinkin’ maybe a hairdresser. They’ll call me Mr. Paul.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on. There must be something you like to
do.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I like hitting a guy on the head with a
baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, sporting goods. We’ll check the want ads
tomorrow but don’t get your hopes up. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the usual
–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Who am I? I’m the guy who’s paying you $150
an hour to play these stupid fuckin’ games. You know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know that. I mean what are you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What do you mean, ‘What am I?’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just want to know how you see yourself.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You’re making me very fuckin’ nervous.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just answer the question. What are you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m the boss.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really? The boss of what – Jelly? You’re not
the boss of me. So what are you the boss of?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You, you’re good. I see what you’re doing
here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What am I doing, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You’re pissing me off is what you’re doing.
Look at me. It’s starting again, the anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ve spent your whole life becoming who you
are and now you can’t be that anymore – that’s gotta be scary. If you’re
not Paul Vitti the mob boss, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, let’s think. When you were a kid, What
did you want to be?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t know. Who remembers that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You must’ve wanted to be something when you
were little – fireman?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Baseball player?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Astronaut?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Al Capone?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, maybe. What did you want to be?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re not talking about me.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Fine. I wanted to be a philatelist.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You wanted to look up people’s assholes all
day?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, Paul, I believe you’re thinking of a
proctologist. I wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You must’ve been a lot of laughs when you
were a kid. Lonely, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh yeah. Big time. So what did you want to
be?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You afraid to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then tell me. I’m not here to judge you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay. When I was really little – like seven
or eight – maybe I wanted to be a cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A cowboy. Really?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. My father gave me a cowboy suit – you
know, the vest, the chaps, the cap guns – the whole thing. And he used
to take me up to my uncle’s farm in New Jersey and lead me around on
this pony. Yippee-i-o. You happy now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So you watched cowboy movies and TV shows with
your father.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Everybody. The whole family. My father loved
‘Gunsmoke.’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sheriff Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Marshal Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Marshal. So who were your favorite cowboys?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This is so fuckin’ retarded.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone
Ranger –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Interesting. They’re all good guys.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, that’s important. You didn’t want to be the
bad guy. You wanted to be the hero.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t know. Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So why didn’t you become a cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I lived in East Harlem! I joined a street
gang when I was 12 and that was it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Something else happened when you were
twelve.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Something that made you very sad?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A.
Everybody took it pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Something else.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: We playin’ a guessing game here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul! Your father was murdered! Right in front
of you. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Do I remember? I think about it every fuckin’
day of my life. What’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s got everything to do with it. He gave you
the cowboy suit. With a white hat. He was in the mob, but he wanted you
to be a good guy, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. He did.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He didn’t want you in the gang life. He only
did it himself so you wouldn’t have to. He was trying to buy you a
better life than his.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: He always said he wanted me to go to college.
I didn’t even finish high school.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, Paul, this could be a great opportunity
for you. You’re right back where you were when you were twelve. You’ve
got some big choices to make.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay. Okay. That’s enough of that shit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not shit, Paul. My point is, when you’re a
child, you think anything is possible. Wouldn’t it be great to think
like that now?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin’ fairy dust
on me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m just saying you’ve got to keep an open mind
and explore some new possibilities. Try some different things – maybe
you’ll connect with one of them. There’s a career counselor I work with.
I can call him for you. He may be able to help you find a job.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You mean working for somebody? I’m supposed
to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you know unless you try?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Hiya, Doc. Sorry about the window.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining area - moments later</strong>: Jelly is loading
up a plate of food from the buffet, talking to the elderly relatives.
Laura stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I love lox and bagels. I dated a Jewish woman
once. Actually, she might have been the love of my life, but my mother
broke it up.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: She was always hockin’ me a chinick about the
madels. A wonderful woman, my mother, but she fuckin’ hates the
Hebes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Really. More smoked salmon? Don’t be shy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jelly – what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Makin’ new friends. How’s it going, Doc? I
brought some clothes for Mr. Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s great, Jelly. I’d love to catch up with
you – outside.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You got it. Thanks, Mrs. S. So long,
everybody. Ess gesunterhait.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sobel house - moments later</strong>: Ben and Jelly walk
out to the driveway where Jelly’s Buick is parked.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: So. Long time no see. You look good, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you, Jelly – you look – Did you get a
haircut? I thought you were in prison.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: It would appear not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How’d you get out?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: New trial. The evidence in my first trail
was, you know, tainted. Turns out two of the witnesses against me
changed their minds – and the third one, he died after a short
illness.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What did he have?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s not an illness.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Yeah, but it is short.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I got stuff to do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Calm down. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You can’t leave without my permission.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Oh, yeah? Watch me. Drive, Jelly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s it, Paul. I forbid you to go.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Stop sweating, Doc. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If you screw this up, Paul – Paul!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit! Shit, shit, shit!</p>
<p><strong>aunt goldie</strong>: So, the fat one – he’s single?</p>
<p><strong>int. knights of palermo social club - day</strong>: Soldiers
lounge at the bar, keeping a respectful distance from the capos seated
at a table in the rear. All eyes turn as the door opens and Vitti
enters. SAL MASIELLO, Vitti’s old consigliere rises and warmly but
warily welcomes Vitti back into the fold.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Paulie, great to see you! You’re lookin’
good, kid. Lookin’ very good. Jelly, how are ya?</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: So, Paul, we heard you had some trouble
while you were away. Some ‘mental’ problems.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, I’m okay. It was an act. I had to pretend
I was nuts. There were people watching me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Little people?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Doctors. They never woulda let me out if they
thought I was normal.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: So you ain’t crazy?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You want to see crazy? Just tell me who’s
trying to kill me. I’ll show you crazy.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: We’re in a war, Paul – nobody’s safe right
now. The Rigazzis are walkin’ all over us. We got next to nothing coming
in, and I don’t have to tell you, you don’t buy a lot of muscle without
money these days. We need you, Paul. The family needs you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I can’t do it, Sal. I’m out of it.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Come on, Paulie. Nobody used to do the big
jobs like you. Air France– they’re still talkin’ about it.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Sal, even if I wanted to – the feds</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: After your father died, I always treated
you like my own son. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: He was a good man. I still miss him.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I do too.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: So you’ll think about it. For me,
Paulie?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, okay, I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Hey, what is this – a fuckin’ funeral
here? You just got back from college for Chrissakes. We should be havin’
a party for you. Hey, Nino, give everybody a round here. We gotta drink
to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I can’t, Sal. I gotta go talk to the
boss.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: I understand. No problem. It’s good to
have you back, Paul. Don’t forget what I said. We’re countin’ on
you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lopresti house - same morning</strong>: Jelly pulls up,
Vitti gets out and strides up to the front door of a nice home on Staten
Island and RINGS the BELL.</p>
<p><strong>int. entry hall - continuous action</strong>: The door is
opened by EDDIE DEVOL, early thirties, dark and sullen.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘Yeah, what?’ That’s how you answer the
door?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: In the kitchen, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>int. patty’s kitchen - continuous action</strong>: Vitti
enters. PATTY LOPRESTI, mid-forties, still sexy even in an apron, is
mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric mixer.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Paul – what a nice surprise.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: How’s it goin’, Patty?</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Good. It’s good. Give me a kiss, you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Sorry to hear about Carmine. He was a good
man.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Yeah. You live with a person twenty- one
years, then one day they’re</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’ll bet – especially with all the talk about
you being the one who put him there.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: That’s why I try not to gossip, Paul. It’s
ugly. Just a sec. Michelle! Teresa! It’s ten-thirty! Stop fucking around
and get ready for ballet! It’s hard being a single parent and a career
woman.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure you’re very busy.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: The pressure – it’s awful. For instance, a
lot of people think, now that you’re out, you’re going to try and take
the family back from me. But I said, no, Paul would never do that. By
the way, how are Marie and the kids? Still in Ohio? In Shaker Heights?
At 1356 Locust?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You even go near them, you crazy bitch –</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Don’t make me call my guys in. You may need
the shit kicked out of you, but not in here. I just mopped.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: flushed and a little</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I been workin’ out who’s trying</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Nobody’s
gonna be safe unless we can end this thing with the Rigazzis.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So then you didn’t have nothin’ to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Oh, Paul. You actually think I would kill
you? All the years we’ve known each other – the Christmas parties, the
fun times at the beach. It wouldn’t be right. I want us to be friends.
Who knows? Maybe we’ll be more than friends. Want to lick my
beaters?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Thanks. I gotta see a guy about a business
thing.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: What kind of business? You know, if you get
something going, we would expect some kind of consideration – a little
taste.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, this is a legitimate business.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Oh, Paul. I just got a chill.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I just want to be left alone. Put my life
back together – straight up this time. Put the word out, will ya?
Nobody’s got nothin’ to worry about from me.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Sure, Paul. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Don’t be a stranger!</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Watch him like a hawk. If he steps out of
line, it would break my heart, but shoot him in the fuckin’ head.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park avenue audi dealership - later</strong>: Vitti is
trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged
couple. Vitti opens the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Look at the size of that trunk. You could fit
three people in there. Not people – suitcases. It’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So what are you driving now? We have a
Lexus.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: It’s a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs make
good cars, but I ain’t that quick to forget Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p><strong>int. moretti’s steak house - night</strong>: A crowd of
well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the captain’s station. Vitti,
the new host, greets a prominent sports figure who embraces him like an
old friend.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Mario, put Mr. Torre at table five.</p>
<p><strong>joey boots</strong>: Paul, I heard you were out.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>joey boots</strong>: All dressed up for dinner, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Paul, that table for six is ready. You
can send them back.</p>
<p><strong>joey boots</strong>: You’re working here?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Nah – not really. It’s like – I’m on parole,
so I just – I come in, I greet people.</p>
<p><strong>joey boots</strong>: Okay. I get it. Nice seein’ you, Paul.
Don’t want to hold you up. You got people to seat.</p>
<p><strong>flash photo</strong>: Vitti poses for a picture with some
notables.</p>
<p><strong>another photo</strong>: Vitti with some Broadway actors.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Thanks, Paul. Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Hey, could you get us a big bottle of
Pellegrino and another round of drinks?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: And more bread when you get a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You want more bread?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’ll get your drinks now.</p>
<p><strong>int. imperial diamonds - day</strong>: Two Hassidim are in
the back of a 47th Street jewelry store, sorting through a huge pile of
diamonds. Behind the display counter, Vitti stares at the diamonds,
breathing hard, starting to perspire. His customers, a thirty-ish YOUNG
MAN and his FIANCEE, study the diamond engagement ring on her
finger.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: This stone is supposed to be a ‘G’ color,
but it looks kind of yellow, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Fluorescent light. Makes everything look
yellow.</p>
<p><strong>fiancee</strong>: I thought fluorescent light makes
everything look blue?</p>
<p><strong>fantasy - security guard</strong>: bound and gagged.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What am I – Edison? I’m telling you, it’s a
‘G.’</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Can I look at it with a lens?</p>
<p><strong>fantasy - spray-painting</strong>: the camera lens and
clipping the alarm wires.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fiancee</strong>: A lens. Do you have a lens?</p>
<p><strong>fantasy - safe</strong>: in the back as it BLOWS UP.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Ben’s cousin, approaches Vitti who is now
hyperventilating.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m gonna do us both a big favor. I quit.</p>
<p><strong>int. car dealership - day</strong>: The MacInernys are
trembling.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You want to see the manager? Here’s the
manager. Now take a hike, you fuckin’ deadbeats.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Get a Hyundai!</p>
<p><strong>dream sequence - int. ben’s office - night</strong>: Vitti is
on the sofa. He’s wearing a shiny, silk, short- sleeved shirt with the
sleeves turned up, tight, black chino pants and short, black,
pointy-toed boots. His hair is oiled and coifed like early Frankie
Avalon.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I can’t deal with this shit. My grades suck,
I’m gettin’ in fights every day, and if I get suspended again my
mother’s gonna fuckin’ kill me – if the nuns don’t kill me first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund
Freud.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Eins, zwei, drei!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vitti’s mother</strong>: Sit up straight! Pay attention when
the doctor talks to you. This is costing money.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Ma? What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Acht gemacht gehunden nicht.</p>
<p><strong>vitti’s mother</strong>: I tell him the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>door</strong>: BLASTS open, flying off the hinges. Jelly
enters, pushed into the room by a gang of thugs, led by Patty LoPresti,
Eddie DeVol and his guys, all at least ten-feet-tall and all holding
huge guns.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun,
but instead pulls out a long sword. Confused but desperate, he holds up
the sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes limp. He
tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps dropping like a
piece of soft rope. Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at
Vitti, while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring
from his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>int. guest room - next day</strong>: Vitti is back in bed in
his robe, still asleep. The door opens and Laura enters with an interior
decorator who has fabric samples over her arm.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Now in here, I thought we’d get rid of the
wallpaper and maybe put in some wainscoting –</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t look, don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Do you realize it’s almost noon?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Really? Do me a favor, honey – make me a
sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You want a sandwich? Make it yourself. I’m
not afraid of you, Mr. Oh-I’m-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I want you out of
my house.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’ve had it with the bathrobe and the
skulking around and the girlfriend who, I’m sorry, is so obviously
faking it’s not even funny. Enough!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Coulda had that sandwich made by now.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. You don’t like me and I don’t like you.
We can at least agree on that, right?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m going to be honest with you – I’m a very
anxious person –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey! Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We have so much in common. Anyway, this is
not helping me, it’s not helping my marriage, and I know Ben really
needs some alone time. So I’m asking you – as a human being – could you
please leave? Yes, I’ll make you a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, no
onion.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sobel front porch - later</strong>: Jelly comes out the
front door with Vitti’s suitcases as Ben pulls into the driveway. He
gets out of the car holding a small bag from the drugstore and sees
Vitti coming out the front door. Ben stops him on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Where am I going? The orphanage found my real
parents. They want me back. Put those in the car. I’m goin’ to
Jelly’s.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The hell you are. You’re supposed to be in my
custody. We have therapy today.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: For what? The more we talk the worse I get. I
had that dream again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The one where you’re Mussolini?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, the other one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The limp sword dream?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I probably shouldn’t be listening to
this.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So don’t!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you think this dream might be sexual?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I know what you’re thinkin’. The sword is my
cock and I can’t get it up, but that ain’t it. I saw Sheila last night
and I had a hard-on you could swing from.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t want to know that.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You coulda hung wet towels on it.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: He’s like a racehorse in that area.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay! I get it.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Wait in the car! So what does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sex can represent a lot of things. In your case
I think it’s about performance anxiety. Trying to find a job that
fits.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Doc – nothing’s gonna fit. That nine-to-five
bullshit – I’ll fuckin’ kill myself if I have to do that for the rest of
my life. You know they take taxes out of your check? What the fuck is
that? I’m doomed. I’m gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street. Look
at me. I’m havin’ a fuckin’ panic attack here. My heart’s beatin’ like a
rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re hyperventilating.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Breathe into this.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This is your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Tellin’ me I have to get a job like I’m some
fuckin’ nobody. It was humiliating! Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, I’m doing the best I can! If you can’t
appreciate that, or if my best isn’t good enough for you, then maybe you
should find somebody else to talk to, you selfish prick!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m fine. I’m grieving. It’s a process.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Now what are you takin’?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know the TV
show ‘Little Caesar’?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The producer of that show is a man</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Meet him and find out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nogo restaurant - night</strong>: Ben and Laura walk up
to a trendy Japanese restaurant in Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: We finally got him out of the house – why are
we having dinner with him? I mean, how professional is that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is not social. Paul’s meeting a television
producer who might have a job for him. He’s nervous and wants me here as
a buffer. I’m a buffer, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s a grown man. I don’t see why he needs a
chaperone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He doesn’t. He needs a buffer. I’m here in
buffer capacity only.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Ben, if you say ‘buffer’ one more time –</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Didn’t you just take two of those?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, that was something else.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well, you better not drink anything. You know
what happens.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Laura? I’m a doctor? I think I know what I’m
doing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Buffer.</p>
<p><strong>int. fbi car - same time</strong>: Cerrone and Miller watch
the front of the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: They’re all inside. We’re going to get
something to eat. We’ll be back before they finish dinner.</p>
<p><strong>int. nogo restaurant - later</strong>: Seated at a table are
Ben and Laura, Vitti and Sheila, Jelly, and the producer RAOUL BERMAN
and his uptight, downtown GIRLFRIEND. Jelly inspects a piece of raw
octopus, while Raoul gushes over a platter of sushi and sashimi.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I adore this place. Best sushi in town. Have
you tried the yellowtail, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No. We gettin’ any real food? This is like
eatin’ fuckin’ bait.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Bait! That’s funny. Honey, did you hear what
Paul just said? He said this is like eating bait.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I heard him. And I think it was ‘effing
bait.’</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Why you talkin’ like that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Like a fuckin’ retard.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh – this? I took a couple ibuprofen before we
got here – I shouldn’t have had the saki. I’ll be fine. It only lasts a
couple hours. Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need both lips for that
name. You know what I love about Paul? He was born without a filter. He
says exactly what he’s thinking – just lays it right out there. He
doesn’t edit himself.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You wanna shut the fuck up?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See? He just told me to shut the fuck up. No
filter. I love that. Isn’t he great?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Too much buffering. Way too much.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Yes. Paul, I’m such a huge fan of yours – not
a fan, but you know, an admirer.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Don’t admire me too much.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Is there any chance you might be interested
in working on ‘Little Caesar’ as a consultant? Give us technical advice,
coach the actors, make sure the dialogue rings true –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wow. That would be incredible. Did you hear
that, Paul? Raoul wants to know if you’d be interested in working on his
show as a consultant. You know, give technical advice, coach the actors
–</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: In two seconds I’m gonna put a fork in your
eye.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: So what do you think, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, sure, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: This is so exciting. Mr. Berman, I love your
show. Anthony Bella, the guy who plays Nicky Caesar – I think he grew up
in Bensonhurst next door to my cousin’s friend’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: That’s her claim to fame. I hate to bust your
bubble, but he’s not from Bensonhurst. He’s a professional Italian. He
grew up in Connecticut or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Well, wherever he’s from, I think he’s a
wonderful actor.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Yeah, I bet he gets a lot of pussy.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s the matter with you? We got women at
the table.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You said ‘fuckin’.’</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: That’s different. It’s colorful.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, speaking of colorful – this peacock walks
into a bar –</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, my god. Could I get another one,
please?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And one for me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No. No more for the Buffer.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So. I see in the paper where Oklahoma! might
win the Tony award.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Down!!!</p>
<p><strong>a lone gunman</strong>: runs from the restaurant. After a
long beat, the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter
nervously.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s table</strong>: Nobody’s hurt. Vitti helps Sheila to
her feet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I think somebody’s got it in for Raoul.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Holy fucking shit. That was phenomenal!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Hey, pal – got a light?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Where’s your cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I’m trying to cut down.</p>
<p><strong>int. sobel house - same time</strong>: Ben and Laura are
getting ready for bed.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know why you feel you have to save
this man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s my job. He needs me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: So that automatically means you have to help
him? You’re always doing this – putting other people’s needs ahead of
your own, like you’re this martyr or saint or something. It’s like
living with Mother Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Actually, I hear she was tough to live with.
Lot of parties, loud music – lepers.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You don’t need this in your life – especially
not now. You really need to be grieving for your father.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Really? I haven’t seen it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, you know, it’s a process. I mean, we had
issues – there’s some anger – but I’ll work it out.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s okay, honey. You can let it go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I’m – it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s just a confusing time. I became a
therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very
important to me. But is that the only reason I did it? I don’t know. And
now that he’s gone, why do I keep doing it? Is this what I really
want?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I just want you to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Maybe it’s time I started
focusing on me, and, you know, satisfying some of</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, honey, I just brushed my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, that’s not what I meant. I just need – I
don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop - later that night</strong>: Vitti and Jelly
stand with the Gunman on the roof of the parking garage, four stories
above the ground. The guy’s arms are bound. Jelly ties a rope around his
ankles.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m gonna ask you once nicely. Who you
working for?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Fuck me? Fine. Jelly?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’ll ask you again. Who you working for?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: He’s screamin’ too loud. Hold on a
second.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Who are you working for?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Drop him, Jelly.</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Okay! Okay! Rigazzi! I’m working for
Rigazzi!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Pull him back up.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You said drop him.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I said pull him back up.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: That’s not what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You heard what you wanted to hear.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Okay, you got me there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rigazzi plumbing and heating - next morning</strong>: A
“family” business in Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>int. back room - next morning</strong>: The light from
outside barely penetrates the painted windows of the shabby office. LOU
RIGAZZI, aka “Lou the Wrench,” the aging boss of the Rigazzi family,
sits in the half-light as a couple of his soldiers enter with the
battered and hobbling Gunman between them.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Vitti threw me off a roof.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Vitti? You talked to Vitti? What did you
say to him?</p>
<p><strong>gunman</strong>: Nothing. I didn’t tell him anything.
Mr. Rigazzi, can I go – I think my leg’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: That must hurt.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: I hate to see people in pain. Get him out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What about Vitti?</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: He’s a hard man to kill. But he’s not
immortal. Our time will come.</p>
<p><strong>ext. back-yard swimming pool - day</strong>: A big, family
barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens. Several children are
splashing in an over-sized, above-ground swimming pool. Oddly, the
children appear to be shouting and laughing but make no sound. At the
barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend MELLO turn Italian sausage
on the grill.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I like mine burnt.</p>
<p><strong>mello</strong>: I don’t know how you like your sausage?
Twenty fuckin’ years we been doin’ this. So you got the money?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: Not all of it. I’m still light about fifteen
large. Can we cut? This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Cut! Can you do something about the fucking
smoke?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: This is the problem with shooting on
location. But it’s worth it for the authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, this is real authentic.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Tony! Come here a second. Anthony Bella. He
plays Nicky Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I know who he is. They used to watch the show
up at Sing Sing.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Are you shitting me?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Tony, this is Paul Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: You don’t have to tell me who he is.
It’s a pleasure, mate.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Mate? I don’t believe this! You’re an English
guy? You ain’t even Italian.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Australian-Italian. We got some paisans
down under.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Down under what?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: How incredible is this? Paul tells me they
watch the show in Sing Sing!</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Fantastic! That’s so fuckin’ great.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I wouldn’t wet my pants over it. They watch
‘Supermarket Sweep,’ too.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You laugh too much.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: So, Paul, you going to join us?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. You got a good setup here.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Great. See you later then.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Coupla things, though. I don’t know who makes
these decisions, but some of this, it don’t look right.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I sensed it myself. Which elements strike you
as wrong?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The people mainly. I mean, you got a boss who
speaks Australian. What the fuck is that? And I’m guessing your</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: The theater, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, the theater. So how about if I bring in
some guys that I know – you know, more ‘authentic.’</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I would be eternally grateful. Anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. One of those trailers like the stars
have.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Done. I’ll put that in the works right
now.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You really gonna do this?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No fuckin’ way. I’ve had it with this job
bullshit. A week of this and I’d either shoot myself or shoot Raoul. But
it’s good cover while I figure out my next move. Call the guys.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Jelly and Vitti’s old crew, MO-MO, BIGS,
TUNA, EDDIE COKES, and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into

<p><strong>int. knights of palermo - later</strong>: Ben enters
timorously, still carrying his groceries. Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a

<p><strong>masiello</strong>: You’re the shrink who’s taking care of
Paul Vitti?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, sir. That’s right. Could you be careful,
because I think they put the eggs on the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: So? Is he nuts or what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Paulie. Is he nuts?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t discuss a patient’s case with anyone
–</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d say he’s still suffering from chronic
anxiety and –</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: And what.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We call it Antisocial Personality Disorder.
Sociopathy.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Meaning – he – fails to conform to societal
norms with respect to – lawful behavior.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: I’m getting a fuckin’ headache here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He’s got a – criminal temperament.</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: He’s a criminal? This is news? And for
that you need a doctor degree? So what are you doin’ with him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I’m trying to at least show him the
possibility of change –</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Wrong. You do not want him to change.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We haven’t really been introduced –</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: This is Mrs. LoPresti.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Patty.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ben Sobel.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Ben, Paul Vitti is important to this family.
We don’t want to see you turn him into a stromboni.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A stromboni? That thing they clean the ice with
at hockey games?</p>
<p><strong>masiello</strong>: That’s a Zamboni, asshole. Stromboni.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: It’s a bull with his balls cut off.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, we don’t want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Not unless you want to be one, too.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Me? No. I’m very attached to my balls. As you
can probably tell.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Then do the right thing, understand?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, I understand completely. May I go now? I
have perishables –</p>
<p><strong>int. “little caesar” set - day</strong>: Vitti is sitting at
a table with Jelly and some of his main guys. From a distance it looks
like they’re playing cards. Up close it’s a different story.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: We’re gonna need a grapple or a crane with
maybe a fifty-foot boom.</p>
<p><strong>mo-mo</strong>: I seen one – in Bayonne – but I’ll call
around.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: See what you can come up with. And we’re
gonna need a city bus.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I got a guy in the Transit Authority. He owes
me. Just let me know when.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Paul! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: I guess everybody’s gone Hollywood, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: How you doin’, Patty.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Jelly – you’re working here, too?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I’m an extra.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: An extra what?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: A supernumerary. An ‘atmosphere.’ It ain’t
bad. You just stand around all day waitin’ for them to shoot and they
pay you eighty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Eighty bucks? For standin’ around all day?
You used to sneeze eighty bucks. How much you make shootin’ craps?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Today? About eight hundred maybe.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: And how about bookin’ bets for the Teamsters
and the crew?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Another grand. One of the producers really
likes the ponies.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: So eighteen hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Plus eighty –</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: I know – extra.</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: This is a closed set. We’re
about to start shooting.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah? So am I.</p>

<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: No, pull the car up your ass and wait
there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. set - same time</strong>: Patty takes Vitti’s arm and
walks with him.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: I heard you had some more trouble.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: One of Rigazzi’s guys took a shot at me.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: I don’t have to tell you, Paul. Alone on the
street you don’t stand a chance. That’s what the family’s all about.
Since the old days, when the grandfathers first came over. That’s not
something you just walk away from.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I know. When you’re a Jet, you’re a Jet
all the way.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: So you want to tell me what’s going on here?
It looks like you got your whole crew back together.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Nothing’s going on. They’re actors.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Don’t bullshit me, Paul. You’re planning
something. I’m feeling very left out.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay. Something big is going down, but you’re
getting a cut. My hand to God.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: You’re a good friend, Paul. And I would never
think of insisting on this, but I’d feel better if you brought in Eddie
and some of my guys to help with the job.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Then I’ll have to insist.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Oh, dear God. First of all, sweetheart, we’re
not shooting the hooker scene until tomorrow. And the hair – please,
what is that?</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Raoul, this is a friend of mine. Patty
LoPresti.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Mrs. LoPresti – I am so very, very</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: How dare you not inform me Mrs. LoPresti was
on the set. You’re fired! Enjoy your visit with us. If there’s anything
I can do –</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: It’s good to have you back, Paul.</p>

men walk away down one aisle of trucks and campers, Rigazzi and his men
walk down the next aisle heading for the set. They narrowly miss seeing
each other.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base camp - moments later</strong>: Ben arrives looking
for Vitti. He sees Patty approaching and freezes, then quickly ducks
behind a nearby truck, shielding his crotch. Patty and her men pass by.
Ben waits until they pass, then comes out of hiding and hurries on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. back-yard set - same time</strong>: A mildly-distraught
Raoul is huddled with Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I mean, tell me – was she angry? Am I in any
danger?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, you’re fine. But you might want to have
somebody else start your car the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I’ll have Brian do it. He’s new.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Could I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Oh, what is this now, the bus and truck tour
of Guys and Dolls?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This is Lou Rigazzi.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: ‘The Wrench.’</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Please, forgive me. I’m on painkillers – half
the time I don’t know what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Certainly. Brian! Get my car!</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: I need a couple minutes.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>ext. craft services table - moments later</strong>: Vitti and
Rigazzi stand at the table. Rigazzi’s soldiers are nearby.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: The guy who shot at you – he was acting on
his own. I never gave an order.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: And he’s been taken care of. There won’t be
another incident. Unless you’re thinkin’ of workin’ for Patty
LoPresti.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Me? No.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Good. Then I got no beef with you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Thanks. I’ll sleep much better.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Because that would not be the way to go.
You want to back a winner, which is gonna be me. It only makes sense.
You come work for us. I’ll treat you right.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>rigazzi</strong>: Well, so much for sleeping better.</p>
<p><strong>int. extras holding tent - same time</strong>: Ben walks in
and sees Vitti’s guys sitting around.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Hey, Dr. Sobel?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jelly, hi. Hey! Yo-Yo!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: It’s Mo-Mo.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right. I was thinking of the cellist. How’s it
going?</p>
<p><strong>mo-mo</strong>: Goin’ good. I did a ‘Law and Order’ last
week, I had a line on ‘Sex and the City’ –</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: I’m up for a recurring on ‘NYPD Blue.’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s great. Have you seen Paul?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Yeah, I think he’s in his camper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: His camper.</p>
<p><strong>int. vitti’s trailer - moments later</strong>: There’s a loud
KNOCK on the door and Ben storms in.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, what are you doing here? I came to tell you
we have a preliminary meeting with your parole officer and who do I run
into? Patty LoPresti.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Patty who?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What is this – a knock-knock joke?
Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened- to-cut-off-my-balls. Stop lying
to me, Paul. Your whole gang is here.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Who says I’m lying? I finally get a straight
job and start putting my life in order and you come in here and start
accusing me! That’s how much you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not that I don’t trust you, I just don’t –
trust you. Are you lying to me? Because I know you, Paul. You’ll say or
do anything to get your own way.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: This is what’s so hard about being an ex-con.
You make one little mistake in your life and people never let you forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, so now you’re the victim? I want the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Wait a second. Say that again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ‘I want the truth.’ Say it – like you did
just now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I want the truth?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, strong, like before.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I want the truth!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, that’s good!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, I’m serious. That had power. I believed
it. You could be an actor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not an actor –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, you’re as good as most of the bums I see
around here. They have this part. You could do it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth
grade.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Of course. I’m gonna talk to Raoul.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: About being on the show? I couldn’t - -</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, this part you could do. It’s perfect.
Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. apartment building - day</strong>: The camera rolls.</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: We’re rolling.</p>
<p><strong>soundman</strong>: Sound speed.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Action!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Does that screaming sound real to you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Oh, yeah. That sounds real.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s car - later</strong>: Ben drives, pissed off.
Vitti chuckles to himself.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not funny! There was no safety harness or
anything. They could have dropped me.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, if you didn’t want to do it, why didn’t
you say something?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know exactly what that was about. You resent
the fact that you’ve been put in my custody, so you passive-
aggressively arranged things to make me look like a fool.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Come on – you were great.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really? I was scared at first, but on the
second take, I think I found some good stuff. I was able to texture the
screaming –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, screw you, Paul. Just screw you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What, are you self-medicating again? And
don’t give that decongestant multi-vitamin bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t worry about me. Just worry about what
you’re going to say to this parole officer. What are you going to say?
That you’ve moved out of my house. That you’ve got your old gang back
together. For what, a high school drop-out reunion?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m gonna say that’s none of his fuckin’
business.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s my business. I want to know. I’m a federal
institution.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You recognize that car?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Which car?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The one that’s been following us the last
mile and a half.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Lose ’em.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean, ‘lose ’em’?</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s car - continuous action</strong>: Ben is on the
edge of panic.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe I should just pull over. It could be the
F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, they’re two cars back. You gotta be a
little more observant, Doc. Turn left.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What if we just stop and get out? They’re not
going to shoot us in broad daylight.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Broad daylight’s the best time. You can see
better. Take a right. Now!</p>
<p><strong>ext. hoboken street - continuous action</strong>: Pedestrians
scatter as Ben makes a sudden turn into a bank drive-thru. He
over-steers and wipes out an ATM machine, sending up a cloud of bills
that flutter down like confetti.</p>

bystanders run to pick up the cash, blocking the drive-thru, forcing
Miller in the FBI car to stop.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hoboken street - moments later</strong>: Two police
officers are parked at the curb. They hear a HORN HONKING, and turn just
as Ben’s car comes flying past them. The cops start to pull out but stop
short as the Benz blows</p>

is a lease!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s a goddamn lease!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Move over. I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Move over? Where?</p>

<p><strong>ext. industrial park - moments later</strong>: Ben’s car
bounces over some railroad tracks and sails into a warehouse complex on

<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Throw it!</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - continuous action</strong>: Vitti throws a
180, SKIDDING to a stop just inches from the river’s edge. The Benz,
with the newspaper covering the windshield, sails past them and right
off the embankment. It seems to hang in the air for a long time, then
lands with a big splash and starts to sink almost immediately.</p>
<p><strong>ben and vitti</strong>: They jump out of the car and watch
the Mercedes disappear under the water.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think they’ll get out?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, that’s James Bond and the ‘Sea Hunt’
guy in there, so they got a pretty good shot.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I gotta take care of something.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But your parole officer –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Send my regrets.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m warning you. If you leave now –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So long, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s it! I’m finished! You’re on your own
now, pal! I’m –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: – screwed.</p>

sunken Mercedes in the middle of the channel. On shore, Ben leans

berates him.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Where is he, Dr. Sobel?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Well, considering that he’s in your custody,
that’s not quite the answer I was looking for. He’s got something big in
the works. You want to tell me what you know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know anything. As far as I can tell,
he’s making a real effort to go straight.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Yeah, that’s why I’ve got two corpses at the
bottom of the river.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Here. Vitti with Sal Masiello. Vitti with
Patty LoPresti. Vitti with Lou Rigazzi. Let me know – I can order some
wallet size for you. I’ve got more than enough to put him away again
without these. Violation of parole, second-degree murder here. When I
really start digging, it’ll be amazing</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m getting that. Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: You can’t take your car. We’re impounding it
as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then can somebody give me a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Yeah, the government runs a limousine
service. The number is 1-800-Fuck Off.</p>
<p><strong>int. vitti’s trailer - day</strong>: Vitti is hurriedly
collecting his stuff, talking to Jelly and a few of his old gang.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t have a lot of time. They’re probably
gonna come lookin’ for me, so we’ll go over everything later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Paul, not that I’m questioning, but what do
we want with Eddie DeVol? Guy’s a fuckin’ scumbag.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Look, I’m not happy about it, but if it keeps
Patty off my back, so be it. They’re meeting us at the club. Let’s head
out. Not all at once. I gotta tell you everything?</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Mr. Vitti? Mr. Bella asked if you could meet
him in the makeup trailer.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, I gotta go.</p>

important.</p>
<p><strong>int. makeup trailer - moments later</strong>: Vitti watches
impatiently while the makeup artist touches up Tony Bella.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: I’m looking for something to do when my
character finds out he’s being indicted. I was thinking of punching the
wall, but I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny, and I did it
again</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Try kickin’ something. Let me know how it
works out.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Wait, Paul. That’s interesting. Like
what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t know. You could kick a guy in the
face.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Just some guy! You knock him down, give him a
couple quick kicks in the head while he’s on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Why not? Because he’s there and you’re pissed
off.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: You’ve done that?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Maybe once or twice. Look, I got people
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: My character wouldn’t do that. What
else?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I don’t know. You could yell real loud?</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Yell real loud? That’s original.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Or keep your fuckin’ mouth shut! Who gives a
shit what you do, for cryin’ out loud?</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin’
out loud?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: What are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay, you can cut that shit out right
now.</p>

that.</p>

you look in that suit. What’s the job?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m working for Mr. Vitti. I’m his
driver.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, no, you’re not!</p>

driving a getaway car!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s paying me twenty dollars an hour.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t care if he pays you two hundred an
hour, you’re not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dad –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He had no right to ask you without my
permission. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean you can’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I promised I’d never repeat anything I

<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tonight, I hope. I just have to find him and
–</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why? A few days ago you weren’t even sure you
still wanted to be a therapist. Now you’re going to risk your life again
for that lout.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah, but he’s an amazing lout, isn’t he? I
can’t quit now. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Go. Just don’t get shot – please?</p>

modified ’82 Honda Civic with the</p>
<p><strong>int. civic - continuous action</strong>: Ben takes out a
bottle of pills. He tries to remove the child-safety cap but his hands
are shaking so badly he can’t do it. Frustrated, he tries to bite the
cap off, then gives up and throws the bottle away.</p>
<p><strong>ext. little darling’s - same time</strong>: Ben enters the
club. A moment later, Cerrone and Miller cruise by in an unmarked car
and park at the end of the block.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jelly!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Hey, Doc. What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’s Paul?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I think she likes you, Doc. Give her a couple
of bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can you break a twenty?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do I just make my own change?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A ten and five ones – when you have the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay, Paul, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I could ask you the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What’s it look like? We’re just blowin’ off a
little steam. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How’s it goin’, Paulie? You know my guys –
Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Al Pacino? That’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>al pacino</strong>: No. People call me that because I look
like Al Pacino. The actor.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?</p>
<p><strong>al pacino</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: ’Cause you look about as much like Carol
Burnett as you look like Al Pacino.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I do see a little Pacino there – around the
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So we’re all here. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s do what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not going until you tell me what’s going on
here.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Don’t make me hurt you. Get the fuck out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>int. basement room - moments later</strong>: Vitti is seated
at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled room. Jelly sits at his
side. He’s surrounded by his crew, about a half-a-dozen guys, and
Patty’s man, Eddie DeVol. Several street maps and diagrams are spread
out on the table.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay, this is big and we only get one shot at
it; and there’s only about a million ways this fuckin’ thing can go bad,
so listen up.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: The Federal Gold Depository in Lower
Manhattan. Three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a
heavily-guarded armored truck from the Depository to the vault at the
Federal Reserve to hold for foreign governments that trade in bullion.
At three o’clock in the morning – eight hours from now –we’re gonna
hijack that truck.</p>
<p><strong>int. little darling’s - same time</strong>: Ben enters the
back room of the club, looks around, and starts down the stairwell
leading to the basement.</p>
<p><strong>int. basement room - continuous action</strong>: Ben hits the
floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from the guys. Enormous Bobby
pulls Ben off the floor by his lapels.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>enormous bobby</strong>: I found this guy listening at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, guys. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ben Sobel. Sorry, I can’t move my head to the
right. Boy, I hope that’s not permanent.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hi, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>al pacino</strong>: You’re a dead man, asshole. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you think? He can make every guy in
this room.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, I’m not into that, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Get your fuckin’ hands off him! He’s with
me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What, on the job?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Either he’s in, or he’s dead. Which is
it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think in is better.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: He’s in. He’s my responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Okay, no more surprises. And from this moment
on, no one leaves my sight. Got it? Now go through it one more time.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Okay – everybody listen up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait! Okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. little darling’s - later that night</strong>: Agents
Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from their car parked
across the street.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: I wonder what it costs to keep that many
limos waiting for three-and-a- half hours.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: A dozen men looking like Vitti and his
crew come out of the club and get into the limos.</p>

intently.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Where’s Vitti? I don’t see Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>cerrone</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>int. manhattan warehouse - middle of night</strong>: Vitti’s
guys are dressed like construction workers as they load their gear into
two trucks. Vitti supervises while others work on a New York City bus.
Eddie DeVol, Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby stand guard over the whole
scene, in case anyone is thinking of defecting. Ben is wearing heavy
dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt, struggling to lace his work
boots. Jelly approaches him and tosses a bulletproof vest on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Here. See if this’ll fit under your
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I could fit you under my shirt. Don’t they have
anything smaller?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: This ain’t Bloomingdale’s. Nobody knew you
were comin’. You’re lucky you’re alive, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nobody’s going to be alive when this is over.
What kind of plan is this? It’s crazy. It’s stupid!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Watch it. It may be crazy but it ain’t
stupid. If you want to stay alive, just keep your mouth shut, do
everything I tell you and try not to pee in your pants. Can you handle
an M-16?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean shoot it?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: No, I mean twirl it like a fuckin’ baton. How
about an A.K.?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jelly –</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Kalashnikov, MAC-10, Uzi – stop me if I hit
one you like.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Couldn’t I just take this?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Yeah, that’s a good one. That gun brings back
a lot of fond memories. Use it in good health.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ooh, cold – cold.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My gun – fell down in my –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Check the bus.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: If we can, I’m gonna get you out before the
real shit goes down. Just don’t flip out on me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You are making a huge mistake. You know that,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You said it yourself. It’s my nature.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not your nature! You have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket? I don’t
know what planet you live on, but here on Earth it’s ‘might makes
right.’ Read the papers. The guys with the guns make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So I guess that makes me a real man now. What
happened to the white hat, Paul? Your father wasn’t wrong. You could be
one of the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Enough. Say one more word about my father and
I’ll break your fuckin’ head.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - same time</strong>: Vitti comes in, locks the
door and has a full-blown panic attack – gasping for breath, sweating,
whimpering, trying to stifle his panic. Then he sees his tortured face
in the mirror and starts pulling himself together.</p>
<p><strong>int. warehouse - few minutes later</strong>: The guys are
getting into the trucks. Ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him,
then starts to back away, but Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind
him and push him up into the truck.</p>
<p><strong>int. lead truck - same time</strong>: The guys are sitting on
the floor in the back of the truck, lined up along the sides like
paratroopers waiting to jump. Ben is sitting next to Jelly and across
from Vitti who is just staring intently.</p>
<p><strong>ext. west side highway - night</strong>: The trucks make
their way past the aircraft carrier Intrepid heading downtown.</p>
<p><strong>ext. construction site - night</strong>: Vitti, Ben, and
Eddie DeVol stand next to the treads of a giant crane.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I have five to three. They should start
movin’ any minute.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have three-o-six.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Let’s see your watch.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: They’re moving!</p>
<p><strong>ext. federal building - night</strong>: A CONVOY of vehicles
emerges from the bowels of the building and turns onto the street. In
front and back are specially- equipped SUVs, full of heavily-armed
federal marshals; an armored truck in the middle carries the gold.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: He can hear the convoy passing outside the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: He looks down on the convoy from a vantage
point on a scaffold high above the street. When the trucks are in the
right position, he waves to Vitti on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: sees the signal.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - continuous action</strong>: A forty-foot,
flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement conduit backs across the
street and stops, blocking the path of the convoy. The lead SUV HONKS.
The truck doesn’t move. The CAPTAIN of the marshals gets out and walks
up to the truck. The driver has slipped out the other side and
disappeared. Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and
closes around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points crunching
into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising off the pavement. A
couple of determined marshals jump out of their vehicles, race over and
grab onto the bumpers as the armored truck is lifted off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ext. construction site - continuous action</strong>: A
hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The marshals hang
on as long as they can, then prudently let go and drop heavily to the
street. Two marshals are still clinging to the truck as it rises to a
height of thirty feet, then swings silently over the perimeter
fencing.</p>
<p><strong>int. construction site</strong>: A bank of arc lights is
switched on illuminating the site as the truck is lowered to the ground.
Heavily-armed gangsters in ski masks surround the truck and herd the
driver, the shotgun guard and the frightened marshals into a
construction shack, while men with acetylene torches attack the back
doors. Vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Paul, it’s not too late. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - same time</strong>: The marshals run around,
frantically searching for a way into the construction site.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Totally in charge, he strides up to the
armored truck just as his men finish cutting through the steel plate
doors. Vitti yanks the doors open.. Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the
exposed contents of the truck – a fortune in gold bars.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Get the ramp!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, this might just fuckin’ work.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re gonna get in so much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - same time</strong>: The marshals are trying to
climb over the construction site wall, but they’re stopped by rolls of
razor wire and SUPPRESSING FIRE from inside the site.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They can’t get over the wire.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Then knock down the gates!</p>
<p><strong>ext. construction site</strong>: The guys take the heavy bars
out of the armored truck and run them quickly along the rolling track
into the bus.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus - same time</strong>: Jelly is pulling on the hat
and jacket of a transit authority bus driver. The floor boards of the
bus have been lifted out and the guys are laying the gold bars in the
hollow under the floor.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Forty bars. That’s all we need.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How much is that?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: $350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound, 90
pounds in each bar – do the math.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Actually, gold is measured in troy ounces.
14.6 ounces to the pound. That would be… $18,396,000.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, so much for not peeing in my pants.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - same time</strong>: The marshals back up one of
the SUVs and run it into the gates again.</p>
<p><strong>int. construction site</strong>: The big, wooden GATES
SHUDDER but Vitti’s men roll two enormous earthmovers up to reinforce
the gates.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You know what you said about not flipping
out?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sorry. What did I do? What did I do? I had a
perfect life, I threw it away.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t help it! My life is over! I’m going to
jail. Some people can handle prison – I’m not one of them. I have
delicate features. I’m small. I’ll be way too popular!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t calm down! I’m gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You’re not gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t breathe! I’m suffocating!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: For Chrissake, get hold of yourself!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t! I’m dying! We’re all going to die!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did I just hit you?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah. Feel better now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry, Paul. I blame myself for this. I
wanted to help you. I wanted to be there for you. But I just wasn’t good
enough.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: You were good. It isn’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, it is. Since my father died – I’ve lost my
way. I don’t know anything anymore. I mean, what’s the point? I didn’t
think it would hit me so hard –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Would you just shut up about your father!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m grieving, goddammit! Have a little
respect!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: He was an asshole – you said it yourself.
What are you grieving for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m grieving for myself, you fucking idiot!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Jeez, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now I know how you must have felt when your
father was killed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean, it had to be ten times worse for you –
being murdered right in front of you. And you were so young - -</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: We don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It must’ve been so painful!</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m warning you – don’t do this –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean, it’s like all his hopes for you died
with him. And that’s so sad.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: There I go. You happy now? You see what
you’re doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Your father really loved you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I loved him, too. I did.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Oh, boy. This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Maybe we oughta should go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Did you really think you were gonna live
through this?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I had my hopes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, well, nice work. Mr. Rigazzi will be
very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Rigazzi? I thought he worked for Patti
LoPresti.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: That’s what Patty thought, too. This
scumbag’s been playin’ both sides against the middle.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There’s only one side as far as I’m
concerned. Mine. What did you think? I was just gonna stand by and let
some fuckin’ has-been move back in? So long, Mr. Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t take it anymore! That’s what I hate
about you fucking sociopaths! You just keep changing the rules to suit
yourselves. Well, not this time, you anti-social asshole. You fucked
with the wrong shrink!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t you read the papers? The guy</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: On the floor! Face-down! Now!</p>
<p><strong>al pacino</strong>: Nice goin’. Good plan.</p>
<p><strong>enormous bobby</strong>: What’s a sociopath?</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: They’re escaping out the back! Get over
there! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>next block</strong>: As the marshals round the corner, they
see a police shoot-out in progress. Wiseguys are FIRING AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS at cops who are pinned down behind police cruisers. The Captain
of the marshals FIRES a warning SHOT in the air.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Freeze! Drop your weapons!</p>
<p><strong>tony bella</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Cut, cut, cut! What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Who are you? What are you doing in my
shot?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What are you doing on my street?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I have a permit!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t give a shit about your permit!</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: All right, people. Back to one
and let’s try it again! Release the traffic and reset for another
take.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 11th avenue - minutes later</strong>: In mid-block, SWAT
cops step into the street and wave the bus to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s it. We’re screwed.</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>lead swat</strong>: You’re one tough shrink.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - continuous action</strong>: The bus pulls out
and joins the flow of traffic heading downtown.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus - minutes later</strong>: All the guys are looking
pretty happy with their score. Ben turns to Vitti.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Feeling pretty good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I felt worse.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So what now? You go on the run for the rest of
your life? Back to Sing Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Those are my choices? What happened to lying
on a beach in Costa Rica for the next twenty years? You can’t let me
enjoy this for five fuckin’ minutes?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Five minutes? And then what?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: And then what? I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rigazzi plumbing and heating - next morning</strong>: A
Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led by Agent
Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars. Agent Cerrone comes out of
the building with Lou Rigazzi and several associates in handcuffs. U.S.
Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media.</p>
<p><strong>chapin</strong>: Acting on intelligence we developed in the
last few days, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. took very
aggressive action to recover the stolen gold and bring the perpetrators
to justice. I’m happy to tell the people of New York that the streets
are safe again.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patty’s house - same time</strong>: Vitti knocks on the
front door. Patty answers it in her robe.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Hi, Paul. How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Not so good.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Yeah, I heard. It’s all over the television.
I never should’ve trusted Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone in the
world is very vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: At least I don’t have to worry about the
Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I told you – I just want to be left</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: I know. I’ll make sure. How about some
breakfast? I could make you some waffles and – whatever else you
want.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>patty</strong>: Well, if you ever change your mind – Good
luck, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>ext. east river boardwalk - later morning</strong>: Ben is
leaning against the railing gazing at the water when Vitti walks up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you see Patti?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did she grab your balls?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: What kind of question is that? She’s cool.
She’s just happy to have ‘the Wrench’ out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I talked to the U.S. Attorney.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Did he grab your balls?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, Paul, he did not grab my balls. He thanked
me for tipping him off about the gold. And he said he won’t be coming
after you if you stay out of trouble. So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: I’m gonna go to Ohio – get Marie and the kids
– then we’ll probably disappear for awhile – figure out all</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good idea. Change is hard, Paul. But you did
the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, you, too. You hung in there. That took
a lot of guts.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I just –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No, you were like an animal back there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just vented my displaced aggression</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No. I’m telling you. You’re a monster. I saw
the beast in you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not a beast. I can handle myself if I have
to –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Handle yourself? You were fuckin’ John
Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I wrestled a bit in high school – 122
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Yeah, I could tell. You’re good, you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Paul, I just –</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: No. You are good. You got a gift, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Fine. I have a gift.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: So – happy ending, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I think so. Don’t you feel better
now?</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Are you kidding? I feel like shit. All that
work for nothing. 20 million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re grieving – it’s a process.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Take it easy, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You, too, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>vitti</strong>: Hey, Doc! ‘There’s a place for us –’</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: ‘A time and place for us –’</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: ‘Hold my hand we’re halfway there –’</p>
<p><strong>all together</strong>: ‘Hold my hand and I’ll take you there.
Somehow, someday, somewhere.’</p>
