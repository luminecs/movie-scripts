Monkey King a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life</p>
<p><strong>first draft</strong>: 2/10/95</p>
<p><strong>underwater - close-up</strong>: A brightly colored FLY,
attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly.
The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite.</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Doctor Jones!… Doctor Jones !…</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: We need your assistance!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: C’mon, Mac… It’s the first bite I’ve had

<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Please… It’s very importantl…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Do you value our friendship, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: More than me’ nightly pint.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Then this better not be some wild goose
chase…</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: T’ain’t wild geese we’re after, Doctor
Jones. You got me’ word on that… …and a MacGowan’s word is truer than an
angel’s kiss!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Scotty Ferguson.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He’s the eighth.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Just like the others…all his bones
busted…crushed…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Whatever’s killin’ people around here ain’t
human.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s there! Again!</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: That light…only burns after a murder’s
been committed.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Well… Ahmmmm…that is what we’re here
for…eh, men?…ah… Hennesey… Galbraith… Bottomley… You’re comin’ with
us.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: May God help them.</p>
<p><strong>hennesey</strong>: It’s deathly cold in ‘ere. How could a
human bein’ survive?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This guy’s got one hell of an ego.</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say ’e
walks the moors every midnight… others claim e’s been dead for
years…</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Hennesey?… Hennesey?…</p>
<p><strong>galbraith</strong>: ‘E was standin’ right ‘ere! Just a second
ago… Standin’ right beside me!…</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Thanks for catchin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’d rather be catchin’ trout.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Interesting blood type…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.</p>
<p><strong>galbraith</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Galbraith… You come with me! We’ll search
for Hennesey… Out here! Bottomley… You go with Doctor Jones… In
there.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Let’s get outta’ here.</p>
<p><strong>bottomley</strong>: Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open the
door!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I need more light.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Bottomley?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Bottomley?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Who is it?… Who’s there?…</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Doctor Jones! Try to push!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Can’t! There’s some kinda’ hot ice coverin’
the…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: NOW they bite!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Excuse me, sir…? Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Canyou hear me?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Listen, pal… There are two dead Policemen
upstairs and…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Chow time’s over, mister. You better start
talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There’s a lot of strange things happening
around here…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: …and I want some answers! Do you hear me? I
want some answers! Now!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Haven’t you had enough?</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Now you can get back to your fishing,
Doctor Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in the
morning. Vacation’s over. Gotta’ get back to school.</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: ‘Tis a shame to go home empty handed… Tell
ya’ what, my friend… I fancy me’self quite the fisherman… Tomorrow, I’ll
go out and catch you a real beauty, eh?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Right. Send it to me airmail.</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: Doctor Jones! A MacGowan’s word is truer
than…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yeah, yeah…an angel’s kiss. I know.</p>
<p><strong>baron seagrove</strong>: No…jail…can…hold…me.</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: ’E’s done it! Indiana Jones has captured
the killer!</p>
<p><strong>macgowan</strong>: What is it, man? You look as if you’ve
seen a screamin’ banshee!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Ah… It was nothing, Mac. Nothing at
all.</p>
<p><strong>instruments</strong>: animal and bird skeletons, fossils,
primitive statues, etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a
mountain of TERM PAPERS, is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three
piece suit and circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a
STUDENT SEAT ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term
papers. He furiously GRADES each paper.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Doctor Jones… I took your class instead of
all the others!… I coulda’ had Professor Needles… Professor
Eisenschmidt… Professor…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You promised. You said you’d have ’em graded
by yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: My paper finished yet? Name’s “Virgil
Vektor”. That’s VIRGIL. Capital V… I… R…</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: My parents paid good money to send me here.
You know how much they shelled out for your class?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: He doesn’t care about us. He only wants
fame and fortune. We’re just a buncha’ peons to him.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: VEKTOR. Capital V… E… K…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hello, Ind – Doctor Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Not now, Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: LOOK at all of those papers!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Please, I…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Want me to come by later? Help you grade?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Help me grade. Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Goodbye, Ind – Doctor Jones!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Didja’ get the name? VIRGIL! Capital</p>
<p><strong>priestly</strong>: Moby Dick.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Huh?…</p>
<p><strong>priestly</strong>: That’s what I named ’im. Captain said it
was the biggest fish he ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>priestly</strong>: What about you, Jonesey? You were over in
Scotty-land for two weeks… Didja’ catch the big one?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look, Priestly… I’m real busy…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Two-timing bastard!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: How could you?!?… My own Mother?!?… In my
own bed?!?… I’ve had it with you! It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>postman</strong>: Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: Doctor Jones, I’ve had complaints
from several of the students –</p>
<p><strong>postman</strong>: Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: They feel that you are ignoring them,
that you are distracted…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Me?… Distracted?…</p>
<p><strong>postman</strong>: What’s this? “B+”? That’s how you sign your
name?</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: Marshall University is not the place
for sloppy behavior…</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: I have one final warning for you,
Doctor Jones –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes… Oh, Hello, Marcus… Look, can you hold
on?… You were saying, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: Either you begin concentrating on
your –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, Marcus… I’m still here… Just hold on!
I’m very sorry, sir…</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: – concentrating on your teaching
duties or –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Damn it, Marcus! I’m standing here with
Dean… What?.. Just how important?… It is, huh?… Okay. Five minutes.
Yeah. I’ll be right over. But this better be important, Marcus!</p>
<p><strong>dean coventry</strong>: You are on probation, Jones! Ten
days! If there is no improvement, you will be dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I promise…by tomorrow…I’ll have all of
these graded…and DRIED!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V… I…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This better be important, Marcus… or the
museum will soon be displaying my bones. My teaching career is in danger
of extinction.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You will not be disappointed, Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor
features an upright, wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING.
But the monkey is NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN… HALF
MONKEY. His face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears
a LION SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung
stands amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded
by a HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening
in the CLOUDS.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …Look familiar?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: “Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey King”. Big
deal. That was ten years ago, Marcus. Geez! This Heller kid’s got the
worst grammar.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ten years or fifty years. It will always be
in your blood.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t believe this… He spells “repeat” with
two “E’s”.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Think back, Indiana. Remember your desire?
Your passion?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Kid gets an “A” on content…a “D” on
form.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Damn it, man! You can’t bury those feelings
forever!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Two years. Nearly two years of my
life…looking for the remains of that Monkey…a piece of his legendary
Golden Hooped Rod…or some sign of the Lost City. Nine men perished on
the journey. Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many
horrible deseases we discovered… We still came back empty handed.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: One mustn’t give up so easily, Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Give up?!?… Marcus, we spent thirteen
months in China!…another seven in India!…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: But none in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There was no proof…archeological or
anthropological…to indicate that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited Africa…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Until now.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hey… My papers…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The famous
zoologist. She works in Africa, studying animals in their natural
habitat.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Very interesting, Marcus. Now if you’ll
turn the lights back on –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke discovered that
cute little fellow… “Tyki”…a pygmy of an unusual race…unrelated to any
known African tribe…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Marcus. The lights.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes from the
Lost Civilization of Sun Wu-Kung.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What?… But how did Miss –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: “Doctor”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: “Doctor” Clake. How did she arrive at such
a preposterous hypothesis?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The pygmy speaks in a language that has no
African origins…but bears a strong resemblance to Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Means nothing. The rivers of Africa have
been plagued by various Oriental Pirates and Scavengers since the 16th
Century. Not much evidence, Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There’s more. The pygmy was found wearing an
ornamental peach stone around his neck…believed to come from Sun
Wu-Kung’s legendary Garden Of Immortal Peaches.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Marcus, there are countless undiscovered
African tribes…all with various obscure beliefs and practices… One tribe
may wear peach stones… another may wear banana peels…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There is one final bit of evidence…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The pygmy is over 200 years old.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dr. Clarke has done a considerable amount of
testing on the pygmy’s clothing…his sandals…everything was over 200
years old.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He’s probably wearing his Great
Grandfather’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What does all of this have to do with
me?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dr. Clarke wants to mount an expedition to
find the Lost City of Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar with your
reputation…she’d like you to come along.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No chance.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There will be money involved… The museum is
willing to fund the expedition…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sorry, Marcus. I’ve burned this bridge.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Indiana…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Marcus. Please. I’ve got to finish
these…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’ve got to finish something much more
important. You crossed the threshold over a decade ago…and it’s been
tearing at your insides ever since. My friend, if there is even one iota
of truth in Dr. Clarke’s findings… then you can lift the veil of mystery
that has surrounded this Chinese legend for Centuries. You may uncover
the secrets to a Lost Civilization…and possibly, to man’s never ending
search for immortality.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Indiana… Can you afford to pass up the
single most important adventure of your life?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You can’t do this to me!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: C’mon, Betsy. Relax. You’re gettin’ ’em all
wet again.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You just can’t go away…I mean… Africa is so
far away, and…well… I love you, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thought we agreed this was s’posed to be
casual…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You call what happened last night
“casual”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: My dear…a momentary lapse into passion does
not a love affair make.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Momentary lapse! So that’s all I am to
you!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Betsy… Wait…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Whatsa’ matter with you!… Tryin’ to ruin my
whip!…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: If I can’t have you… I don’t want to
live.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Drink this. You’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: C’mon, Betsy… Get a hold of yourself.
You’re young. There are a lot of other guys…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Not like you.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s true… But that’s no reason to stop
living! Besides, I’m too old for you. By the time you’re seventy five,
I’ll be… Yeccchhh! I’ll be disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING.
Moving CLOSER and CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO
THE FLOOR. Betsy LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy
SHAKES the bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is
nearly HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls…the urn will CRUSH Betsy’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t leave me, Indy!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look… You’re just a flighty kid. Twenty
minutes after I walk out this door, you’ll have a date with the college
Romeo. Two hours from now, you’ll be madly in love with him. By
tomorrow, you’ll forget I ever existed.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Never underestimate the determination of a
Brooklyn girl, Doctor Jones. Never.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Indy! At last we are reunited! Oh,
Keechingo, God Of Friendship…I thank you for granting my wish!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I see you haven’t changed, Scraggy.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say… “Before
body make contact with foreign object…one must cast out bad spirits, or
–”</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: ” – or bad spirits will enter your
body!”</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Yes! You have excellent memory, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I should! Last time we saw each other…you
made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Never separate body from clothes, or bad
spirits will hide in pockets!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: In other words… If people never changed
clothes…there would be no evil in the world.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I missed all a’ your crazy philosophies,
Scraggy.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: They not so crazy, Indy. These days… There
is much evil in the air. I feel it. Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Are we making contact?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr. Jones?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Dr. Jones! Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Thought I was being attacked by a degenerate
sailor.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No. Just a degenerate archeologist.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Your appearance is deceiving.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Indiana Jones! Calling passenger Indiana
Jones!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: You left this aboard ship.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There must be some mistake… I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: That’s you, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Well, yeah…but…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of Goodness!
“Before body make contact with foreign object –”</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: “…you must cast out bad spirits!”</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: May I call you “Clare”?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Well, Clare… We’ve obviously got a lot of
notes to compare… Let’s get started tonight…over dinner.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: I’d like that very much.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Friend of mine owns a Cafe… He’ll get us a
nice quiet table. No disturbances. Just the two of us –</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: I warn you, Indy! You must always cast out
bad spirits!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: My precious!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: My assistant.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: His girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: A child!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s nothing. Really. What the hell are you
doing here’?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Proving my love for you.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: How terribly sordid.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She’ll get
over it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Never. This proves that nothing can come
between us. Not an ocean. Not two separate Continents.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Think I’m going to be ill.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: How…I mean… How could you stay alive?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hey… I’m from Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: But we’ye been sailing for three weeks!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Stowed away in the banana barrel. Ate my way
to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hey, Indy… Who’s the babe?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Your intellectual and emotional superior.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Yeah…well you’re gettin’ on my nerves, Miss…
Miss…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: “Doctor” Clare Clarke.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Betsy Tuffet…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: As in curds and whey?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Listen, sister… You better stay away from
Indy…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: My dear, he has no interest in me. I’ve
already celebrated my tenth Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look, Betsy… Why don’t you get back on the
boat… This time, as a passenger.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Too late, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: When’s the next one out?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: Were you successful?</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: Keep a record of everything that is
said.</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: Ever since our battle for the Lost Ark…
The feuhrer has been very interested in the adventures of Indiana Jones.
Very interested.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Tyki… This is Doctor Jones…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He’s a real gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Just basic manners. What it takes most men a
lifetime to learn… Tyki’s accomplished in two weeks. This is our guide,
Scraggy Brier… and Miss Bets–</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss
Tuffet’s Derfume… Eau De Banana Peel.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Where did you find him?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: About ten miles from here. We were on a
photographic expedition…in the thick of the jungle… I heard sounds.
Whimpering. Moaning. I took a few steps, and found Tyki. He was lying in
a shallow swamp…semi conscious…a high fever…nearly dead from exhaustion.
He had obviously been travelling on foot for many days, over countless
miles… So I brought him back to the compound…nursed him back to
health…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Clare, I hate to quibble with your
anthropological abilities…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Quibble.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: …but if this little fellow is over 200
years old… I mean… What accounts for his youthful appearance?…his
vitality?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Tyki was wearing this when I found him.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Dr. Jones, you are obviously familiar with
the legend of Sun Wu- King’s Garden of Immortal Peaches?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: A bite from the fruit of that peach tree
would give a person eternal life…make them forever young…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There’s nothing unusual about this …nothing
to indicate that it’s from Sun Wu Kung’s garden…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: This fruit fly had a normal life- span of
TWENTY FOUR HOURS. As an experiment…the fly was put in this
room…alone…with only the peach stone to sustain its existence. The fly
stayed alive for</p>
<p><strong>three weeks.</strong>: Until now.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: He understands him?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Scraggy knows hundreds of languages… He’s
the best guide in Africa. Ask Tyki where he came from.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say… “I come from ‘Land Of City On
Clouds’”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Huh?… What the hell’s that s’posed to mean?
Can he take us there?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say if he could… He would go back!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say “Pai Cho” may help you.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: “Pai Cho”?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of Sun Wu
Kung. His disciples always carry the Pai Cho with them…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Can you translate it?…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Get…him…off…of…me…!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: “Sun Wu Kung run like fire, He journey to
Many Monkey Land, To build his final empire.”</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Who’s Sun Wu-Kung?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Many Monkey Land… That’s a definite
reference to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Africa?… He journeyed to Africa?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: That confirms our suspicions that he may have
formed his Civilization here…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What civilization?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This doesn’t
concern you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this stuff
anyway! We’re in a nightclub. We should be havin’ fun. C’mon, Indy.
Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What a buncha’ stiffs! Bet you can’t
dance.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Quite the contrary…I spent several months
studying dance.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Oh yeah? Whattayou’ know?… The Bunny Hop?…
The Jitterbug?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The
Dungumaro.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: African Tribal dances.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Never heard of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Of course not. They’re beyond the spectrum of
your microscopic world.</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: Enjoying your dinners?…</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: Watch yourself, sport. Most of the talk
here tonight is about you. And it isn’t good.</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: I don’t know what you’ve done to the
Nazis. But they are certainly no friends of yours.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Who’s there?…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: “With his Golden Hooped Rod, And its
powerful lightning rays, Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave, Where he
live for 500 days.”</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: The Golden Hooped Rod?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: A heavenly staff with many different
powers…most notably, it had the ability to transform itself into
hundreds of objects… It remains the most priceless treasure of Sun Wu
Kung’s empire.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: And what is the…the Water Curtain Cave?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sun Wu Kung’s legendary hideout…an enormous
secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This proves that the Water Curtain Cave
exists in Africa… Does it mention anything about Sun Wu Kung’s
travels?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Only place called…“Twisted Snake
Water”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The Zarnbesi River! It has a reputation for
its deadly water snakes…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: It would have been Sun Wu Kung’s logical
path.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It will also be our logical path.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Please try to control that monstrous libido
of yours!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We have to get back to the compound. Tyki
may be in danger.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Get your hands off him.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: When I tell you… Hit the brakes!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Now, Scraggy!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: About time we had some fun!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Bad spirits have Indy! He in trouble! Big
trouble!</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Goodnight, Doctor Jones.</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: Scraggy said you might be needing some
help, sport.</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: Indy! Rollout!</p>
<p><strong>dashiell</strong>: You okay, sport?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Dash!…</p>
<p><strong>camera follows indiana, out of the water, as he climbs aboard
the</strong>: SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING.
Their backs turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING,
Indy GRABS one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH
to the stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The
other two Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What a romantic night!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Will they hurt Tyki?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: They know he’s important to us. They’ll use
him to bargain for this.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Indy, you smell so good! So masculine!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Will they be following us?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Every step of the way.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don’t shave.
It’s so sexy!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Pandoola, God of Purity, say… “Always stay
ten paces ahead of bad spirit”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Exactly. We can’t let the Nazis get to the
City first. If they do, they’ll wipe out one of the greatest
archeological finds in History!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: How ’bout a little goodnight kiss?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Mmmmm, Indy…you really know the way to a
girl’s heart!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: What is that awful aroma?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Scraggy’s takin’ a shower.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He believes that onions keep bad spirits
from entering his body.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: In all my years of anthropology… I’ve never
run across anyone or anything quite like Scraggy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He’s a rare breed. You’re looking very
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: You’re looking very lecherous.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Just tryin’ to be friendly.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Save it for the schoolgirls.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look, Clare… Betsy’s just an anxious
archeology student…she admires my work… Who can blame her?… But it’s
just some kinda’ hero worship thing…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I dreamed about our first night together!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’re writin’ this down?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: I’m keeping an accurate record of our
journey.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What’s that got to do with my personal
life?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Evidence. I plan on testifying at your child
molestation trial.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Why do I do this to myself?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Hey, lady…you’re s’posed to be a Doctor…you
got any cures for a hangover?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: The best I’ve heard was used by a New Zealand
Tribe… One part crushed owl skull…two parts rhino saliva…one part zebra
dandruff.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No, No… Get a cup of donkey sweat …two
spoons of skunk hair…and one pint of shredded lizard tongue.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: I always use family cure! Two spoons
chopped leeches… Half cup horse mucous…two quarts crocodile urine!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Ex…cuse…me…!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: How far we travel, Indy?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Almost 20 miles.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Any sign of the Nazis?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Long as we keep up this pace… they’ll have
trouble tracking us.</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: We must leave. Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t you know somethin’ else? Somethin’
upbeat?…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: It’s so hot… Stuffy… Do we have to stay on
this stupid boat all night?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We have to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Can we at least jump in the water?… Go for a
swim?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: There’s an old legend about the Zambesi… In
ancient times, criminals were given their choice of execution…or
swimming across the Zambesi. Most chose execution.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Clare’s right. We’ll be safer on the boat.
Now quit moanin’ and eat your food.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You are so rude! I travel thousands of miles
just to be with you…and everybody treats me like dirt! Nobody even talks
to me without making some condescending remark they think I’m too stupid
to understand! So maybe I don’t know a lot about weird tribal dances…
I’m still pretty good with anthropology and archeology… Maybe I could
even help you out…if somebody gave me a chance…clued me in to what it is
we’re doin’ here… ’Cause whether you like it or not, Indiana Jones… I’m
part of this expedition, too!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: My friends also curious about where we
journey to, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Long ago…a place known as the Flower Fruit
Mountain, in the Chinese province of Ao-Lai…was struck by lightning. A
Stone Monkey, “Sun Wu-Kung”, was born.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: This monkey?… He could walk?… Talk?… Like
human?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: More than human. He was blessed with
countless heavenly powers… But it wasn’t enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to
learn the secret of Eternal Life… of Immortality… Equipped with his
Golden Hooped Rod to protect him, Sun Wu Kung travelled the world for
many years …learning the secret philosophies and teachings of Eternal
Youth. Eventually, he was granted entrance to heaven…where the Jade
Emperor gave Sun Wu Kung the title of “Great Sage of the Heavens”…and
permitted him to oversee the Garden of Immortal Peaches. After several
years, the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth. Here, he ruled
an empire…a Civilization of Monkeys and humans who had life spans of
many hundred years… The exact whereabouts of that Lost City has been a
mystery for hundreds of years…until Doctor Clarke discovered the
pygmy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s uncertain just how much of this legend
is based in reality… Nevertheless, we’re hoping to find some sign of the
Lost Civilization.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What about Sun Wu Kung?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Whatever he was…a stone idol…an actual
monkey…a human being…is unknown. But he is one of the most influentual
religious figures in History, and his remains are most likely somewhere
in the Lost City.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: It is far, far away…many miles…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: What is it?… Some kinda’ weird animal?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: No animal sounds like that.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Could be “Banseebaba”.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Banseebaba?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Banseebaba is giant demon from hell. He is
50 feet tall. Breathes fire. Make sound like human never hear before. He
is made up of all evil in the world!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Cheery thought.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Whatever the hell it is… It went to sleep
for the night. Which is what we should do.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Couldn’t sleep. The heat. I’m in the mood for
passion.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m in the mood for isolation.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m not leaving. Not till I get a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Betsy…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: One kiss. Or I’ll scream. I swear. I’ll wake
the whole boat.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: OKay. Just one. Keep your mouth closed.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What’s that you’re writing?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: “The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana Jones,
Professor Of Perversity”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You are blowing this Betsy thing all out of
proportion…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s not as if I have this sleazy
reputation…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I am a respected…honored… admired…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: C’mon… You ain’t so tough. You wouldn’t last
ten minutes in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Scraggy!… No!… Keep goin’ straight!… Full
steam ahead!…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: What?… You crazy Indy?… We be crushed!… We
smash into rock wall!…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No!… Trust me!… Full steam ahead!… Full
steam ahead !…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Free the girl… …and my friends… …or I blow
your hideout here out of the water!</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Good. We will all die.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We can take you to the Lost City of Sun Wu
Kung!</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Hah! Better men than you have tried to find
the Lost City… They have all failed. You are a fool.</p>
<p>****: No… You’re the fool. You and your friends are hiding out in Sun
Wu Kung’s Water Curtain Cave…and you don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Huh?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t bother. Only WE can translate it.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: The Lost City… Said to have streets paved in
gold…treasures far greater than any mortal man could imagine…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Your pathetic lives will be spared. For now.
But everything we find in the Lost City…belongs to ME.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Fat chance, Sinbad. It’s 50-50. Or you’ve
got no deal.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: It is my way. Or you’ve got no head.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Read that last proverb again…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: “High tide drowns curiosity, Low tide
quenches thirst”.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There’s something here…something that could
help us…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Look at ’em. It’s like they’ve never seen a
woman before.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: To them… We’re the ultimate women.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Kinda’ flattering, isn’t it?… Being the girl
of 200 guy’s dreams?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Is there an area… A place where the tide
changes?…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: In a few hours…the water will be lower…much
lower…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: And the remainder of this wall will be
visible?….</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’re gonna need light. A lot of light. On
this wall.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: To my good fortune.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: You know… We are very much alike, Doctor
jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: We both share a remarkable talent for
killing.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’ve never gotten used to killing, pal. I
do it for survival.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: I do it for pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This is incredible…this map was obviously
used by Sun Wu Kung’s disciples…if they were ever lost…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: These drawings…they are of the surrounding
jungle…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Where is that?…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: It is located at the most South Eastern part
of the jungle…near the mountains… There is a village there. The
Mongooboo Tribe.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You know them?</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Very well. I traded with the chief for many
years.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Good. We’ll leave in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That sound. Again.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Still far away…but getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: The village is there. Beyond the thick of
jungle.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thought you said they knew you?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wait… Listen… They’re not following us…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Be careful where you step… We’ve got to
move slowly…very slowly…</p>
<p><strong>a giant, metal trap, over four feet high, shoots up from the
ground! a</strong>: HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The
trap’s SHARP METAL TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Clare! What are you…?!?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: I imitated the sound of a Lion Mother calling
her babies.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: C’mon. Let’s get outta’ –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Is this the Tribal Chief you told me
about?… Your friend?…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: No. That is him.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: This is a different tribe. New. They have
taken over the village.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What happened to the other tribe?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You recognize their language?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: I tell him we divine messengers of Sun
Wu-Kung. If he interfere with our mission… Jade Emperor come down from
heavens and destroy his village.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: I tell him we lose path to city… I ask if
he have something to help us.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say this will help us. And since we are
divine messengers…we will know how to use it!</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Indy. I’m frightened.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m claustrophobic.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Clare!… Wait!…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: An earthquake?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Wildebeest.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: We have to get out… Or we’ll be crushed to
death.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Scraggy… How close?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Two miles.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Where’s the softest ground?…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad spirits… We
must stay away…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: That’s odd… Wildebeests will not stampede
unless provoked…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: This time, it is very close, Indy. Very
close!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Indy?… Indy?…</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Safest place from bad spirits…is in
branches of tree.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Send help! We need assistance!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Indy in trouble! We must help!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Don’t move. All of you. Stay where you
are.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: It was you. You’re the reason the Nazis found
us.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Nobody move. Or we’ll go over.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Jump!… Jump!…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Call your mommy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This is Jones. I’ve got your tank. It’s all
over, pal. You lose.</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: Doctor Jones… You surprise me. For a
supposedly intelligent man…you jump to childish conclusions. Remember…
You are driving our tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere. You are far from
defeating us, my friend. The battle has only just begun.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’ve got to move. Fast. Ask him if he
knows the way to the City from here.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He do not know exact place… But it is
somewhere over there.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: A lotta’ good that does us… It could take
us months…years…to search everyone of those.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Maybe he knows what to do with this…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: It is “Magical Mirror of Sun Wu Kung”…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: But whattayou do with it?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: “I come from Land Of City On Clouds”.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: This is called “Taskipi”. Only the bravest
play.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’ve been talking to Dr. Clarke about our
problem.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Problem?… Hey… What’re you two doin’
talkin’ behind my back?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Betsy needed help. I obliged.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Since when did you become the female
Sigmund Freud?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Since I received a Masters Degree in
Psychology.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: We play again?</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: The game is not yet over, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: You have lost. You must pay.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: I don’t have money…</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: No. No. money. Rules of the game declare
that I may choose a souvenir. A part of your body. Any part I wish.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Dr. Clarke says that you’re not really in
love with me. You’re just trying to prove that you can still attract
younger women. You’re terrified of getting old.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s what I told her. I told her that you
really did love me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Well…that’s…ah…well…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You mean… She was right?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No… I mean Yes… I mean…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No, Betsy. I don’t love you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: That’s the first time you ever said it!</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: There. There. He’s a very disturbed man.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Your eyes. They are a striking deep
blue.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Enough. We’re in this together. If we start
fighting among ourselves… we’ll never get out alive.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: You owe me, old man.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Doctor Jones!!!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say that two miles ahead…we will find
his home.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: How do I work the big gun?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Want your souvenir? Start with his good
arm.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: W-W-Wait!… Please!…</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: There. That is what you want.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: The tank’s large gun barrel SWIVELS.
Pointing UPWARD. To the ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a
FEW FEET. Then FIRES ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes
through the area.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Tell him to take off my stuff!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He say… “Our Prince has returned home”.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: He thank us…for returning his son.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: If the little guy’s pushin’ 200 years?… How
old’s his Father?</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: His name “Bohbala”. He is Ruler of City,
faithful servant of his Lord and Master… Sun Wu-Kung. He welcome us to
stay. As long as we wish.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Ask him where we may find the burial
place…or the remains…of Sun Wu- Kung…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Bastard…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: It is written… If ruler is defeated by
greater power…he who possess that power… …shall become ruler!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This is turning into one helluva
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbubg</strong>: One you will never awaken from, Doctor
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: I want to see Jones!</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Your friend makes a wonderful
interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: “The Nazi Party will exist for one
thousand years…and I wish to be alive for every year!” That is a
favorite philosophy of our feuher.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Your feuher’s philosphies belong on a
bathroom wall.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: This is a very serious matter, Doctor
Jones. It could save your life. I understand that somewhere in this
City…there is a Garden of… Immortal Peaches?… I want information about
this Garden… And I would greatly appreciate it, if you would share
everything you know, with me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I don’t share anything with Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Very well. My friends will be here soon.
They will rest…enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom… Then we shall
exterminate these worthless people! Destroy their City! And we will
carry away all of its riches…in pieces.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Sir… We shall reach the mountain top in less
than sixty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Doctor Jones… Those beasts are anxious
to run wild. Free. How long will you be able to ride… before they TEAR
YOU IN TWO?</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Goodbye, Doctor Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>gutterbuhg</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nazis’ll be be here soon. We gotta move
fast.</p>
<p><strong>mephisto</strong>: Idiot!… Why are you dressed like that!…
Where is your uniform?…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: They want you to give speech.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What?!?…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Before battle… General always give speech
to inspire troops.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: General?… Who the hell do they think I am…
Custer?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Geez… The only speeches I remember are from
college…when I played ball…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Men…and, ah…women… I…ah… We’re about to
face one of our toughest opponents… They’ve got size…hardware…and well,
quite frankly…we’re the underdogs…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: But…well, if it wasn’t for the little
guy…where would this country be?… I mean…I knew this little guy once …a
scrawny runt, with thick black glasses and about 300 different kinds of
allergies… But this little kid had a dream… He wanted to be on the
football team. Well, all the big guys made his life miserable…always
shoving his head in the drinking fountain…putting mustard in his
pants…throwing me …‘er, HIM!…throwing HIM in the shower with all his
clothes on… But that little guy didn’t quit. Be worked hard. Never gave
up. And in two years…he was the Quarterback. Star of the team. And you
know why?… ’Cause that little kid had somethin’ that those big guys
never heard of… He had HEART! And nothin’ can stop that! Nothin’! Now
let’s go out there and show ’em</p>
<p><strong>pans away, several feet ahead of the tank. camera moves
upward, to the</strong>: MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A
GROUP OF GORILLAS are beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of
individual sections of HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE
RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands
with ANOTHER GROUP OF GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of
vine.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Do exactly what I do.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: I made the sound of a baby Swandola bird,
crying for help… The Mother birds immediately reply to the cries
…angrily protecting their children, and murdering the baby’s
attackers.</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: You owe me, old man.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: He’s…dead…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But… It’s… It’s the middle of the night…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Sun always shine in the Garden of Immortal
Peaches.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: These are the peaches that make one …forever
young?…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: What does it say?…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: “Our Lord… Our Master… Sun… Wu… Kung”</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Damn you, Jones! Why couldn’t you be here to
share this with me!</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: We cannot bury these men!… This is a
garden of life… Not of death!…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Why’s he speakin’ in English?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: He is a heavenly being. According to legend,
when a heavenly being speaks, men of all countries can understand him.
We hear him in English…the pygmies hear him in their language.</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: Return their souls!… I demand it!…
Return their souls!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What the hell’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: I think there is someone you should meet…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You… You’re… Sun Wu Kung?…</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: You are… Indiana Jones?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Huh?… You know me?</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: I have watched you for many, many
years…from the heavens. I was fascinated by your bravery…your passion…in
searching for me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Well, I… Thanks I’m very honored.</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You
and your friends have saved my city from ruin. I would like to return
the favor.</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
faithful friend. It is capable of one hundred transformations…and will
always remain by your side.</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: I will explore the heavens for another.
Surely, my search will be shorter and less hazardous than yours!</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: With my city alive again…I will be able
to return to the heavens. Goodbye…my dear friends.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: She is a wonderful treasure… Eh?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We had a deal.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: I have no deals with dead men.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do you
suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness?… It is not
my way of life!</p>
<p><strong>kezure</strong>: Kill them… But save their hair. I will make
a coat out of it.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I thought the peaches promised
immortality…eternal youth?…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The garden of immortal peaches promises
life only to those who are pure in heart. Kezure was evil. His heart was
filled with greed.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Where’s Betsy?… The boat leaves in five
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you
something for your journey!</p>
<p><strong>scraggy</strong>: Take one drink before bed. It keep out all
bad spirits.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thanks, Scraggy…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Indy!…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Where’re your bags?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Huh?… But, you… You have to finish
school.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I’m staying on as Clare’s assistant.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: But you’re MY assistant.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Not any more. I’m having my credits
transfered.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Why?…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Clare is a brilliant teacher.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Yes, but I don’t offer a course in
seduction.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Indy… I thought you wanted me out of your
life…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That was before I realized how gifted…how
talented you are… I mean… I could really use you…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Especially aboard ship for three weeks. It
gets terribly lonely.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I warned you…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Indy, I’ve learned a lot from you. But it’s
time I started concentrating on a career in anthropology…instead of
romance.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’ve certainly developed a mature
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Thanks to you. You know… I always thought of
you as my knight in shining armor…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: But now, I’ll think of you as the Father I
never had.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Doctor Jones…although your libido is
questionable, your bravery and intelligence are exceptional. It has been
an honor working with you.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Why… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You know, Clare…there’s something…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: …something I’ve been wanting to do…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: …since we first met…</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Sorry. Guess I left her cage open… she
followed us.</p>
<p><strong>sun wu kung</strong>: The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
faithful friend. It is capable of one hundred transformations…and will
always remain by your side.</p>
