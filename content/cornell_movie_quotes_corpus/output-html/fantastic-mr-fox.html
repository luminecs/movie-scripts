<h1 id="fantastic-mr-fox">fantastic-mr-fox</h1>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’d the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Nothing. Supposedly, it’s just a twenty-
four hour bug. He gave me some pills.</p>
<p>****: I told you. You probably just ate some bad gristle. Fox brushes
the fur on Mrs. Fox’s ears with his paws. They walk together along the
crest of the hill to a fork in the path. Fox points:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Should we take the short cut or the scenic
route?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Let’s take the short cut.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But the scenic route is so much prettier.</p>
<p>****: OK, let’s take the scenic route.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Great. It’s actually slightly quicker, anyway.
Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a quick
circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her waist extravagantly
and making her laugh as they start off down the scenic route.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: What is a squab?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You know what a squab is. It’s like a pigeon, I
suppose. Anyway, it’s a type of bird we can eat. Fox motions toward the
edge of the property.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Should we go through the hole under the horse
fence or climb the rail over the bridle path?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
little safer.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But the bridle path puts us out right next to
the squab shack. Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s wrong? I’ve never seen you like this.
You’re acting all skittish. Don’t worry. I’ve been stealing birds for a
living since before I could trot.</p>
<p>****: OK, let’s take the –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No, we’ll do the horse fence. You gave me the
scenic route already. Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: By the way, you look unbelievably beautiful
tonight. You’re practically glowing. Maybe it’s the lighting.</p>
<p>****: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this With the
speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and Mrs. Fox: dart through
a hole under a painted fence; race along a thin trail next to a garage;
crawl beneath a window where a blonde woman serves an early dinner,
dealing hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond children;
creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever sleeps with an airline
sleeping mask over his eyes; and shimmy over a doorway outside a
workshop where a blond, bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a
hatchet, completely pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of
a wooden shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
rapid reverse-flip with a flourish. Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to
Mrs. Fox and puts his finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
impatiently. They duck inside. They come back out. Each holds a dead,
bloody pigeon in his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up
above them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his mouth
and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s that? I think that’s a fox-trap! Look at
this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Get away from there.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Is it spring-loaded? Yeah… I guess if you come
from over there, and you’re standing at the door to the squab shack,
this little gadget probably triggers the – Move out of the way, darling.
That’s right where it’s going to land. Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and
tugs at his arm.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Come on! Stop it! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No, it just falls straight down right here,
doesn’t it? I guess it’s not spring- loaded. Sounds come from around the
farm: the dog barks, doors open, voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox
turns to Fox and says</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I’m pregnant. Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He
is confused but moved.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Wow. We’re going to have a cub. Honey, that’s
great news!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: If we’re still alive tomorrow morning, I
want you to find another line of work. Pause. Fox nods.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A wide shot of the entire valley. There are
thick woods, green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
river running through the middle.</p>
<p><strong>title:</strong>: 2 YEARS LATER</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: A column in the newspaper with Fox’s
picture at the top of it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with
Fantastic Mr. Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Does anybody actually read my column? Do your
friends ever talk about it?</p>
<p>****: Of course. In fact, Rabbit’s ex- girlfriend just said to me
last week, “I should read Foxy’s column,” but they don’t get the
Gazette. Ash! Let’s get cracking!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why would they? It’s a rag-sheet.</p>
<p>****: I want to say I hate my job, but that would make it seem more
important to me than I want people to think it is. Mrs. Fox puts down
her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of bread. A small, narrow fox cub
comes out of one of the bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His
hair is smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m sick.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You’re not sick.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I have a temperature. Mrs. Fox goes quickly
over to Ash and puts her paw to his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You don’t have a temperature. Ash turns
away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I don’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Hurry up. You’re going to be late.
Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast and coffee.
Fox whispers to her:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I love the way you handled that. Mrs. Fox looks
at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Your cousin Kristofferson’s coming first
thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be extra nice to him, because he’s
going through a very hard time right now, OK? Ash comes back out of his
bedroom. He now wears a white cardigan and white socks with his white
pants tucked into them. He says aggressively:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Where’s he going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: We’re going to make a bed for him in your
room tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I can’t spare the space. Put him in Dad’s
study. Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Dad’s study is occupied by Dad. Ash goes back
into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He looks around the room. He
says to Mrs. Fox:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I don’t want to live in a hole anymore. It
makes me feel poor. Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox
and says</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: We are poor – but we’re happy. Fox twists
his paw in the air, indicating:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
better above ground. Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and
a cup of coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m seven non-fox-years old now. My father died
at seven and a half. I don’t want to live in a hole anymore, and I’m
going to do something about it. Fox kisses Mrs. Fox’s paw. He suddenly
eats three slices of toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly.
He stands and picks up his cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well, I’m off. Fox throws back the last of his
coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase,
tucks his newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Have a good day, my darlings! Ash comes out the
bedroom again. He has now added a white cape to his ensemble and is in
the middle of brushing his teeth. There is toothpaste all over his
mouth. He waves briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s he wearing? Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles
sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves back. He starts to go out but pauses
to look down at a folded up section of his newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: A clipping from the real estate section.
There is a photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
hill. A caption below it reads: Tree Living, Great Views, Classic
Beech</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Obviously, it’s first growth, indigenous.
Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping stone hearth – Weasel is
interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox peer into the next room.
A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick tinkers with some pipes under the
kitchen sink. He is Kylie. Weasel snaps at him:</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: What’d I tell you? I’m showing the property.
You’re not supposed to be here.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Oh, cuss. What time is it? I’m sorry. Weasel
sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie’s direction and says distractedly,
slightly annoyed:</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: This is Kylie. He’s the super. He’s a little
– Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He points at
a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts, tools, and washers.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?</p>
<p>****: Just minnows. You want one?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Certainly. Thank you. Kylie reaches into his
bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry compounds in the
distance. Black smoke pours out of a farmhouse chimney on each property.
A sign on a water tower in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has
a picture of a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A sign on a
windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: May I ask what you do for a living, Mr. Fox?
Fox’s eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth slightly
open. He says almost inaudibly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I used to steal birds, but now I’m a newspaper
man.</p>
<p>****: Oh, sure. I’ve seen your by-line. Fox snaps out of his reverie
and says suddenly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Fox shakes hands
abruptly with Weasel and starts across the room. Weasel is about to ask
something when Fox stops in the doorway, looks back, and says:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh, and Kylie – thank you for the minnow. It
was superb. Kylie smiles. Fox exits.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Don’t buy this tree, Foxy. You’re borrowing
at nine and a half, which stinks like cuss, plus moving into the most
dangerous neighborhood in the</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: country for someone of your type of
species.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re exaggerating, Badger.</p>
<p>****: Bull-cuss! I’m sugar-coating it, man! This is Boggis, Bunce,
and Bean! Three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in the history
of this valley! An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the
outer office. Fox looks intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Really? Tell me about them. Silence. Badger
sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a
tweed suit which stretches at the buttons so much that they look like
they are about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in front
of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken houses. He has an
ugly face. He is Boggis.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer. Probably
the most successful in the world.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: He’s unbelievably fat – which maybe is
genetic – but he also eats three boiled chickens smothered with
dumplings every day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and dessert. That’s
twelve in total, per diem.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: He never takes a bath, as a result of which
his ear holes are clogged with all kinds of muck and wax and bits of
chewing gum and dead flies and so on.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A short, overweight man with one slightly
wandering eye. He wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge
shotgun. He stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is Bunce.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer. He
owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000 geese. You might say he’s kind ofa
pot- bellied dwarf of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: He’s so short his chin would probably be
under water in the shallow end of any swimming pool on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up goose
livers injected into them.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat.
He holds a Luger pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an
apple orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean
face. He is Bean.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Franklin Bean is a turkey and apple farmer.
He keeps his birds in an orchard</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: He’s probably anorexic, because he never
eats anything. He’s on a liquid diet of strong, alcoholic cider, which
he makes from his apples. He’s as skinny as a pencil, as smart as a whip
– and easily the biggest cusshole I’ve ever met in my life.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and Badger in Badger’s office.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: In summation, I think you just got to not do
it, man. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I understand what you’re saying, and your
comments are valuable, but I’m going to ignore your advice. Badger leaps
out of his chair and slams the office door. He points his finger at Fox
and screams:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: The cuss you are!</p>
<p>****: The cuss am I? Fox jumps up and points back at Badger,
screaming:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Don’t cussing point at me!</p>
<p>****: Are you cussing with me?</p>
<p>****: Do I look like I’m cussing with you? Fox and Badger begin to
snarl and snap savagely, knocking into the furniture as they circle
around the room pointing in each other’s faces. Suddenly, they calm down
all at once, sighing deeply. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: One last thing: something’s probably about to
happen to me at work which I can’t put my finger on but have a funny
feeling about. How can I protect myself legally?</p>
<p>****: Are you about to get fired?</p>
<p>****: Slash quit.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A door with a frosted glass window. Letters
painted on it read Gazette, Editor-in-Chief, Phillip Squirrel. Fox’s
silhouette stands across from that of a small squirrel sitting at a
desk. The squirrel’s silhouette says in a</p>
<p><strong>squirrel</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Slash I quit. Here’s my letter of resignation.
Fox’s silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>montage:</strong>: Two muskrats in orange moving company
uniforms unloads boxes and furniture from a wagon and carries them into
the tree. Fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them. Two
muskrats in white painter’s uniforms paints the walls of the living room
and the trim around the windows with rollers and brushes. Fox stands on
the drop-cloth and barks orders at them.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: A binocular shot of an industrial shack
with Boggis Chicken House #1 stencilled on the front of it. Fox lowers
the binoculars. His eyes sparkle.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Watch this, Dad! Fox looks up. Ash leaps into
the air and does a spectacularly awkward back-flip during which he
appears to have four arms and three legs randomly attached to his body,
flailing wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces. He claps
mildly.</p>
<p>****: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three legs
randomly attached to his body will be used for this</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your tail
tucked! Fox looks at Mrs. Fox’s canvas. It is a picture of the pond and
landscape in severe weather with black clouds and lightning bolts. It is
signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Still painting thunderstorms, I see. Fox sees a
small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a pair of yellow
sneakers. He frowns.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Whose suitcase is that? A boy’s voice shouts
from the high tree branch:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Hello, everyone! Good afternoon! Fox,
Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub stands poised on
the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner, sleeker, and it is
immediately apparent even by his posture infinitely more graceful than
Ash. He is Kristofferson. He wears a professional Speedo with a patch on
it that says Swim Team. Fox brightens.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kristofferson! Welcome to our little tree! I
see you brought your swimming trunks! Kristofferson steps off the branch
and performs a reserved but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water
splashlessly. Fox leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his
head, whistling and hollering:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Look at that! This kid’s a natural! I’m
speechless, Kristofferson! Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash
stares at him stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Plus, he knows karate.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Do you think I’m an athlete?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Well, you know, I think I’m an athlete, and
sometimes I feel like you guys don’t see me that way.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s the sub-text here? Ash thinks for a
minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the next room. Kristofferson is now
sitting Indian-style on the floor meditating. His paws are turned upward
with his thumbs touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says
loudly to Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: How long is Kristofferson supposed to stay with
us?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Until your uncle gets better.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Right, but roughly how long do we plan to give
him on that? Double-pneumonia isn’t even really that big of a deal, is
it? In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the doorway and
whispers forcefully:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: As a matter of fact, it is. He’s lucky to
be alive. Now –</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Right, but – Kristofferson yells suddenly as he
does a spinning double- kick with a chop:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Ki-ya! Everyone looks startled.
Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon- do practice with an angry, wounded
look on his face. Mrs. Fox</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Lower your voice, Ash.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kids are crazy, aren’t they? You got to try it,
though. Raising a family.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What do you think of this tree, by the way?
It’s great, huh?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I have one last part of what I was about to
say.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: OK. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m going broke. You want to help me steal some
chickens?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox’s study, the next morning. A map of the
valley with notes and arrows written all over it is spread across a
desk. The door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie sits in a
creaky rocking chair.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I used to do this professionally, and I was
very successful at it. I had to get out of it for personal reasons, but
I’ve decided to secretly quit my job slash got fired to pursue it again.
I’m bringing you in as my secretary and personal assistant.</p>
<p>****: This is actually kind of a big deal, so don’t just say,
“OK!”</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: OK. Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m going totape this formyrecords,so don’t
make a lot of sounds –meaning stop rocking.</p>
<p>****: Well, maybe we ought to turn off the radio, then. That’s
noisier than –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I don’t want people to eavesdrop on us, Kylie.
Let me just tell this. Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape
recorder.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: That night. Fox stands on a rock at the
edge of the woods looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and
gives a hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap. Kylie has on a
navy ski-hat.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’ll start with Boggis’ Chicken House #1. His
only security is a few old hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now a
word about beagles: never look a beagle directly in the eye. And if
–</p>
<p>****: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Beagles aren’t so tough.</p>
<p>****: Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these beagles has chronic
rabies, which he’s on medication for, and if you get bit by him you have
to get shots in your stomach for six months. And, second – listen, I’m
not going to justify this to you. Just pay attention and stop
interrupting me. I’m taping this.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I picked some blueberries, butterflied them
with a scalpel, and laced each one with ten milligrams of high-potency
sleeping powder.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: Fox’s paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered
mickey into a dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red
thread.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and Kylie in Fox’s study earlier that
afternoon. They now smoke pipes.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: How do we make them eat it?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Beagles love blueberries.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: If we approach with the wind in our faces,
we’ll smell the chicken livers on Boggis’ breath from at least fifty
yards away.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Remember: they aren’t very smart, but they’re
incredibly paranoid – so always kill a chicken in one bite.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and Kylie in Fox’s study earlier that
afternoon. They now drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: One bite, get it? Fox waits for Kylie to
respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Are you listening to me? I look into your eyes
and I can’t tell whether you’re getting anything I’m saying. Kylie
stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.</p>
<p>****: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A few beagles, as we discussed, but we’re ready
for that. Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You feel that? The wind’s in our faces.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Yeah, back in the old days, didn’t they used
to do a thing where if somebody saw a wolf, and –</p>
<p>****: What wolf? Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie
looks at him curiously.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh, nothing? Never mind. Fox and Kylie veer off
into shorter grasses. Fox points ahead, regaining his composure:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Here comes the low stone wall. Not a problem.
Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves at the
base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did I not
remember this? Maybe it’s new. Let’s pause.</p>
<p>****: What the cuss? Where’d this giant fence come from? We had a
master plan! Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
the fence.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What’s this lightning bolt stand for?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Give me a second! I said, “Let’s pause”! Pause.
Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the plywood lightning
bolt.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean maybe
this fence might be electric.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Well, I just hope it doesn’t mean thunder. I
have a phobia of that. Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end
of one of its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
blueberries with white thread stitched into them.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Watch this. Fox puts a blueberry into the end
of a straw and shoots it out into the barnyard.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The blueberry landing on the ground in
front of Chicken House #1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He
eats it. He looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox with an ecstatic expression on his
face. He rapidly shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard.
Beagles eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and Kylie
drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House #1. Fox whispers
excitedly as they run:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Beagles love blueberries! Didn’t I tell you?
The master plan’s working again! Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically
and trips over an unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and
they weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance to the
chicken house, open the door, and duck inside. Pause. There is an
eruption of crazed squawking, screaming, and fighting from inside. The
chicken house rumbles. Lights jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes
off. Voices yell. The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and
Kylie emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead chickens,
and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I said one bite, cuss it!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: I’m trying! I have a different kind of teeth
from you! I’m an opossum!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: That’s so grisly! There’s blood and
everything!</p>
<p>****: We’re killing chickens! There’s going to be blood in this
story! Follow me! Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in
front of it. Kylie looks to Fox.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What’s the master escape plan? Fox hesitates,
confused. A gunshot fires from among the chicken houses. Fox shouts to
Kylie:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Follow me again! Fox and Kylie run back across
the barnyard, past the beagles as they begin to wake up and stagger
around. Farmhands appear, loading shotguns and running into the
confusion. Fox and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into
the house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in the
kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the darkness. Kylie
shakes his head in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Wow. That was amazing. How did we do that? We
ran the other way or something.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I have no idea. Fox opens the door-flap a
crack. He looks out and sees Boggis opening the front gate to let out
his beagles and farmhands, barking and shooting, as they search for the
intruders. Fox shouts to Kylie:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow me
again! Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door- flap,
race across the barnyard, and dart through the open gate. Up the road,
Boggis screams furiously as he runs with his pack of beagles and
farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the bushes. As they race through the
underbrush Fox says</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Let’s hit the five and dime on the way home! We
need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop! Fox and Kylie howl
ecstatically.</p>
<p><strong>montage:</strong>: A fox’s paw lifts a silver dome off a
perfectly roasted chicken with an apple in its mouth. Fox and Mrs. Fox
sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and drinking wine. Ash,
Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a slightly miniature table eating
chicken and drinking milk. Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife
a story. Wine comes out of his nose. Fox and Kylie dash out the door of
Boggis’ Chicken House #7 carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt
on. Farmhands run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a
hole cut into the electric fence. Fox and Kylie dash out the window of
Bunce’s Poultry Barn C carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring.
Farmhands run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
knocked into a brick wall. Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean’s
Apple Orchard XII carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples.
Automatic doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade. Fox and Kylie
run full-speed through a clover field in the dark. The camera zooms in
slowly on their faces as they ford a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and
cross into the willow glade. They look exhilarated.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Where’d you get this chicken?</p>
<p>****: I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last night on my way back
from –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: It’s got a Boggis Farms tag around its
ankle.</p>
<p>****: Huh. Must’ve escaped from there before I bought it.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won for
being an athlete. Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults’ table. Fox guzzles
down a last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m supposed to cover this book party at some
animal’s nest in a tobacco field down the hill, so me and Kylie are
going to hop over there and give it a whirl. Don’t wait up. Fox pulls
his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the table, and stands up.
Mrs. Fox asks cooly:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: What’s the book?</p>
<p>****: Some memoir. I’ll get him to sign you a copy. Fox kisses
Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Dinner was – – pitch-perfect.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
underneath the back door to Bean’s secret cider cellar.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: We’re breaking into Bean’s house?</p>
<p>****: Cellar.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Where he lives?</p>
<p>****: Where he keeps the cider.</p>
<p>****: Below where he lives. Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit,
is walking with Fox and Kylie. Fox stops short:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Where’d you come from? Go back to the tree and
do your homework!</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I want to help you steal some cider.</p>
<p>****: We’re going to a book party! And keep your mouth shut about any
cider, because no one ever said that! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: But Dad –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But nothing! You’re going to get me in a lot of
trouble! The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points to
his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can you
believe that? How’d he get tipped off? You think he’s going to tell on
us? Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Before we go any further, from now on can you
give me some kind of signal once in a while just so I know any of this
is getting through to you? Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his
paw. Fox hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Was that it? OK.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: One time this wolf –</p>
<p>****: What’s with all the wolf talk? Can we give it a rest, for once?
Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window shutter. He and
Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar bars.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Look at all this apple juice.</p>
<p>****: Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn’t come here for apple juice.
This is some of the strongest, finest alcoholic cider money can buy – or
that can even be stolen. It burns in your throat, boils in your stomach,
and tastes almost exactly like pure, melted gold.</p>
<p>****: Let’s crack open one these ’shine jars and do a shooter. A
match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around the room
frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from behind a huge jar,
they see an enormous rat in a striped shirt with a lit match in his
claw. He puts the flame in his mouth to snuff it out and holds the
matchstick in his teeth. He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a
small pot-belly. He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik. He
takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck of his cider
jar. He says with a slightly sinister New</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Y’all are trespassin’, now. Illegally. ’Round
these parts, we don’t take kindly to cider poachers. Fox and Rat stare
at each other. Fox says, finally:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’ve aged badly, Rat.</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: You’re gettin’ a little long in the tooth,
yourself, partner. Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a
shelf, down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at Fox’s
feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it. He hisses.</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: How’s your old lady doin’? Kylie peers out from
his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and Rat circle each other
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Do you refer to my wife?</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: She was the town tart, in her day. Wild and
foot-loose and pretty as a mink stole. She was a creme brulee – until
you made an honest woman out of her, Mr. Fox. Kylie says, intrigued,
from his hole:</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p>****: Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she lived. We all did. It
was a different time. Let’s not use a double-standard. She marched
against the –</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: But town tart?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shut up. Rat lunges at Fox with his
switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He cocks an eyebrow and smiles:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That was close, Rat. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Oh, I’m as careful as a – A door at the top of
the stairs opens suddenly with a loud creak. Rat and Fox look terrified.
They both dart away and hide behind cider jars. A heavy-set, middle-aged
housekeeper carrying a rolling pin comes down the stairs and walks
straight over to the shelf where Fox is hiding.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: How many jars should I bring up, ma’am?
A strong, almost masculine woman’s voice answers from</p>
<p><strong>masculine voice</strong>: I don’t know. Two, I guess. The
housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one Fox is hiding
behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses his body. He shivers
slightly. A graze of the red fur of his arm sticks out barely from
behind his jar. The housekeeper hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: He drank three yesterday, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>masculine voice</strong>: All right, take three. The
housekeeper grabs Fox’s jar. Fox closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>masculine voice</strong>: No, don’t. The housekeeper stops
with her hand on the neck of Fox’s jar.</p>
<p><strong>masculine voice</strong>: Three’s too many. It’s unhealthy.
He’s anorexic. Bring two. The housekeeper lets go of Fox’s jar. Fox
relaxes slightly. The housekeeper grabs Fox’s jar again. Fox tenses
up.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: But maybe, just in case –</p>
<p><strong>masculine voice</strong>: Two’s plenty. The housekeeper lets
go of Fox’s jar and walks away. She goes back up the stairs and closes
the door. Kylie says in the</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Oh, my cuss. That was like a scene out of</p>
<p><strong>a –</strong>: The door opens again. An exceptionally tall,
powerfully built woman in a black dress and Wellingtons, with grey hair
pulled- back in a bun, bright green eyes, and a meat cleaver tucked
under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs. She</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bean</strong>: To whom it may concern: if I catch a rat
in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean’s secret cider without his express
permission, I intend to chop said rat’s head off, brine it, pickle it,
and bake it in a vermin casserole. I hope this clarifies my position on
the matter. Sincerely, Evelyn Bean. Mrs. Bean turns and goes back up the
stairs. She closes the door. Pause. Rat’s voice says from the
shadows:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Dear Mrs. Bean, your language, while somewhat
purple, is nevertheless impossible to misinterpret. However – comma –
given the proximity of said rat at the moment of your – The door at the
top the stairs opens again. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and Kylie running away from Bean’s
farmhouse with two jars of cider. They both look badly shaken. A gunshot
rings out taking us to:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: I’m going to give a speech, and at the end of
it – I’m going to throw a twist into this plot. Bean lights a cigarette
and begins to walk slowly around the porch.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: First truth: this is the most ambitious fox
we’ve ever encountered, bar none. Bean spins around and shoots out a
second light bulb. Boggis and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
defined in the dictionary. Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third
light bulb.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Third truth: the weakness of the ambitious man
is his Achilles heel – Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs
behind his back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two colleague’s
faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: – but I’ve already figured out where this fox
lives, and tomorrow night we’re going to camp in the bushes, wait for
him to come out of the hole in his tree, and shoot the cuss to
smithereens. How’s that grab you, fellas? Boggis and Bunce hesitate.
They nod and murmur their approval.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Another book party? Fox and Kylie turn
around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool in the darkened pantry.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Woah! I didn’t see you. Sitting in the dark
over there. Yeah, no. Actually, there’s a fire. I just got the call.
They said maybe it’s arson? I got to interview the marshall and see
what’s –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Kylie, is he telling the truth?</p>
<p>****: I don’t want to be put in the middle of this.</p>
<p>****: Thanks, Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: If what I think is happening is</p>
<p>****: – it better not be.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in
the bushes. Bean licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction
of the wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
Boggis and Bunce.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Nice job covering for me. Next time</p>
<p><strong>try –</strong>: A twig snaps. Fox freezes.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the
bushes.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The branches of the trees as the wind
suddenly changes its direction.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the
air three times in a row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says,
panicking:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All three! Fox and Kylie spin around and dart
back into the hole as Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the
bushes. A barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
Silence.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: We got the tail, but we missed the fox. Pause.
Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Petey? You and the boys sober up and get out
here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds
of ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: It’ll grow back, won’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Tails don’t grow back, except for
lizards.</p>
<p>****: Tails don’t grow back. I’m going to be tail-less for the rest
of my life.</p>
<p>****: Well, anyway, it’s not half as bad as double-pneumonia, right?
His dad’s got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel.
That’s a lot worse than – Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto
the floor. It ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
silent. Kristofferson turns away.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Excuse me, everyone. I’m going to go
meditate for half an hour. Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox
looks at Ash and says angrily:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You’ve got twenty-nine minutes to come up
with a proper apology. Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and
stares straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s with the crazy outfit? Why a cape and
the pants tucked into your socks? Ash does not respond. Fox sighs.
Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and
stands with his back to the room.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I got fired slash quit the Gazette and started
stealing chickens on the sly.</p>
<p>****: That tail was the first thing I ever noticed about you. It was
easily the most attractive tail for at least 50 miles in every
direction. It was probably your single best quality – and now it’s gone
forever.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in
the dark next to Mrs. Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why the cuss didn’t I listen my lawyer? At this
point we’ll be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what we’ve
already sunk into it. Fox flips over onto his stomach.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I won’t be able to sleep on my back for six
weeks – and on my stomach I feel congested. Why the cuss didn’t I listen
to my lawyer?</p>
<p>****: Because you don’t listen to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p>****: What? I said – There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox
jumps out of bed. He hollers:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Wake up! Everybody! They’re digging us out!
There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox looks at
Fox intensely:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: They’ll kill the children!</p>
<p>****: Over my dead body, they will.</p>
<p>****: That’s what I’m saying! You’d be dead, too, in that
scenario!</p>
<p>****: Well, I’m arguing against that!</p>
<p>****: What are you talking about?</p>
<p>****: Why are you yelling at me?</p>
<p>****: Stop! Stop! Stop! Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie
standing in the doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders.
Ash</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: You say one thing, she says another, and it
all changes back again! The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling.
Everyone looks up and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the
room with a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
two chairs.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve got it! There’s not a moment to lose! Why
didn’t I think of this before?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Think of what?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Think of the one thing a fox does quicker than
a man, quicker than any other animal in the world!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies
everywhere. The shot booms down into the ground, among the roots of the
tree, through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean mineral
deposits.</p>
<p><strong>1 hour later</strong>: The shot stops at the bottom of a dark
hole deep, deep underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing
heavily, with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied around his
waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat. Everyone looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I think it’s time for me to give us a pep talk
and explain some things. A very long time ago –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: May I have a word with you privately?</p>
<p>****: Well, we’re in a hole. Where –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Just on the other side of this mineral
deposit. Follow me. Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in
the bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz walls.
She wheels on Fox:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I’m going to lose my temper now.</p>
<p>****: When?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p>****: Well, when – Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a
quick sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p>****: Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise
to me while we were caged inside that fox- trap that, if we survived,
you would never steal another chicken, goose, turkey, duck, or squab,
whatever they are. I believed you. Why did you lie to me?</p>
<p>****: Because I’m a wild animal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You’re also a husband and a father.</p>
<p>****: I’m trying to tell you the truth about myself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I don’t care about the truth about
yourself. Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain his
emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: This story is too predictable.</p>
<p>****: Predictable? Really? What happens in the end?</p>
<p>****: In the end, we all die – unless you change. Mrs. Fox walks out
of the air-pocket. Fox stands alone in silence.</p>
<p><strong>bunce</strong>: These foxes dig like a bunch of hyperactive
gophers.</p>
<p><strong>boggis</strong>: Franklin? You got another twist for this
plot?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>boggis</strong>: I say you got another – Bean whips out his
walkie-talkie and twirls it like a six- shooter. He presses a button on
it and says:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Petey? Get me the current contact info for
Earl Malloy on the A.S.A.P.</p>
<p>****: Who’s Earl Malloy?</p>
<p>****: What? You mean over at Malloy Consolidated? Oh, he does
rentals.</p>
<p>****: What does he rent?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal
bulldozer digging- tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the
sides of them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
spit black grease and smoke. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the
tractors nodding giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers’
seats and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a dictionary to
see over the dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox, Mrs. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and
Kristofferson digging frantically.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth
and tossing them into the meadow. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, drunk with
digging, laugh manically as the controls of their tractors.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Let’s kick some fox cuss!</p>
<p><strong>bunce</strong>: I’m cussing loving this!</p>
<p><strong>boggis</strong>: Who’s hyper-cussing-active now? Bean throws
his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant shovels clank against
each other, ripping through the tree’s roots.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: A temperature gauge with its needle pushing
the limits of the red.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy
yellow and black jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch
on his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging crazily
with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect dancing on his
lenses.</p>
<p><strong>earl malloy</strong>: These machines weren’t made to be
handled like this.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: The hill with half its earth dug out
from under the tree. The tree still stands precariously above the wild
tractors.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: The hill now razed with the fallen,
old beech tree laying on its side as the tractors dig deeper.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: The tractors almost completely below
ground in a deep crater. A crowd of neighbors and local press from the
town has gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble up
out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean climb
down from their tractors. They look angry and tired. They stand among
the workers and onlookers. A television reporter with an Action 13
camera crew confronts</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Farmer, correct me if I’m misreading the
data, you’ve successfully destroyed the scenery, but the alleged fox
remains at large. What will you three prominent farmers do now?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Well, Dan, I can tell you what we’re not going
to do. We’re not going to let him go.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Are you concerned about the
possibility</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: I have no further dialogue in this scene. Bean
turns away from the reporter and pulls Boggis and Bunce aside. He
addresses them with calm intensity:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: I’m not going home until we smoke this
son-of-a-cuss out his hole, string him up on a clothesline, and fly him
like a kite. Boggis, how many men have you got working on your farm?</p>
<p><strong>boggis</strong>: Thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Bunce?</p>
<p><strong>bunce</strong>: Thirty-six.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: And I’ve got thirty-seven. That’s 108 men
altogether. Now what do I got here? Two quitters – or are you staying
with?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: That night. A helicopter with a Bean, inc.
decal on the side of it circles the crater scanning the dark terrain
with a searchlight. There are tents, trucks, and 108 men gathered around
the perimeter. They sit on bricks and logs and are armed with bats,
pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows and arrows, and hatchets.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: One of those slovenly farmers is probably
wearing my tail as a necktie by now.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: You’re paranoid, Foxy.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Mrs. Bean sitting in her kitchen watching
television next to an extremely skinny, freckled twelve year-old boy.
The boy points at the screen and laughs to himself:</p>
<p><strong>freckled boy</strong>: Look at Dad’s tie.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: The television set. Bean is on-screen with
the Action 13 reporter. He wears a fox-fur necktie.</p>
<p><strong>petey</strong>: ‘Bout a handsome little fox Let me sing you
folks a yarn. Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum! ’Twas a splendid
little feller Full of wit ’n’ grace ‘n’ charm. Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo,
google-gum! The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other
farmhands as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
annoyed, whistling, playing a jew’s harp, trying to sing along but not
really knowing the words, etc.</p>
<p><strong>petey</strong>: Like any little critter needin’ Vittels for
his littl’uns, Well, he stole, and he cheated, And he lied to survive.
Doodle-dum, diddle-die, doddle-diddle- doodle-dee! Zippy-zo, zippy-zay,
zippy-zappy- zoopy-zee! Let me take a little tick now To color in the
scene: ’Cross the valley lived three yokels Name of Boggis, Bunce, and
Bean.</p>
<p><strong>petey</strong>: Now these three crazy jackies had our hero on
the run. Shot the tail off the cuss With a fox-shootin’ gun. But that
stylish little fox Was as clever as a whip. Dug as quick as a gopher Who
was a hyper-ack-a-tive. Now those three farmers sit ‘Twhere there’s a
hole ’twas once a hill. Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum! And as
far as I can reckon They’re a-settin’ up there still.</p>
<p>****: Way, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google –</p>
<p>****: What are you singing, Petey? Petey stops short. Everyone turns
quickly and sees Bean standing over them in the darkness with his Luger
in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Petey looks nervous.</p>
<p><strong>petey</strong>: I don’t know. I was just kind of making it up
as I was going along… Petey trails off. Bean shakes his head. He looks
highly irritated.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: That’s just weak song-writing! You wrote a bad
song, Petey! Bean throws his cigarette into the campfire. He storms
away. Petey turns to the other farmhands. Everyone looks
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>title:</strong>: 3 DAYS LATER</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Morning in the farmers’ camp. The cook
flips an egg on a skillet. He puts it on a plate with bacon and hands it
to Petey. Petey asks him:</p>
<p><strong>petey</strong>: How long can a fox go without food or
water?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The exhausted foxes and Kylie underground.
Kylie says</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Well, I can only answer as an opossum, but I
don’t think I can last more than another couple of hours before I get
completely dehydrated and starve to death.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: What’s that? Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny
hole appears in the wall at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of
it – and a bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch,
frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel. The flame on Mrs. Fox’s
lantern flickers once and goes out.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p>****: Not a sound! Silence. There is a sudden, loud scrabbling noise.
A match strikes. Fox touches it to Mrs. Fox’s lantern-wick. The tiny
hole in the wall has become a large one. Badger stands in front of Fox
with his law partner Beaver, Beaver’s overgrown, hulking son, a
medium-sized mole, and a grey field mouse with a bandana tied in a
“do-rag” style around his head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and
Badger erupt at each other, screaming simultaneously:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You scared the cuss out of us!</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: I told you not to buy at nine and a cussing
half!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You don’t just bang into somebody’s cussing
tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Are you cussing yelling at me!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re cussing right I’m cussing yelling!</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: We’re all cussing starving to death because
of you, you mangy, cussing, little cuss! Fox and Badger snarl and
scratch at each other, circling around the hole. They calm down
slightly. Badger continues:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: We’ve been digging in circles for three
days. Half the woods’ve been obliterated. Nobody can get out. Right now
my wife’s huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine with Mrs. Mole,
Mrs. Beaver, Rabbit’s ex- girlfriend, no food, no water, and twenty-
seven hungry, whining, starving, little animal brats. This is a total
cluster- cuss for everybody! Fox looks around the room at the entire
gaunt, dirty, emaciated assembly. Everyone stares at him angrily. He
swallows. The mole says softly.:</p>
<p><strong>mole</strong>: I just want to see a little –</p>
<p>****: – sunshine.</p>
<p>****: But you’re nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes barely even open, on a
good day.</p>
<p>****: I’m sick of your double-talk. We have rights! Beaver’s son
looms over Ash and Kristofferson in a muddy alcove on the side of the
tunnel. He pokes Ash in the chest with the finger of his paw.</p>
<p><strong>beaver’s son</strong>: We don’t like you, and we hate your
dad. You’re too snazzy. You dress like a girl. You’re creative. Now grab
some of that mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow it.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m not going to eat mud!</p>
<p><strong>beaver’s son</strong>: Cuss, yeah, you are. Beaver’s son
grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash’s mouth, and forces his jaws
up and down in a chewing motion. Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson
frowns. He takes off his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet
ferocity:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Don’t do that. Beaver’s son looks to
Kristofferson. He looks down at Kristofferson’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>beaver’s son</strong>: Why’d you take your shoes off?</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: So I don’t break your nose when I
kick it. Kristofferson kicks Beaver’s son in the face, karate chops his
neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the enormous youth over
his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver’s son gets up, crying, and walks
out of the alcove. Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as
Kristofferson puts his shoes back on.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I can fight my own fights. Badger and Fox stand
facing each other at the end of the tunnel. Badger says
aggressively:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Those farmers aren’t going to quit until
they’ve got you and every member of your family nailed upside-down to a
bloody stick with your eyes gorged out.</p>
<p>****: This is getting a little too personal. Badger waits for Fox to
continue. Fox stares into space.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Give me a minute. Fox turns and walks away. He
faces the wall of the tunnel. He sits down on a rock. Everyone watches
him uncertainly. They look at each other. Badger starts to say
something, but Kylie cuts him off sharply:</p>
<p>****: Shh! Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw,
lost in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His paws move
abruptly around in the air drawing lines and shapes. He freezes and
looks straight up at the ceiling of the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of
his paw and looks to the others. He says with a cautious excitement:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p>****: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It could be a good one.</p>
<p>****: Lay it on us.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It might save our lives.</p>
<p>****: Say the idea! Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with
mud still on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All right! Let’s try it!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
Rabbit’s ex-girlfriend, et al. that help is on the way.</p>
<p>****: Is help on the way? Fox grips Mrs. Fox’s paw. He looks into her
eyes and says</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I sure as cuss hope so. Mrs. Fox detects a
special, familiar, inspired light in her husband’s eyes at this moment.
She nods. She hands Ash the lantern. She straightens the neck-line of
his cape, licks the mud off Ash’s snout, and scrambles away down
Badger’s tunnel. Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the
others.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a very
special direction. Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
attentively.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I got to kind of feel out the vibe. Fox stops.
He points slightly downwards and due south. He says with quiet
anticipation:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Begin. Everyone starts digging, slowly but
intently.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The diggers one hundred yards later. Fox
suddenly whistles and raises his fist. The diggers stop digging. Fox
feels the ceiling with his paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds
hollow. He looks at the others with a funny expression and raises an
eyebrow. Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a second
floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve done it! I’ve done it, first time! Come up
and see where you are, my darlings! Everyone scrambles up out of the
tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get how
incredible this is? The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds
up his hands and whispers:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Don’t lose your heads, now. Let’s do this
properly. First, everyone have a drink of water. Fox leads the others
over to the chickens’ drinking trough. They all lap up the cool water.
Fox dries his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>second –</strong>: Fox seizes a black chicken violently.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Ash and Kristofferson running down the
tunnel carrying two dead, black chickens. They turn three corners and
arrive at the mossy hollow. They look inside.</p>
<p><strong>montage:</strong>: Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the
silo in front of Bunce Industries. Cows eat grass in the pasture above.
Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor and dance an
ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the ceiling with plucked
ducks and geese. Smoked hams and sides of bacon dangle from the
rafters.</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: What am I going to do? I’m going to hold him
to the terms of the contract. It’s not my fault they uprooted it.
Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the corner. Ash
goes over to him and holds out a mug.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: They say I owe you an apology for some of the
mean things I said about your father’s illness. His double-pneumonia or
whatever they’re calling it now. Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: So there it is. I hope we can continue our
relationship as cousins or family members or however you want to
define</p>
<p><strong>it –</strong>: – but do me a favor for yourself. The next
time you have a problem with something I’ve said, come to me as a
fox</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: and let’s deal with it right then and not let
it blow up into a whole, huge thing involving parents and so on. Agreed?
Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty mug for a
refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash with his ladle.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: I’m going to teach you karate. Badger
sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: I can imagine how painful, even just
emotionally, that must be for you.</p>
<p>****: Well, you know, it’s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>****: Oh, but, Foxy, how humiliating! Having your whole tail blown
clean off by a –</p>
<p>****: Can we drop it? Kristofferson starts to refill Ash’s mug again.
Ash suddenly puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash
raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean’s famous
nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Who’s got me a donation for the old Wounded
Fireman’s Retirement Pension Fund? Bean pulls a yellow check out of his
inside pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Right here. Let me show you this hole.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all of
you to finally take me up on my offer to have you over to the flint-mine
for dinner, but I guess we have –</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. Maybe my invitation got lost in the mail. Does
anybody know what this badger’s talking about? Everyone laughs. Fox sits
at the opposite end of the table with a crooked smile on his face.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But Clive’s right –</p>
<p>****: – in all seriousness – – excuse me, B. Fox raises his cider
glass. Badger reluctantly sits back down.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I guess we do have those three ugly, cusshole
farmers to thank for one thing: reminding us to be thankful and aware of
each other. I’m going to say it again.</p>
<p>****: Aware. Badger whispers to his wife:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Foxy cuss-blocked my toast, man.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The hole where Fox’s tree once stood. The
dead tree lies on its side. A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the
tunnel. He looks behind him and nods.</p>
<p><strong>fireman #1</strong>: Ready. The shot moves backwards along
the hose, past seven more firemen signalling to each other with: a
thumbs-up, a snap, a fist in the air, a swirl of the fingers, a peace
symbol, an A- OK, and a hook-’em Horns. The shot continues past Boggis,
Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis growls.
Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump on the side of the
fire truck. The chief points:</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Let her rip. A fireman cranks a huge wrench
on a steel nut. A pressure gauge shoots to maximum. The fire truck and
hose begin to vibrate loudly.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a
drain-cover pushed just-open next to a refrigerator. They peer out
across a bright, clean, white kitchen at a plate of perfect, golden
cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step- ladder
directly in front of it. They look at each other. They look around the
quiet, empty room. Ash shrugs. Ash and Kristofferson dart out, leaving
the drain-cover propped-up. They race over the linoleum. They climb the
step- ladder and stop at the plate. Ash swoons and says</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: They’re still warm. Ash and Kristofferson
gather more cookies than they can possibly carry, eating as they collect
them. Crumbs go everywhere. On the other side of the room, the
drain-cover falls shut with a loud clank. Ash and Kristofferson look up,
wildly startled. All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony: the
back door bursting open, a boy and two beagles shouting and barking, the
pantry door slamming, Mrs. Bean and her</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox in mid-toast:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve stepped on some toes and alienated a few
of you over the past few days – but is it wrong for me to suggest we
might’ve done worse than having an incredible banquet in a beautiful
flint-mine surrounded by our favorite animals? Look at each other. Here
we are. Wow. Now I’ve already had too much to drink, and I’m feeling
sentimental, but I’m going to say something, anyway, which nobody wants
to admit, but I think is probably true: we beat ’em. We beat those
farmers, and now we’re triumphantly eating their roasted chicken, their
sizzling duck, their succulent turkey, their foie gras de –</p>
<p>****: Where’d the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson? What am I hearing
again, baby? What’s happening? Am I still paranoid? There is a low,
distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a deafening roar. Everyone
waits, frozen. A single drop of water drips from the ceiling into
Badger’s water glass. Fox turns to Badger and says:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Let’s pause again. A wild deluge smashes into
the room flooding the flint-mine and tunnels with a blasting current
that sweeps everyone and everything away chaotically.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The entire party of well-dressed animals
and their plates, furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel
with the rushing waters. Fox, helpless, holding his breath, looks to the
others underwater: Badger shakes his head in disgust; Rabbit makes a
fierce grimace; Mole bares his teeth ferociously; Beaver rants angrily
with bubbles coming out off his mouth; and Kylie stares ahead vacantly,
holding his nose.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What the cuss just happened? Something with
water. That was dangerous. Is anyone hurt?</p>
<p>****: We’re all hurt! My entire flint-mine just got demolished!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Let’s do a head-count! Everybody pick a buddy!
Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy
relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart about,
searching. He shouts:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Where’d the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson? Ash’s
voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m here. Everyone turns to see Ash standing at
the mouth of a smaller pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox
points to him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Ash! Who’s your buddy?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Kristofferson, but I lost him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You lost him? Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: We went for cookies. Everyone turns to Fox. Fox
yells desperately:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kristofferson! Fox sprints around the cavern,
splashing, digging, and ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join
his frantic search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
Kristofferson!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The three farmers standing next to the fire
truck. Bean holds a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air
by the tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper and
put him in a box with some holes punched in the top.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your brother’s going to kill me, if he survives
his double-pneumonia. Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a
drainpipe,</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: There’s only one way out of this sewer, but
the manhole cover’s closed, and there’s a station-wagon parked on it –
which means we’re permanently stuck down here.</p>
<p>****: You still think we beat ’em, Foxy? Everyone turns to Fox and
stares at him coldly. Fox sits down on the floor, in the water. He says
quietly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Somebody take over. I’m not in charge
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You told me to change, but I can’t –</p>
<p>****: – except, possibly, on some level, I think I just did.</p>
<p>****: Well, then maybe we’re not all going to die. Fox looks to
Mrs. Fox. He stands up suddenly. He takes Mrs. Fox’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Excuse us, everyone. Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to
a ledge near a cement waterfall on the far side of the brick cavern. He
puts his arm around her waist.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Badger’s right. These farmers aren’t going to
quit until they catch me. I shouldn’t have lied to your face. I
shouldn’t have resigned slash gotten fired from the Gazette. I shouldn’t
have pushed these farmers so far and tried to embarrass them and cuss
with their heads. I enjoyed it, but I shouldn’t have done it – and now
there’s only one way out. Maybe if I hand myself over and let them kill
me, stuff me, and hang me over their</p>
<p>****: You’ll do no such thing.</p>
<p>****: Darling, maybe they’ll let everyone else live. Mrs. Fox stares
at Fox. She says desolately:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Why’d you have to get us into this,
Foxy?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I don’t know, but I have a possible theory. I
think I have this thing where I need everybody to think I’m the greatest
– the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox – and if they aren’t completely
knocked- out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by me, then I don’t feel
good about myself. Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox
continues:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Foxes traditionally like to court danger, hunt
prey, and outsmart predators – and that’s what I’m actually good at! I
think, at the end of the day, I’m just –</p>
<p>****: We’re wild animals. Fox smiles sadly and nods. He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I guess we always were. I promise you: if I had
all this to do over again, I’d have never let you down. It was always
more fun when we did it together, anyway. Mrs. Fox has tears all over
her face. Fox kisses her. He whispers in her ear:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I love you, Felicity.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I love you, too, but I shouldn’t have
married you. Mrs. Fox turns and walks away. Fox stares after her. He
goes over to Ash.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Did I ever tell you about the time I learned we
were going to have a cub?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: In the fox-trap.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Right. We were at gun-point, and your</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: – says she’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we were
going to get out of this jam, and then it hit me: what do foxes do
better than any other animal?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Dig.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re stepping on my lines.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Keep telling it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: So we dug. And the whole time I put paw over
paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy
beside me, I kept wondering: who is this little boy going to be?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Or girl.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Or girl, right – because at that point we
didn’t know. Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the
eye.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Ash, I’m so glad he was you. Fox hugs Ash
tightly, holds him for an instant, then let’s go. He turns to the
group.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Badger, organize a search party and try to find
Kristofferson. Maybe he’s alive. I’m sorry, everyone. I wish –</p>
<p>****: Well, good-bye. Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox
standing with her back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are
burning. Fox smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone
watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: I guess we should probably split into a
certain number of groups and start doing something, right?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash,
Mole, and two small rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us? Rat’s
voice echoes in the darkness:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Y’all lookin’ for somethin’? Nothin’ down here
but rusty bottle-caps and drainin’ water. Everyone stops short. Rat
drops into the pipe from an overhead drain ahead of them. He says
ominously:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: They got the boy.</p>
<p>****: Who’s got him?</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: The farmers three. You know who I’m talkin’
about.</p>
<p>****: They’ve kidnapped him?</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Well-done, Mr. Badger. You’re a smart man. They
want to trade the son for his poppa.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Why’d they write this in letters cut out of
magazines?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: To protect their identities. Oh, right, but
then why’d they sign their names? Plus, we already knew who they were
because they’re trying to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: A ransom note written in letters cut out of
magazines and pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:
Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you ever want to see him alive again – Ash
calls out:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m his son. Everyone looks at Ash. He stands
behind them in silhouette. Rat says darkly:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: I can see the resemblance. Pause. In an
instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up off the ground, swings
him in the air, and flings him away twenty feet down the drainpipe.
Badger looks stunned. Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward
him down the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash – he is suddenly jerked
backwards and spun around. Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his
old-fashioned boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch,
nailing Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his
switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest. Fox touches the wound and
looks at the blood on the fingers of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds
up his wrist and shows Fox a child’s plastic digital watch with
miniature footballs, baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says
strangely:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: I’ve still got it.</p>
<p>****: What’d you just say?</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: I said I’ve still got the watch, Mr. Fox. She
never asked for it back. A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps
his jaws onto Rat’s throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to
the ground with his teeth in Rat’s neck. Rat kicks and bucks and
struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox releases him.
Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next to his
father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: The boy’s locked in an apple crate on top of a
gun-locker in the attic of Bean Annex. It’s a set-up.</p>
<p>****: Would you have told me if I didn’t kill you first? Rat smiles
sickly. Blood drips from his mouth. His voice</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All these wasted years. What were you looking
for, Rat? Fox wipes the blood from Rat’s chin. Rat mutters.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: He’s trying to say something, Dad. Fox leans
his ear close to Rat’s mouth. As quiet as a mouse,</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Cider.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean’s finest
secret cider. Rat’s slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a
taste of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:</p>
<p><strong>rat</strong>: Like melted gold. Rat’s eyes turn into X’s. He
is dead. Ash stands up.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: He redeemed himself.</p>
<p>****: Redemption? Sure. Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears
in his eyes:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But, in the end – he’s just another dead rat in
a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant. Ash puts his hand on Fox’s
shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto the sewer floor. He stands up and
turns to the rest of the group. Badger claps his paws together.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Well, I suppose we should –</p>
<p>****: Excuse me, again, B. The search party’s been cancelled. We’re
replacing it with a go-for-broke rescue mission. It’s a set- up, but
maybe we can make it work. You two little rabbits run tell the
others.</p>
<p>****: Now, go! The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe.
Badger walks with Fox and Ash.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: What was he saying about that wristwatch? I
didn’t get what he was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Just some old back-story.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: In a way, I’m almost glad that flood
interrupted us, because I don’t like the toast I was giving. I’m going
to start over. Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: When I look down this table with the exquisite
feast set before us, I see: two terrific lawyers, a skilled
pediatrician, a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate agent, an excellent
tailor, a crack accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty good minnow
fisherman, and possibly the best landscape painter working on the scene
today. As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver;
Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish field mouse;
Mole; Kylie ; and Mrs. Fox, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Maybe a few of you might even read my column
from time to time. Who knows? I tend to doubt it.</p>
<p>****: I also see a room full of wild animals. Everyone stares at Fox
curiously, skeptical but intrigued. Fox points at them:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Wild animals with true natures and pure
talents. Wild animals with scientific- sounding Latin names that mean
something about our D.N.A. Wild animals each with his own strengths and
weaknesses due to his or her species, and also – well, I guess these
things usually have a lot to</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: do with the parents, as we all know. Anyway, I
think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that
just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew
and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy
whatever-it-is. I don’t know. It’s just a thought. Thank you for
listening. Cheers, everyone. Fox motions with his imaginary glass and
pantomimes drinking it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime
drinking. Fox finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the
floor. He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Let’s eat! Everyone turns to Kylie
uncertainly. Kylie hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What? I’m just playing along with the –</p>
<p>****: All right! Let’s start planning! Who knows shorthand? Pause.
Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda. Fox darts over to
her and grips her by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry paper?
Here we go! Fox, highly energized, moves among the group, touching their
shoulders and patting their backs.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Mole! Talpa Europea! What do you got?</p>
<p>****: I can see in the dark?</p>
<p>****: That’s incredible! We can use that! Linda?</p>
<p>****: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Rabbit! Oryctolagus Cuniculus!</p>
<p><strong>rabbit</strong>: I’m fast.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You bet your cuss you are! Linda?</p>
<p>****: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Beaver! Castor Fiber!</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: I can chew through wood.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Amazing! Linda?</p>
<p>****: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Badger! Meles Meles!</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Demolitions expert!</p>
<p>****: What? Since when?</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Explosions, flames, things that burn!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Demolitions expert! OK! Linda!</p>
<p>****: Got it! Fox’s cheeks and forehead are beaded with perspiration.
He</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Weasel! Mustela Nivalis!</p>
<p><strong>weasel</strong>: Stop yelling! Fox snaps his fingers, kicks a
rock, and throws his arm into the air.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All right! Fox points to the various cubs and
pups.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All you little kids get organized and put
together some kind of a K.P. unit or something to keep this sewer clean.
It’s good for morale. The field mouse shoves his way to the front of the
crowd. He makes a fist with his paw.</p>
<p><strong>field mouse</strong>: I want to go with you, too! I want to
fight!</p>
<p>****: Good. Fabulous! Microtus Pennsylvanicus! Do you do that, in
fact? Are field mice violent?</p>
<p><strong>field mouse</strong>: Not particularly, except maybe
domestic/ kitchen sink-type stuff, but I have a hunch I might just –</p>
<p>****: – land a few good punches before I get stepped on, poisoned, or
lured to my death by a little piece of cheese. Who’s to say?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re a cuss of a lot bigger than you look,
Rickity. Kylie tugs at Fox’s sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: I didn’t get a job yet – or a Latin name.
What’s my strength? Fox raises an eyebrow. He thinks of something:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Listen, you’re Kylie. You’re an unbelievably
nice guy. Your job is really just to… be available, I think. I don’t
know your Latin name. I doubt they even had opossums in ancient Rome.
Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It’s stupendous. Where’s us?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Paint an X.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: The bottom of the map. Mrs. Fox’s paw
paints a red X and puts a circle around it. The shot zooms out to reveal
the entire valley – no longer a painting on the brick wall. Lighting
strikes at the horizon. Dark clouds loom over the three farmers’
compounds. It looks exactly like one of Mrs. Fox’s paintings of a
landscape in a rainstorm. Bean’s helicopter circles the area.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Why’d he write this in letters cut out of
magazines?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know, but you did the same thing.</p>
<p>****: I don’t trust this guy. Anyway, set up the ambush.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Could I have a cup of water, please?
Kristofferson waits for a reply, but no one answers. He whistles to
himself for a minute. He clears his throat again. He calls out:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Excuse me! Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Synchronize your clocks. The time is</p>
<p><strong>now –</strong>: Fox looks at his wrist. He is wearing Rat’s
plastic, digital, sports-themed wristwatch.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: – nine forty-five A.M. Everyone checks their
watches. Badger points at Fox’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Is that Rat’s watch?</p>
<p>****: No. Originally, no.</p>
<p>****: Well, OK, here’s the back-story: when I was a teenager I spent
a summer working as a bar-back at a jazz pub called Django’s where Rat
played horn down near – can I tell this another time? We should stay
focused on what’s happening right now. Ash comes up to Fox’s side and
says discreetly:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I should probably ride with you and Kylie since
it’s my fault Kristofferson got captured stealing those nutmeg-ginger-
apple snaps.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t understand a word of that sentence, but none of it
matters, anyway, because it’s too dangerous for you to come with us.</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: Rat’s watch. It is now 10 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Six armed farmhands on the roof of the
Nag’s Head Tavern.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Seven armed farmhands in the bushes behind
Sweetings Bakery.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Eight armed farmers in the window of
Harrison Travel.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The Action 13 reporter and camera crew in
an alley next to St. John’s Coin-op Laundry.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Did you bring the boy?</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Of course, we did! Say something, kid! Bunce
presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson’s voice comes over a
loudspeaker:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson’s voice</strong>: Excuse me! Excuse me? Bunce
presses stop.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and his entourage at the bottom off the
manhole. Fox scoffs. He smiles and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Come on! That doesn’t sound anything like him!
It’s amateur night in Dixie! Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint
together. A bit chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on
some kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: What the cuss is he burning? A blazing
pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies through the air, over the
farmers’ heads. It lands in a trash can and lights some rubbish on fire.
A man with a dart in one hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of
the Nag’s Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes out.
The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Is that all you’ve got, Mr. Fox? Twenty-seven
blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and hit: a wood-pile on the
roof of the Nag’s Head, a box of pastry wrappers in the bushes behind
Sweetings, a stack of brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay
bale in the bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate
of cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and tamping out the
flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and scramble in the confusion. Rabbit
darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six farmers chase after
him, firing their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>mole</strong>: Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two
targets hit! Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks
quickly on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television set
sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13’s coverage of the chaos in the
street.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Rabbit running full-steam out of the
village being pursued by the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke
bottle lying on its side in the road.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in
the sidecar. They both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the
distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox over the
sound of the motor:</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Are you scared of wolves?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Scared, no! I have a phobia of them!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Well, I have a thing about thunder!</p>
<p>****: Why? That’s stupid! Ash pokes his head up from the rear
compartment of the sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His
white cape flutters behind him. He shouts:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I don’t like needles! Fox and Kylie look to Ash
in disbelief. Fox says furiously:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Where’d you come from again? How’d you get in
the sidecar? I feel like I’m losing my mind! Fox angrily steers toward a
small mound of dirt. They jump it slightly and fly over a little ditch.
Ash yelps enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’ve got a fox on a motorcycle with a littler
fox and what looks to be an opossum in the sidecar riding north on farm
lane seven. Does that sound like anything to anybody? A military-type
voice responds over the radio:</p>
<p><strong>military voice</strong>: Roger that, Red. Let me just, uh –
Oh, I think the boss wants to –</p>
<p><strong>bean</strong>: Red, it’s Franklin Bean! Turn around, get the
cuss back here, and pick us up on the</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s the annex over there on the right. Ash
nods. Kylie does not respond.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: The white building over there on the right.
Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kylie? Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him
vacantly. Fox says</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kylie!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: I did it!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: When? I didn’t see it! Kylie makes his slight
gesture with his paw. The gardener puts three turnips into a basket and
rides away on his bicycle. Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree
trunk. They come out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through
the gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Kylie, you got a credit card?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>****: See, this is what I was saying about how good you are at just
being available for</p>
<p><strong>whatever –</strong>: Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler
Titanium Card. Fox frowns.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you qualify
for this?</p>
<p>****: I pay my bills on time. I’ve always had good credit. Fox
examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock and opens the
doors. The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a compost heap. On
the other side, there is an old, rusted, broken-down tractor and a new
one. By far the largest, fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in
the middle. White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck reads
Spitz. Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens his
eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Give me a blueberry. Kylie looks surprised. He
shrugs. He shakes his head and gestures, I don’t have any. Fox frowns.
He throws up his hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox
points at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away and
spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: What’s that white stuff around his mouth?</p>
<p>****: I think he eats soap. Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy
bottle on a shelf above some bags of fertilizer. It’s reads: Drug:
Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg</p>
<p><strong>breed: beagle</strong>: For: RABIES Other: Take with meat, do
not operate heavy machinery Fox frowns. He says grimly:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s not soap.</p>
<p>****: Well, then why does he have that bubbly –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He’s rabid. With rabies. I’ve heard about this
beagle. The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Easy, boy. Fox takes a cautious step toward the
beagle. He holds out the back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He
says back over his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m going to try to befriend him. I feel like
there’s a tenderness in his eyes. Fox takes another step. He makes a
soft, kissing noise. The beagle watches him calmly.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yes, I’m right. He’s a good boy. A little
lonely, maybe, but – Fox takes another cautious step.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: – but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy. Is
your name Spitz? That’s German, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: I thought he said you never look a beagle in
the eye.</p>
<p>****: Why, you’re just as sweet as a – Fox and the beagle lock eyes.
The pupils of the beagle’s eyes contract then completely disappear, and
the whites turn bright red. Fox’s eyes open wider than their sockets.
The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an enraged maniac.
His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie, and Ash shriek and scream,
sprinting frantically around the courtyard as the rabid beagle,
frothing, roaring, and snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox
shouts, his voice cracking like a grandmother’s:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Climb the trellis! In well under a second, Fox,
Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis six stories – Kylie’s pants catching on
a nail and ripping off on the way up – and find themselves standing on
the roof of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look down at the
rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane fit, running in circles
after its tail at the bottom of the courtyard. Fox takes in their new
surroundings. He says, pleased:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: So the attic is probably in the area right up
around here somewhere, I figure, huh? Kylie and Ash, panting and
dripping with sweat, both stare at Fox vacantly.</p>
<p>****: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie’s</p>
<p>****: Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good. That’s just some dog.
Let’s not get traumatized.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The street below. An orange and yellow
Citroen van screeches into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell
Badoit et Fils, Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with
an image of a trapped fox. An old man with a grey moustache and a young
man with a black moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped
uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and start
unloading stacks of metal cages.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Rabbit still running full-steam down a
country lane being pursued by the six farmhands.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room
with three different- colored shoelaces tied together and belted around
his waist. Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a
mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the apple
crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Can I get one of those karate lessons real
quick?</p>
<p>****: OK. Normally, we start with some breathing exercises and such.
Stand like this. Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of
him. Ash mimics this.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A fox-trap hanging from a chain suspended
above the alley behind the Nag’s Head Tavern. A second one hangs behind
Sweetings Bakery. A third one hangs behind Harrison Travel. A fourth one
hangs behind St. John’s Coin-op Laundry. A fifth one hangs behind
Ferguson Cobblers. Rickity curiously examines a little, hanging wire. He
mutters</p>
<p><strong>rickity</strong>: Is this spring-loaded?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Kristofferson continuing Ash’s karate
lesson:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: This next part is mental. Position
yourself on the balls of your feet. Kristofferson stands lightly poised
with his arms out. Ash mimics this.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Close your eyes. Kristofferson closes
his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and Kylie. Kristofferson says
mystically:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: You weigh less than a slice of
bread.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Each fox-trap in rapid succession as it
falls on: Rickity, Badger, Weasel, and Beaver. The two small rabbits
watch from a sewer-gutter drain under the street-curb. They panic. They
race down a pipe, into a tunnel, and through a conduit.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Kristofferson continuing Ash’s karate
lesson:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Let’s review the principle agility
techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Mrs. Fox looking down from her ladder at
the three, panting rabbits. She looks stunned. She motions to her
mural/map and</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Show me where they are!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The two small rabbits, Mrs. Rabbit,
Mrs. Badger, Mole, and Mrs. Fox each furiously digging a new tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Now for a rudimentary version of the
cyclone chop.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Kristofferson continuing Ash’s karate
lesson:</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: First, you need to get a running
start, which, obviously, I can’t do in here, then, as you arrive at the
destination of the chop –</p>
<p>****: – lean and thrust into the point of contact, paw remains open
and straight, then withdraw instantaneously. Remember, it’s the
pull-back that matters. The pull-</p>
<p>****: – generates the force of the impact.</p>
<p>****: Got it. Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf.
Fox and Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly:</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: He’s going to do it! Fox makes a face that
says, I’m not so sure. Ash takes a deep breath. He screams at the top of
his lungs as he sprints toward the apple crate:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Ki-ya! Ash’s toe catches on a loose nail. He
somersaults twice through the air and bounces off the side of the apple
crate, which falls off the shelf. Kristofferson braces himself. The
apple crate hits the floor and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies
among the wreckage. Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie
watch from above, grimacing.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p>****: That’s all right. You were just trying to unlock the apple
crate.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No, I mean I’m sorry about –</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Oh, you mean from before. The apology
you owed me which you never actually said.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Yeah. Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep
breath. He nods again.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: That’s all right, too. Throw me the
shoelace, please. Ash smiles.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Badger trapped in his cage. He hears
something. He looks quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns
the corner and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into
the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:</p>
<p><strong>badger</strong>: Badoit et fils.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your posse
hunted my family. Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
wife – and you shot off my tail.</p>
<p>****: I’m not leaving here without that neck- tie. Bean smiles his
sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly. Kylie looks utterly baffled.
Ash says mystically:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I weigh less than a slice of bread.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’ll be right back. Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and
Kristofferson watch, shocked, as Ash sprints back to the courtyard
doors. The three farmers open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson
duck and take cover behind a hay-bale.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Ki-ya! Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock
clicks. Ash’s eyes light up. Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and
burrows into the dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through
his nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw hanging
open. The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears out
into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and thrashing crazily. The
farmers shriek and scream and run around, panicking, with their guns
blazing. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their motorcycle.
The beagle rips the tail from Bean’s neck, shreds it, chews it up, and
swallows it. Fox deflates for an instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash
on the back of the motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox’s
waist. He says with the deepest affection and respect:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Ash, that was pure, wild animal craziness.
You’re an athlete. Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.</p>
<p>****: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash will be
used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and Fox kick-starts the
motorcycle and races across the farm. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble
onto the roof of a car port with an old, white Mercedes convertible
under it. The snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the edge of the
property. He guns the motor and yells:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Holy swearing cuss!!!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the
roof of the car port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling
him:</p>
<p><strong>boggis</strong>: Franklin? You got any final twist for this
plot?</p>
<p>****: Yeah! Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce
starts throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the rabid
beagle continues to go bananas below them.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing
underneath it and a hole in the ground. The old man with the grey
moustache turns to his son and says with a strong French accent:</p>
<p><strong>badoit</strong>: Cuss.</p>
<p><strong>mole</strong>: Stand by! Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is
holding the tin can with the string attached to it to his ear. He nods
and says urgently:</p>
<p><strong>mole</strong>: I just intercepted a high-frequency radio
signal with the can – – and I think they’re on their way home!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Rabbit still running full-steam back into
the village being pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole
where they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the
manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag’s Head, walk inside,
and close the door behind them.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Don’t turn around!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What? Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf
with ice-blue eyes stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams
on the brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Where’d he come from?</p>
<p>****: Where’d you come from? What are you doing here? Pause. Fox
points toward the wolf:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Canis lupus! Fox points to himself:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Vulpes Vulpes! The wolf does not answer. Fox,
Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson watch idling from the motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I don’t think he speaks English or Latin.</p>
<p>****: Pensez-vous que 1’hiver sera rude?</p>
<p>****: I’m asking if he thinks we’re in for a hard winter.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He doesn’t seem to know. Silence. Fox shouts to
the wolf with a strange hitch in his</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I have a phobia of wolves! The wolf does not
answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth open. Its teeth are long,
sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs out, and its eyes are wild. Fox
looks back at it with the identical expression for a minute, mesmerized
– then Fox closes his mouth and his eyes soften. Fox raises his paw in
the air. The wolf blinks a few times. It raises its paw in the air. It
turns away and trots off into the woods. Fox says wistfully:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck, boys.
Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning tires, and they
tear off down the road. The shot booms down into the ground, below the
grass, through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean mineral
deposits.</p>
<p><strong>title:</strong>: THREE DAYS LATER The shot continues to
descend past Badger and his family having dinner in a nicely furnished
drain-pipe, past Rabbit and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the
stolen, portable television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past
Beaver and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
tasteful sewer-conduit. The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to
the brick cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox’s former view of the
valley as seen from their tree with a trompe 1’oeil window-frame around
it. It is signed Felicity Fox. Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style
meditating on a braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine
at an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up copy of
the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room under a glowing
lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: My darlings? Everyone looks to Fox. He signals
them to follow him.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: We were in the middle of a meditation
practice.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Watch your step. Fox takes everyone through an
opening and starts climbing a metal ladder. He says theatrically:</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Let’s see, now. Where does this lead?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Oh, no, Foxy. It’s filthy.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Keep a good grip, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: This better be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I think I see a little sliver of light. What’s
this? Is that a door?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You’re a terrible actor, Foxy.</p>
<p><strong>kristofferson</strong>: Do you smell something? Is that –</p>
<p>****: – freon?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shh. I’m going to crack open this trap door and
see if something’s on the other side. I highly doubt it, though. There’s
probably just more sewer. Fox clears his throat. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You know, wouldn’t it be surprising if –</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Open it. Fox pushes open the trap door and
crawls out. Everyone follows him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Hey, look! There’s a whole, enormous, glorious,
gigantic supermarket up here! Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox
raises an eyebrow and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: You really are kind of a quote-unquote
fantastic fox.</p>
<p>****: I try. I guess now that Kristofferson’s dad’s already down to
single-pneumonia and getting better, he’ll be going home soon, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Actually, when he spoke to me from the
hospital, he said he was already talking</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Oh, really? Well, now’s the time to buy. Kylie
comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature shopping cart
filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives, pickles, and honey, plus three
loaves of bread, Band-Aids, toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice
cream. He says</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Did I hear my name?</p>
<p>****: Not down here, you didn’t.</p>
<p>****: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Because we were talking about other things.</p>
<p>****: Oh, well. Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of
tropical juice punch-boxes.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: The white cape rather suits him, doesn’t it?
Actually, I had to do quite a bit of searching myself before I found a
look that really flattered me. Remember those horseshoe cuff-links? Fox
and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and stops. He
stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She hesitates. She
shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I’m pregnant again. Fox is confused and
moved. He holds Mrs. Fox’s face in his paws. She smiles. Ash
interrupts:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Should we dance? Pause. Everyone breaks out
giddily dancing an ecstatic jig. Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox
spins Mrs. Fox.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the
supermarket stacked with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars
of every possible variety of food. The family of foxes continues to
dance at the distant end of the center aisle.</p>
