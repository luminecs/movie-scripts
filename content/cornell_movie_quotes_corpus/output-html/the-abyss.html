<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sixty knots? No way, Barnes… the reds don’t
have anything that fast.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Checked it twice, skipper. It’s a real
unique signature. No cavitation, no reactor noise… doesn’t even sound
like screws.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: I’ll tell you what it’s not, it’s not one of
ours.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Sir! Contact changing heading to
two-one-four, diving. Speed eighty knots! Eighty knots!</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Eighty knots…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Still diving, depth nine hundred feet. Port
clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Still diving, depth nine hundred feet. Port
clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: It’s getting tight in here.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We can still give him a haircut. Helm, come
right to oh six niner, down five degrees.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Coming right to oh six niner, sir. Down
five degrees.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Port side clearance one hundred twenty
feet narrowing to seventy-five. Sir, we have a proximity warning
light.</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: That’s too damn close! We’ve gotta back
off.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Range to contact, two hundred. Contact
junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to… one hundred thirty
knots, sir!</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Nothing goes one thirty!</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Turbulence! We’re in its wake!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Helm, all stop! Full right rudder!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: All stop. Full right rudder. Hydraulic
failure. Planes are not responding, sir!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Hydraulics restored, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Collision alarm! Collision alarm! Lighten
her up, Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: The torpedo room is flooded, sir!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Blow all tanks! Blow everything!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Passing twelve hundred feet…</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Blowing main tanks!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Twelve hundred fifty feet…</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Main forward tanks ruptured!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Passing thirteen hundred feet…</p>
<p><strong>exec</strong>: Too deep to pump auxiliaries!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: All back full! All back full!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Answering all back full. Passing thirteen
hundred fifty feet… fourteen hundred… fourteen fifty…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’re losing her. Launch the buoy!</p>
<p><strong>long lens shot</strong>: three massive Navy Sea King
helicopters thundering straight at us, FILLING FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Does not look good at all.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: No light from the surface. How deep are
they?</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Seventeen hundred feet.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: I need them to go to over two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: They can do it. Get Brigman on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, you guys are milking that job.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: That’s cause we love freezin’ our butts off
out here sooo much, boss.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Bud! Hippy’s on the bitch-box. It’s a call
from topside. That new company man.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Kirkhill? That guy doesn’t know his butt from a
rathole. Hey, Perry!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
those cable slings. This place is starting to look like my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m coming. Keep your pantyhose on.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Brigman here. Kirkhill? What’s going on? I am
calm. I’m a calm person. Is there some reason why I shouldn’t be
calm?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All divers. Drop what you’re doing. Everybody
out of the pool.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Here you go, hon’.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Just in time, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Dammit, we just got out here.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: There was a time when I would have asked
why.</p>
<p><strong>finler</strong>: What’s goin’ on? How come we got
recalled?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Hell is I know.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Just follow standard procedure, will ya…
flog the dog till somebody tells us what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Hey, Catfish, I’ll sell you my October
Penthouse for twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Save you money, darlin’… the pages are
all stuck together by now.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: What’s goin’ on, Boss?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Folks, I’ve just been told to shut down the
hole and prepare to move the rig.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: She-hit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We’re being asked to cooperate in a matter of
national security. Now you know exactly as much as I do. So just get
your gear off and get up to control. There’s some kind of briefing in
ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: At 09:22 local time this morning, an
American nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men aboard, went
down 22 miles from here. There has been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: Your company has authorized the Navy’s use
of this facility for a rescue operation. The code name is Operation
Salvor.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: You want us to search for the sub?</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: No. We know where it is. But she’s in 2000
feet of water and we can’t reach her. We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors, if any.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t you guys have your own stuff for this
type of thing?</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: By the time we get our rescue submersible
here the storm front will be right on us. But you can get your rig in
under the storm and be on- site in fifteen hours. That makes you our
best option right now.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Why should we risk our butts on a job like
this?</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: I have been authorized to offer you all
special- duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Hell, for triple time I’d crawl through
razor blades and shower off with lime juice.</p>
<p><strong>finler</strong>: I’m here to tell ya’, you could set me on
fire and call me names.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, I don’t know what kind of a deal you guys
worked out with the company, but my people are not qualified for this…
they’re oil workers.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to
you to supervise the operation.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You can send down whoever you like, but I’m the
toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the safety of these people,
there’s me… then there’s God. Understand? If things get dicey, I’m
pulling the plug.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: I think we’re all on the same wavelength,
Brigman. Now let’s get the wellhead uncoupled, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: When Lindsey finds out about this, it’s not
gonna be a pretty sight.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: They’re going to have to shoot her with a
tranquilizer gun.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: No way I’m putting her down. I shouldn’t even
be flying in this shit.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just hold it over the deck.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You want to be on that ship, there’s only
one way it’s going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fred, huh? I don’t know. Hurricanes should be
named after women.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I can’t believe you let them do this!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the
last flight out here. Only here isn’t where I left it, is it, Bud?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wasn’t up to me.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We were that close to proving a submersible
drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole
down for Chrissake. I can’t believe you let them grab my rig!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Your rig?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: My rig. I designed the damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as
long as they’re hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They
bought you… more like least rented you cheap–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m switching off now.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand
up to fight. You–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: God, I hate that bitch.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Yeah, well you never should have married her
then.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Let’s go, gentlemen! We either launch now
or we don’t launch.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Take her up, Byron!</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: What the hell is she doing out there? Son
of a bitch… Lindsey… get out of Cab Three. Bates is taking her down.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bates is sick. Besides I’ve got more hours
in this thing than he does. A little change of plan.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Lady, we better fish or cut bait.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we
gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: I don’t care who drives the damn thing.
Just get my team in the water.</p>
<p><strong>kirkhill</strong>: Alright, alright. Christ Almighty!</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Cab Three, you are clear to launch.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Roger. There’s only one way it’s going to
happen…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Touchdown. The crowd goes wild. Explorer…
Cab Three. We are styling.</p>
<p><strong>bud/hippy</strong>: … I’ve been driving every kinda rig
that’s</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Deepcore, Deepcore… this is Cab Three on
final approach.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You,
Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: None other.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh no… you gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Howdy, y’all. Hey, Lindsey! I’ll be damned!
You shouldn’t be down here sweet thing, ya’ll might run ya
stockings.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Couldn’t stay away. You running mixture for
us? Good. Couldn’t ask for better.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Okay, here we go. Start equalizing,
y’all.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six
hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it’s gonna take us
three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: We’ve been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Don’t call me that, okay… I hate that.
Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS…</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle
tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability,
disorientation.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Very good. About one person in twenty just
can’t handle it. They go buggo. They’re no way to predict who’s
susceptible, so stay alert.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Look, we’ve all made chamber runs to this
depth. We’re checked out.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Oh… chamber runs. Uh huh, that’s good.
Well, hey… you guys know any songs?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Those guys ain’t so tough. I fought plenty
of guys tougher’n them.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
contender.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: You see this? They used to call this the
Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Hippy wasn’t born then.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Curiosity killed the cat.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Y’all’er done to a turn and ready to serve.
Everybody okay?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hey, was there a wall here before? I don’t
remember a wall here. Oh, Jammer! Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Howdy, there, little lady.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Show us the dive prep area. We need to check
out your gear.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Those guys are about a much fun as a tax
audit.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hippy, you’re going to give that rat a
disease.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You never did like being called that, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Not even when it meant something. Is that
One Night up in Flatbed?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>linsey</strong>: Hi, One Night, it’s Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Oh, hi, Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I can’t believe you were dumb enough to come
down. Now you’re stuck here for the storm… dumb, hot-rod… dumb.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Look, I didn’t come down here to fight.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Then why’d you come down?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You need me. Nobody knows the systems on
this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the
Explorer clears off? What would have you done?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wow, you’re right! Us poor dumb ol’ boys
might’ve had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You wanna know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is
set! Morons.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I think you were worried about me.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: That must be it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No, I think you were. Come on, admit it.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I was worried about the rig. I’ve got over
four years invested in this project.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh, yeah, right… and you only had three years
with me.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You’ve got to have priorities.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: My bunk’s the only one I can guarantee won’t be
occupied. You can grab a couple hours before we get there.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: What are you still wearing that for?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t know. Divorce ain’t final. Forgot to
take it off.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I haven’t worn mine in months.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah, what’s-his-name wouldn’t like it. The
Suit.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Do you always have to call him that? The
Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: So what about “Michael” then… Mr. Brooks
Brothers… Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No, I haven’t seen him in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, why are you doing this? It’s not part
of you life any more.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’ll tell you what happened… you woke up one
day and realized the guy never made you laugh.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You’re right, Bud. It was just that simple.
Aren’t you clever? You should get your own show… Ask Dr. Bud, advice to
the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: This is us. We’re just on the edge of the
Cayman Trough. The Montana is here, on its side, 300 meters away and 70
meters below us. We think she slid down the wall, and lodged against
this outcropping.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: This tells us how much radiation we get?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Hey, whoah… I can’t handle no radiation, man.
Forget it! Include me out.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Hippy, you pussy.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: What good’s the money if your dick drops off
in six months?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: We’ll take reading as we go. If the
reactor’s breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris,
we’ll back away. Simple.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay… Hippy’s not going… McWhirter, you can run
Little Geek.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: No way! No way! He can’t fly an ROV worth
shit. I’ll go. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me, and you will follow my instructions
without discussion. Is this clear? Alright, I want everyone finished
prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, it’s three AM. These guys are running on
bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better start cutting them some
slack.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I can’t afford slack, Brigman.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, you come on my rig, you don’t talk to me,
you start ordering my guys around. It won’t work. You gotta know how to
handle these people… we have a certain way of doing things here.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I’m not interested in your way of doing
things. Just get your team ready to dive.</p>
<p><strong>finler</strong>: Hey, you know your hand is blue?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Shut up and get your gear on.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: I’ve been meaning to ask you what this thing
is.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We
use it if we need to go really deep.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: How deep?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Deep. It’s classified… you know. Anyway, you
breathe liquid, so you can’t be compressed. Pressure doesn’t get to
you.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: You’re saying you get liquid in your
lungs?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: See? He’s diggin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: This is no bullshit hands down the
goddamnedest thing I ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Com-check, everybody. Flatbed, you on
line?</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and
clear.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Cab Three?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Cab Three, check. Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: What’s you depth, Cab Three?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: 1840… 50… 60… 70…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065.
Everybody stay tight and in sight.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Starting out descent. Divers, how’re you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay so far.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: How deep’s the drop-off here?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: This here’s the bottomless pit, baby. Two
and a half miles straight down.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Knock off the chatter. Cab One, you getting
anything?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Cab One, do you see it yet?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is
showing a big return, but I don’t see anything yet. Are you sure you got
the depth right on this?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Uh, yeah, roger that… uh, found it.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Cab One, radiation readings?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Neutron counter’s not showing very
much.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Wilhite, anything?</p>
<p><strong>wilhite</strong>: Negative. Nominal.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just continue forward along the hull.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Copy that, continuing forward. You just
want me to get shots of everything, right?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
moving. We’re on a tight timeline.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: That’s the midship hatch. You see it, Cab
Three?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Roger, I see it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Just get around so your lights are on the
hatch.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Check. Then I just hang with these guys,
right?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: How do you want me?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just hold above it. Alright, A team.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Stand by on the ROV.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Perry, stand by on the ROV. Sorry about this,
little buddy. Better you than me, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: It’s flooded. Alright, I’m opening her up.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Radiation is nominal. The warheads must
still be intact.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: How many are there?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: 24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per
missile.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: That’s 192 warheads… And how powerful are
they?</p>
<p><strong>schoenick</strong>: Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
nominal yield. Say times time Hiroshima.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Jesus Christ… this is World War Three in a
can.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Let’s knock off the chatter, please.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Getting a reading?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: It’s twitching but it’s below the line you
said was safe.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Alright. Let’s get in there.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: We’ll go in through that large breach.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Let’s go, guys.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
sight. Watch for hatches that could close on you, or any loose equipment
that could fall.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: It’s jammed. Give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Alright, let’s keep moving. We knew we were
going to see this.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: How you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I’m alright, I’m dealing.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.
It ain’t. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We’re here now. Let’s get her done.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: This part I do alone. Brigman, take you men
and continue aft. Split up into two teams of two. Let’s get moving… we
head back in fourteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny. You guys stay on this
deck. Hook you line onto mine. Any problem, you tug my line. Two pulls.
Jammer, you’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Missile compartment. Those are the launch
tubes.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Lord Almighty.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just
breathe easy.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: I… they’re all dead, Bud. They’re all dead.
I thought… some of them… you know…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I’m taking you back out.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: No! I’m okay now. I just don’t… I can’t go
any further in.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here.
I have to go there to the end… you’ll see my lights. We’ll stay in voice
contact. Just hold onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Yeah, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Bud? BUD?! You readin’ me? BUD?!!</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Bud? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Jammer? Answer me, buddy, JAMMER?!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hang on, big guy. Hand on!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: He’s convulsing!</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: It’s his mixture! Too much oxygen!</p>
<p><strong>finler</strong>: Crank it down, man! We’re gonna losing
him…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: SHIT, it’s stuck… goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: You got it?! You got it?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah, yeah… yeah. It’s turning.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We gotta get him out of here. Come on! Hang on,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: CAB ONE! CAB ONE! Meet me at Flatbed! This is a
diver emergency!! Do you copy? Lindsey?!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Copy you, Bud. On my way.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Whattya think?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: I’m a medic, which is mostly about patching
holes. This type of thing… there’s not much I can do. The coma could
last hours or days.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Negative. But there was definitely a Russian
bogey. The Brigman woman saw it.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: CINCLANTFLT’s gonna go apeshit. Two Russian
attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked within fifty miles of
here… and now we don’t know what the hell they are. Okay, I don’t have
any choice. I’m confirming you to go to Phase Two.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: Is there any problem?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Yes… I mean no. Negative, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No. Look, forget it. I don’t want to talk
about it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fine. Be that way.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I don’t know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants
to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It’s a Russian submersible. No
problem.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: But you think it’s something else. What? One of
ours?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Jammer saw something in there, something
that scared the hell out him–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and
pranged his regulator.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: But what did he see that made him
panic?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What do you think he saw?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I don’t know. I DON’T KNOW!</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Hey, you guys… hurry up, check this out!
They’re announcing it.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Quiet! Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Turn it up, bozo.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: … the Kremlin continues to deny
Russian</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Hey that’s us!</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: –are apparently participating in the
recovery operation but we have little information about their
involvement. On the scene now is–</p>
<p><strong>finler</strong>: BOOOOH! We want names!</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Hey, hey! There’s the Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: –there is a tremendous amount of activity.
With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup of US ships and
aircraft in the area has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow
and has led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the Caribbean
theater.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: How would you describe the mood
there?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The mood is one of suspicion, even
confrontation. A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers, undoubtedly
surveillance vessels, have been circling within a few miles throughout
the day, and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away from the
area…</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Now we’re right in the middle of this
big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or
something.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Figured that out for yourself, did you?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit!
Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.
Give our folks medals, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hippy, just relax. You’re making the women
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Cute, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren’t telling us
diddly. Something’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hippy, you think everything’s a conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Everything is.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Hurry up! Coffey’s splitting with
Flatbed! He got me to show him the controls, then his guys suited up and
they’re rolling.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Goddamnit! D’you tell him we need it right
now?</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: I told him we had to get the umbilical
unhooked</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: We’re trying to get unhooked and get out of
here… and your boys go sightseeing!</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: They’ll be back in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Two hours?! We’re gonna be getting the shit
kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!</p>
<p><strong>tight on video screen</strong>: A HELICOPTER SHOT of a
warship burning, rolling ponderously as it sinks in stormy seas.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Little is known at this hour about the
events leading up to the collision. The US Navy guided missile cruiser
Appleton apparently struck the Soviet ‘Udaloy’ class destroyer in low
visibility conditions…</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: In violent seas little hope remains for
over a hundred Russian crewmen still missing after the sinking an hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Soviet military spokesmen have claimed
that the collision constituted an unprovoked attack. This was
denied–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, this is big time.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … just learned that Soviet negotiators
have</p>
<p><strong>another newscaster</strong>: … US and NATO military forces
have been put on</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s on every channel.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: You just feel so hopeless. You can see
it coming, but what can you do? What can anyone do?</p>
<p><strong>construction worker</strong>: Hey, they don’t want war any
more than we do. You think about it, you say… hey, they love their kids
too. So why are we doing this?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If the Russians sank that submarine, they
deserve what they got and a lot more, if you ask me, and you did. I
think we’ve been pussyfooting around with them long enough.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Scared? I’m scared ____-less. But if it happens
it happens, nothing I can do about it. Right? So why think about it?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Don’t touch that. Just step away. Now!</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Excusez moi.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Coffey, we’re a little pressed for time.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Monk, Schoenick… secure the package.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This ain’t no drill, slick. Make me proud.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Piece of cake, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: We’re losing number two thruster. Bearing’s
going.</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: It’s not holding. We’re swinging out of
position!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Topside, topside… pay out some slack, we’re
getting dragged!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We’re heading right for the drop off!</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Bud! We’ve lost the crane!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What? Say again.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Got it! It’s dropping straight to us.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Rig for impact! Seal all exterior hatches. Move
it! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hey! Get on this hose, you turkeys!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No! Hold it on me!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Heeyy!! HHHEEEYYY!!</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you
read, over? This is Deepcore–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Forget it, Sonny. They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Did you find Wilhite?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Brigman. I was under orders. I had no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s the scoop, ace?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I can get power to this module and sub-bay
if I remote these busses. I’ve gotta get past the mains, which are a
total melt-down.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud… there
won’t be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is
going to be as cold as a meat locker.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What about O-2?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Brace yourself. We’ve got about 12 hours
worth if we close off the sections we’re not using.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: The storm’s gonna last longer than 12
hours.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I can extend that. There’s some storage
tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I’ll have to go outside to tie
onto them.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, Lins… I’m glad your here.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Yeah? Well I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Right through the brainpan. Deader’n
dogshit, boss.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Where’re you?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Quarters. Level two.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: That’s Perry.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: That’s it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and
Perry. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Do we just leave him there?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah, for now. Our first priority’s to get
something to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There’s
some tanks on the other side; I’m gonna go check them out.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: You watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long
extension. So there you were–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
for two months. I’m tool-pusher and we’re testing this automated derrick
of hers. So, we get back on the beach and… we’re living together.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Doesn’t mean you had to marry her.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We were due to go back out on the same ship.
Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise
it was bunks.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Okay, good reason. Then what?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It was alright for a while, you know. But then
she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: She went front-office on you. Tighten
that for me, right there. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive–
Son of a–!!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: She didn’t leave me… she just left me
behind.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Bud, let me tell you something. She ain’t
half as smart as she thinks she is.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Hey, Lindsey, you reading me? Over.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Yeah, Hippy, I read you. What’s the
matter?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Lins, how’re you doing? Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Catfish… I got a problem here. You there?
Catfish?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You better not say you missed that.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Missed what?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nice shot, Lins.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: What is that? You drop your dive light?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Come on, you guys… look, this is the little
one right here. You can see how it’s kind of zigging around.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: If you say so. It could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I’m telling you what is there. You’re just
not hearing. The impulses somehow aren’t getting from you ears to your
brainpan. There’s something down there. Something not… us.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Y’all could be more specific.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non-
human, but intelligent…</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: You mean like Coffey?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: A non-terrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I
like that better then UFOs. Although that works too… Underwater Flying
Objects.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Are we talkin’ little space friend
here?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Right on! Hot rods of the Gods. Right, Lins?
Hey, no really! It could be NTIs. The CIA has known about them for
years. They abduct people all the time. There was this woman I knew in
Albuquerque who–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hippy, do me a favor… stay off my side.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Lindsey, will you step into my office for a
minute…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Jesus, Lindsey–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, something really important is
happening here.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look. I’m just trying to hold this situation
together. I can’t allow you to cause this kind of hysteria–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Who’s hysterical? Nobody’s hysterical!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All I’m saying is when you’re hanging on by
your fingernails, you don’t go waving you arms around.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I saw something! I’m not going to go back
there and say I didn’t see it when I did. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever
knew.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me.
Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any
tremors, slurred speech?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me
better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips… I saw these things.
I touched one of them. And it wasn’t some clunky steel can like we would
build… it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: It was a machine, but it seems almost
alive. Like a… dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me… please. I
don’t think they mean us harm. I don’t know how I know that, it’s just a
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey’s
going to go on you ‘feeling’?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We all see what we want to see… Coffey
looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look
with better eyes than that.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I can’t, Lindsey. I’m sorry. How can I?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: I want ’round-the-clock manning of the sonar
shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet
craft try another incursion.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live
three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust
me… they’re not speaking Russian.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Why haven’t you finished repairs on the
hydrophone transmitter yet?</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: I was having my nails done.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Get something straight. You people are under
my authority–</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Look, podner… we don’t work for you, we
don’t take orders from you, and we don’t much like you. In addition to
which your momma dresses you funny.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: ‘Fish’?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Yuh?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you
handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that
transmitter working for me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Gimme a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Come on… move to the left… just a little
more… come on, A.J. Squared Away… that’s it–</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Pretty radical, guys. Pretty radical.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Say hello to MIRV.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Come on, man. What else could it be?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why bring it here?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: It’s gotta be, like, an emergency plan to
keep it away from the Russians… Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda
detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker’n
snot. Oh, uh… hi, Lins.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Look, goddamnit, if you won’t do something
about it, I will.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Lindsey! Wait a second–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You’ve got some huevos bringing this…
thing… into my rig! With everything that’s been going on up in the
world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone as
particularly psychotic, or is it just me?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: You don’t need to know the details of this
mission… you’re better off if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You’re right… I don’t. I just need to know
that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Mrs. Brigman, you’re becoming a serious
impediment to this mission. I believe the stress is affecting you.
Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bullshit, you can’t do that. Oww…
goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Emergency! Maintenance room B. Emergency!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Let her go. Do it… right now.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You dumb jarhead motherf–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Chill out, Lindsey!!</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: They can’t be trusted. They’re turning
against us. We may have to take… steps.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Yeah. The dude’s in bad shape… you see his
hands?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: He’s got the shakes?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Look, the guy’s operating on his own, cut off
from chain of command. He’s exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced
psychosis. And he’s got a nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me…
will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
nine point five.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Look, you can just punch into his little
chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain’t gonna
be fancy. When he gets down there he’ll just sit, like a dumb-shit.
Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you’ll get
nada.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Let’s go for it. We could get lucky.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: I don’t know. I really oughta talk to Bud
about this.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No. Just you and me. We get some proof,
then tell them. Hippy, look… if was can prove to Coffey it’s not
Russians, maybe he’ll ease off the button a little.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot
more than whatever’s down there. A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead
robot. Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Virgil, turn on your side.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: All set, big guy. Hey, I told you to wipe
that grin off your face.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I think it likes you.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: It’s trying to communicate.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Seawater.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Show off.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Okay, raise your hand if you think that was
a Russian water-tentacle. Lieutenant? No? Well, a breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You done impressing yourself, ace?</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: No way that could just be seawater.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: They must’ve learned how to control water…
I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it…
whatever. Put it under intelligent control.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
Controlling water.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: That thing was probably their version of Big
Geek… like an ROV.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Just checking is out, huh? How come?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: They’re curious, maybe. We could be the
first people they’ve seen up close.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Hope they don’t judge the whole race offa
us.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Maybe I oughta shave.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: It went straight for the warhead. And they
think it’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>schoenick</strong>: You need to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: We have no way of warning the surface. Do
you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: It means… whatever happens is up to us.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: You think they’re from down there
originally? Or from… you know.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I think they’re from ‘you know’. Some place
that has similar conditions… cold, intense pressure. No light.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
prob’ly.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Sniff something did you, rat boy?</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: FREEZE! Don’t move. That’s it. Here, hold
this a second. We’re going to phase three.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: They’re using Big Geek to take the bomb to
the NTIs! We set it up to go right to them.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Oh my God… Oh no… Please, you can’t.
Coffey, think about what you’re doing… for God’s sake–</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: This is something I’ve wanted to do since I
first met you.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: You boss is having a full-on meltdown. Guy’s
fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we’re all ringside!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: What’s the timer set for?</p>
<p><strong>schoenick</strong>: Three hours.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Shut up! Don’t talk!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: We can’t get to minimum-safe-distance in three
hours. The shockwave will kill us. It’ll crush this rig like a semi
driving over a beer can.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Shut up! SHUT UP! What’s the matter with
you?!</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Just stay calm. The situation is under
control.</p>
<p><strong>coffey</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Schoenick… your Lieutenant is about to make
a real bad career move…</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: That guy’s crazier’n a shithouse rat!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: We have to stop him! Schoenick!!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: … he’s about to declare war on an alien
species,</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: I’m the least of your problems.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?</p>
<p><strong>jammer</strong>: Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
angel comin’ toward me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Uh, okay, right. You can tell us about it
later. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: He’s jammed the mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay, I’m gonna free-swim to hatch six… get
inside, get the door open from the other side.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, that water’s only a couple degrees
above freezing.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Wish us luck. ’Case I don’t die. Okay, Bud…
let’s go, podner, I ain’t got all day.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hafta… go on to… the moonpool. Only way.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: I can’t… make it… podner.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay, Cat. You head back.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: He can’t get to the door… I think he’s going
to try and take him himself.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: He couldn’t be that dumb. The guy’s a
trained killer. Bud’s idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over
laundry duty.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: I tool the liberty of removing this before I
gave it back to him.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Get the door!</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Safety’s on! On the side… the lever! Up,
push it up!</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Give me that!!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Forget that… go for Big Geek!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Gimme a hand!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Get the rest of my gear. Grab that hat there…
let’s go guys! Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Helmet… helmet! Work fast.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: I’ll unhook. GO! You’re better in these
than I am.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You owe me one, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Can we negotiate later? There’s Big Geek.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Go after it! We gotta catch it!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You did okay, back there. I was fairly
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big
Geek.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Not in this thing.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You totaled it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Yeah. So sue me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It’s flooding like a son of the bitch.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You noticed.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One,
over.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need
assistance, over. Deepcore, this–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Well, that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Wonderful. There’s some light from
somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Over there. It’s the rig.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Good hundred yards, I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: They’ll come out after us.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Yeah, but it’s gonna take them a while to find
us. We better get this flooding stopped.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You see where it’s coming in?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Can’t get to it. Have to pull this panel off.
You go any tools?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I don’t know, look around.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Nothing. Son of a bitch. All I need’s a goddamn
crescent wrench.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Calm down, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay… okay. We gotta get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I don’t know how!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We’ve only got one suit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I know! I know! But we better come up with
something.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Aaargh!! I’m freezing!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come
back with another suit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Seven, eight minute swim each way… not enough
time. Look at this… Time I get back you’ll be–</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Alright, put this on.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: What, you growing gills all of a sudden?
You got it on, keep it on.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Don’t argue, goddamnit, just–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No way! Forget it. Not an option.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you’re–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Listen… will you listen to me for a
second!? You’re for the suit on and you’re a better swimmer than me.
Right? So I got a plan…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I drown, you tow me back to the rig–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Look, this water is only a couple degrees
above freezing. I drown. I go into deep hypothermia… my blood like
icewater. I can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes. You got all
the stuff to do it on the rig.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: It is insane.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: It’s the only way, Bud. Now trust me.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Jesus, I don’t believe this is happening.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Oh God, Lins… I–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Tell me later.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: This is maybe not such a great plan, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hold me. Hold me, Bud… I’m so scared…</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: It’s Bud. Oh my God… that’s Lindsey!</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Read you, Bud. We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Go to the infirmary… get the cart .. oxygen…
de-fib kit… adrenaline in a… ten cc syringe… and some… heating blankets.
You got all that?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Got it. Over.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Turn her over!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Come on, hurry! Gimme the de-fib…</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Here, here, here… no, you got to have bare
skin, or it won’t…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Jesus. Gimme those, come on. Catfish, move it,
man! Come on… come on!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Is that it? Is this right?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Yeah! I mean, I don’t know… it looks
right.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: All right. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Do it again, One Night. Zap her again!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Aw. Christ… come on, baby. Again! Do it
again!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Come on, One Night… what are you waiting
for?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Bud, it’s over, man. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: No! NO! She’s not… her heart is strong, she
wants to live… can’t you see that? Come on, Lins. Come on, baby! Zap her
again! Do it… DO IT!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Come on, breath! Goddamn it, you bitch, you
never backed down from anything in life… now fight!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fight, Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Come on, Lins. You can do it… fight your way
back, baby…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You did it, ace.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hey… big boys don’t cry, remember?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hi, lady.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: ’Course is worked. You’re never wrong, are you?
How d’you feel.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I’ve been better. Next time it’s your turn,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Well, you got that right.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No, Bud, no… not you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who then?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: The fluid prevents your larynx from making
sound. It’ll feel a little strange.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Okay. Let’s rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Relax now, Bud. Just keep breathing as it
fills… don’t fight it. Take it in. Just let yourself take it in.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Hold him. Hold him. This is normal… it’ll pass
in a second. You’re gonna be okay. We all breathe liquid for nine
months, Bud. Your body will remember.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Can you hear me okay? Try your keypad.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I already have, moron.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: I redid Little Geek’s chip the same as Big
Geek! He should take you right to it. All you gotta do is hang on!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We’re right here with you, Bud. Your depth
is 3800 feet. You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: 4800 feet. It’s official.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a
record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn’t think you’d be doing
this when you got up this morning.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: One mile down and still grinnin’.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: 8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision
problems, euphoria.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Big baby.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: It’s starting. It hits the nervous system
first.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Keep talking, Lindsey. Just let him hear
your voice. It doesn’t matter what about.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Don’t forget Bud, you’re being graded on
spelling as well as sentence structure, so concentrate, okay? Bud, I…
uh, there’s some things I want to say. It’s hard for me. I’m not of
those softy, gooey- center-type people. It’s not easy, you know, being a
cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline and years of training. A lot of
people don’t appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: But is wasn’t all bad. I know that. You
remember that bike trip… we rode the Honda up through Oregon? It took me
a week to get my hair untangled, but I’ve never been happier. It was the
most… free… I’ve ever felt. I’m sorry I can’t tell you these things to
your face.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Two miles down and still grinnin’ Comin’ up
on the big ten thou’.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Bottom’s still a mile and a half
down.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: 12000 feet. Jesus, I don’t believe he’s doing
this.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Uh, oh…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: What kind of luminous things, Bud?</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Maybe it’s… you know… them.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: He’s losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with
us.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud, it’s the pressure. Try to concentrate.
Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I’m not going away, Bud. I’m right here,
right here with you. This is Lindsey, Bud. I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Signal’s fading.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: We’re losing juice… kill everything we don’t
need. Catfish, knock out those lights.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Run it through the digital processor,
cook it as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Seventeen thousand feet. Good Christ
Almighty, this is insane.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Little Geek just folded.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Bye, little buddy.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: He can still make it.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I know how alone you feel… alone in all
that cold blackness… but I’m there in the dark with you, Bud you’re not
alone…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You remember that time, you were pretty
drunk, you probably don’t remember… the power went out at the old
apartment, the one on Orange Street… and we were staring at that one
little candle, and I said something really dumb like that candle is me,
like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: … and you lit another candle and put it
beside</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: How you doin’, podner? Still with us,
come-back? Talk to us, Buddy boy.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Bud? You hangin’ in there? Talk to me, Bud.
Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: What kind of light?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: He’s hallucinating badly.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Okay, Bud, we’ll go step by step. Take the
cover plate off the firing box.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground
wire, not the lead wire…</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: It’s the blue wire with the white stripe, not…
I repeat… NOT the black wire with the yellow stripe.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Would we see the flash?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Through three miles of water? I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Quiet, quiet! Save you air, goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen
gauge.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: It took him over an hour to get down
there–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Drop you weights and start back now! The
gauge could be wrong…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No! You can make it! You hear me? Drop your
weights… you… can breathe shallow… you… it could be wrong–</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Oh God, Virgil, please…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Love you.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Howdy, Uuuh… how you guys doin’?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You watch out TV? That what you’re trying to
say? That you know what’s been going on up there?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … a Caltech scientist who is among
those</p>
<p><strong>berg</strong>: They’re acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis,
but with no seismological source. The waves are propagating toward the
shorelines of every continent–</p>
<p><strong>berg</strong>: Yeah. I’ll be right there… I have to go. Look,
we don’t know what it is! Okay? Not the slightest goddamn idea!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You’re doing it! Right? That’s what you’re
telling me. Yeah, you can control water… that’s your technology. But
why?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, you don’t know they’re really gonna do it.
Where do you get off passing judgment on us, when you can’t be sure? How
do you know?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The horizon has gone dark… the crowd is
starting to run… some are just staring, unable to move… the wave… the
wave is… it’s… I don’t know… maybe a thousand feet high already… getting
bigger as I’m watching… still miles out… oh my God, Jesus… I can hear
it…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Somebody just laid it down to us, man. Things
ain’t never gonna be the same!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Why? You could’ve done it. Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Deepcore, do you read? This is Benthic
Explorer, over.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Hell yes, we read! Good of you to join us.
How’s that storm doin’?</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Well, it’s strange… it just kind’ve blew
itself out all of the sudden. We’re up here in a flat sea with no wind.
But then a lot of weird things’ve been happening.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Well, hell, son. You better get us a line
down here, we’re in moderately poor shape.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: They figure is was over a half mile
high.</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: I wish I could have seen it–</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Hey. Hey! HEY!! Look… it’s Bud.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: It says…</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: I’d say that’s a big 10-4, jack.</p>
<p><strong>mcbride</strong>: Looks like you boys might by out of
business.</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: Something’s going on down there. I’m getting
some big readings….</p>
<p><strong>one night</strong>: Whew! Whatever this is, it’s major.</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: Active is pinging back something big… it’s
enormous! Coming up right under us.</p>
<p><strong>demarco</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: Where? EVERYWHERE!! Over there! Port
bow.</p>
<p><strong>bendix</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: We should be dead. We didn’t
decompress.</p>
<p><strong>catfish</strong>: Out blood oughta be fizzin’ like a warm,
shook- up Coke.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: They must’ve done something to us.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Oh, yes. I think you could say that.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hello, Brigman.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Brigman.</p>
