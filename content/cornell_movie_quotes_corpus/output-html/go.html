<p><strong>go</strong>: written by John August</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know what I like best about Christmas?
The surprises.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s like, you get this box, and you’re sure
you know what’s in it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You shake it, you weigh it, and you’re
totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m not saying this is anything it’s not.
But c’mon. This time yesterday, who’dda thunk it?</p>
<p><strong>`x’</strong>: Christmas MUZAK plays. A baby CRIES.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Paper or plastic?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Paper or plastic?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Paper or plastic?</p>
<p><strong>stringy haired woman</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>stringy haired woman</strong>: You didn’t double my
coupons.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: They’re at the bottom. In red. Where it says,
double coupons.</p>
<p><strong>stringy haired woman</strong>: You can’t do that. You can’t
put bleach in the same bag as food. It’s poison.</p>
<p><strong>stringy haired woman</strong>: Don’t think you’re something
you’re not. I used to have your job.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Look how far it got you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She’s been on for fourteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ronna?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I haven’t asked you yet.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Answer’s still no.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are you menstrual? Pre-menstrual, post-
menstrual?</p>
<p><strong>4a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: One of the three. Okay, Simon. In case you
haven’t heard the buzz, the scoop, the word on the street, I’m getting
evicted. Tomorrow. So pardon me if I’m not in a holly-jolly mood right
now.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ronna, they wouldn’t evict you at Christmas.
You’d be ho-ho-homeless.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Is that why all the overtime? How much do you
owe?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Three eighty.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: More than I got.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ll give you twenty right now for a
blowjob.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Handjob?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ronna, do you want my shift?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Serious?</p>
<p><strong>4b.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I haven’t punched in yet.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Look, my best mates are going to Las Vegas
this weekend. I’ve never been – I’m told it’s incredible. If you took my
shift, I could go with them. Everybody wins. Cash up front.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ronna? Are you certain I couldn’t have a
blowjob?</p>
<p><strong>voice on intercom</strong>: Available cashier to the front.
Customers waiting.</p>
<p><strong>voice on intercom</strong>: Repeat, cashier to the front.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: One of us has to go.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Dead celebrities?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Loser goes up. Steve McQueen.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Michael Landon.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Lucille Ball.</p>
<p><strong>6a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Burt Lancaster. Can you drive?</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: If you don’t mind The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I love The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Lane Staley. Alice in Chains.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: He’s not dead yet.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Lewis Carroll. Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Carole Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Lee Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Don’t say Molly Ringwald.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Martha Raye.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Nice. Robert Mitchum.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Shit! M. M. MMMMMMMMalcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You can’t say Malcolm X.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: He’s famous, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: That’s like a rule or something. Nothing
starts with X.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: That’s not my problem.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: You can challenge.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Okay, I challenge. Give me one dead
celebrity that starts with X.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: This is bullshit. I am not working the
fucking register.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: X…X…There is one. I know I thought of one
before.</p>
<p><strong>switterman</strong>: Break was over four minutes ago. Who’s
up front?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Xerxes.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with
X.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: That wasn’t it. I never heard of fucking
“Xerxes.”</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Pharaoh coulda saved your ass.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There’s an opera about him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Xerxes. I took music appreciation twice.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Does a British guy still work here?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: He went to Vegas for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Betcha wonder why we’re buying all this orange
juice.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Scurvy?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Say… Ronna. You don’t know where we could get
something to go with this orange juice, do you?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Doughnuts, aisle four.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: But then you get the weird taste in your
mouth. I was thinking something a little more euphoric. The British guy
usually hooks us up.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Twenty at twenty.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You’re overpaying.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We’re desperate. A bunch of us are going to
this party tonight, this warehouse thing…</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Mary Xmas Supafest.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re going?</p>
<p><strong>9a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: And we had planned this kinda pre-party. Only
there’s 20 of us, it’s like all or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: A friend was supposed to get the stuff in
Chicago, but now he’s snowed in. So if you could help us out here…</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Gimme a number. Let me see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Kick ass.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: So do you want the o.j. or not?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know that Simon’s in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I don’t need Simon. I’m going to Todd.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Todd GAINES?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Who’s Todd Gaines?</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Simon’s dealer.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You can’t do that, can you? I mean, go
around Simon.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Ok, listen up. If Simon were here – which
he’s not – he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten.</p>
<p><strong>10a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>11 continued: 11</strong>: RONNA</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: But it’s like an evolutionary leap. You’re
moving up the drug food chain. Without permission.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ronna, you shouldn’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Both of you chill the fuck out. It’s just
once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it
makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back
and watch.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Speak!</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Todd! It’s Ronna Martin. You know me through
Simon.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Can I come up?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Todd?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Don’t let the cat out.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I didn’t wake you up, did I?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: I thought you were still buying quarters off
Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I keep him honest.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: At that level you’re supposed to pinch. It’s
the economics of it.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: You leaving?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Be good.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: I take it this is not a social call.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: A favor? Wow. I didn’t know we were such
good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head
before I give favors. I don’t even give my best friends head, so the
chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. You
might try just telling me what you want to buy.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Twenty hits of ecstacy.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: You come here out of the blue asking for
twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to
sell becomes trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Todd, I would never fuck you like that.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: How would you fuck me? Would you strap it
on?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: What’s the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: There’s this big Christmas party thing.
Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party
thing.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Friends of yours. You’re not going to go and
try to sell this on me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: You’re not dealing.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical
grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. Don’t let anyone double dose
or you’ll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. One hit per
headbanger.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Understood.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Twenty at fifteen is 300.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: You already did strap it on.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: It’s just that I know you charge Simon
ten.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Inflation’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Here’s the deal. There’s 20 of us. I need all
of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that’s all I have.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like a
downpayment. You give me the stuff, I get the extra hundred from them,
then I come right back and pay you.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: See, that would be doing you a favor, and
you know how I feel about favors.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I could leave something with you.
Collateral.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: I already got a fucking Swatch. I need
something I know you’ll come back for.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Claire, could you come up with me for a
sec?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have
to sit there.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hello! He’s a drug dealer.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Jesus, Claire. Don’t get 818 on me here. How
much shit have I done for you? This is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No. No! You’re making me an accessory.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Claire. That bracelet of mine you’re wearing
is an accessory. You are just some chick who’s sitting in an apartment.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don’t get
this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You could…</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: No, Claire. I don’t have anyone else to go
to. I am coming to you and I am asking for your help. Please. Help
me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Forty-five minutes. That’s like eight
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: We’ll be back by eight, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for
directions.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Ronna!</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: You’re a pro.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I’m a top-seeded amateur.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: And I’m a very happy man.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Damn good to meet you, Rhonda.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Ronna.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I
thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Work work work. Friday must be a busy
night.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: That was just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hey. What can I get you to drink?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Some of that orange juice would be great.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: So this party tonight sounds like it’s gonna
be huge.</p>
<p><strong>18a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Massive.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That would be a synonym for huge.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Just backing you up.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: And I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Ronna hun, we are fresh out of o.j…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cerveza?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
orange juice. It’s in the car.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You got a bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Down the hall on the right.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Let me show you…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Maybe we could do this first.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>19a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe she didn’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Just wait here. Keep it calm.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Ronna locks the door.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You’re fine. You’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Everything all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: The handle, rocking back and forth, locked.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>cu</strong>: The hole in the center of the door knob. A thin
allen wrench slips in.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: All yours.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Ronna, hun, do we got a deal here or not?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: No. No, see we don’t. That’s what I came here
to tell you. I couldn’t get anything.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: C’mon, resourceful girl like you? I don’t
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I just want to make a deal here, Ronna. Can
we make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Who the fuck are you? Monty Hall?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Did you know I’m only 17?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I probably shouldn’t be drinking this beer,
should I? Being so underage and all.</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: Man, I don’t know what happened, it’s like the
machine just ate the tape.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I think it was Simon they were after. He
deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the
fucking register.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: They didn’t know who was dealing, just that
it was someone at the store?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: They were fishing. I bit.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: It’s Claire. She paged me while I was in
there.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn’t
show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: They’re gone. I flushed them.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or
20 hits of X.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You took one, didn’t you? Fuck you, Mannie!
How could you do this to me? I need you now.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Just drive. I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>a crappy cd player</strong>: |</p>
<p><strong>tm</strong>: The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg
stare…</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Were they round or oval?</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: Round. White. Like aspirin. Like baby
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: A or B?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>mannie</strong>: I wasn’t really looking.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Stop fucking paging me, Claire!</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Speak!…Just licking my dick, whazzup with
you?…Yeah…The Crazy Horse, you’ll have to look it up…I don’t know what
I’m up to. Where’s this party at?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: It’s called “Mary Xmas.” Mary like a
chick…Like her name is Mary, not like you marry her. You fucking moron…I
dunno, some warehouse shit. Is this gonna be cool?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: My friend Claire here says it’s going to be
a kick-ass-fucking-time…What, you know her? It’s your buddy Simon. He’s
in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: She knows…Hell, I dunno… Maybe…Yeah, well
save a load for me big boy…Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: What do you want for Christmas, Claire?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Do you want to get laid?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: No, you don’t wanna get laid or no, you do,
but you don’t want to get laid with me?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You can’t answer that. I mean, it’s
like…</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Either way you’re fucked. Where are they,
Claire?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: They’ll be here. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Are you a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: C’mon, Claire. Answer the question. Answer
the question, Claire.</p>

stoned.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: That’s no problem. These things happen, I
understand that.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Todd, I’m trying to explain what happened.
They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of
miscommunication, I thought…</p>

short, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Hi. I’m Kelly, and this is Donna. We were
wondering if you might want to hang out.</p>
<p><strong>fila guy</strong>: I think I feel something.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: It’s really smooth, isn’t it? Donna’s brother
is a pharmacist. He got it for us.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Chip. His name is Chip. My brother.</p>
<p><strong>nike hat</strong>: Is it like a wave, or is it like a
zoom?</p>
<p><strong>fila guy</strong>: It’s like floating. Like, “Hey down there,
how’s the ground and shit.”</p>
<p><strong>nike hat</strong>: I got it. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>anorexic girl</strong>: Is it really that cool?</p>
<p><strong>fila guy</strong>: You gotta try it. Shit, I’ll buy for
you.</p>

you smoke a lot of pot. I mean a lot of it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I can’t believe you are selling allergy
medicine.</p>

here. I’m going to get the car and come back for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I can’t carry you! Mannie, just hide here.
Just like a little mouse, okay? You’re going to be fine. Ain’t nobody
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: How’s it going, Ronna? How are sales?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Todd, I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: I’m not going to ask you to.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: The thing is, it’s not like I’m in a highly
ethical industry. But goddamn, Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy
hits.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: It’s not what it looks like. I mean, it sort
of is, but it’s complicated.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I know I fucked up, but I can make it up to
you. Please, Todd.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: I’m the last fucking person you should be
expecting a favor from.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: I have the cash. I have more than I owe
you.</p>
<p><strong>gaines</strong>: So now you’re an entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Mannie!!</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the fuck
it was! Perry Farrell’s dead girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A. Fuck, I
knew there was one.</p>

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dude, you passed out before we left L.A.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Pop! Goes the asshole.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: So this chick, she’s bobbing up and down on my
dick like she’s fucking Marilyn Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: She actually found your dick?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Then she starts going around the ouside– you
know, painting the tree–when WHACK! It hits her in the eye. And her
contact, it’s like stuck on my dick.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Her contact lens. It’s stuck on the end of my
dick.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Was it hard or soft?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: What, my dick?</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: The contact lens.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Do you remember if it was a colored lens?
That she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one
brown?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: What the fuck does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It matters because it happened to me. It was
my story. I told this story about a year ago. The difference was, I knew
those small-but-important details. That, and it was true.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Oh. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Whatever?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Yo, pull your stinky dinky out of my ass. I
was just trying to make conversation. Fuck. Give a nigger a break.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What nigger? This nigger?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: My mother’s mother’s mother was black.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So you say, yet we have never seen a picture
of this Ebonic woman.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: Stop. Truce.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: If you were any less black, you would be
clear.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Look at your skin.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: I see black because I know I am. Color is a
state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thank you Rhythm Nation.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So what does Valentina do?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She’s a nutritionist. She also teaches a
class at this college.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What class?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Tantric sexuality for couples.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: She teaches people how to fuck?</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Man, I taught myself.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You shouldn’t eat shrimp. It’s loaded with
iodine.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: This shit is expensive. You’re paying five
bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thing is, most people really don’t know how
to make love. They just put it in and move it around until they get off.
What tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience,
bring it to a higher level. If one man in ten were having the sex I’m
having, there would be no war.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s the longest you and her ever did
it?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fourteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: How many times you shoot?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Not once.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fourteen hours, you didn’t go once. Not even
at the end?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You redirect the orgasm inside.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Swear to God. And I do mean Allah.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: When was the last time you got off? I mean
like, wet.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I haven’t ejaculated in six months.</p>
<p><strong>tiny</strong>: Six months!</p>

discipline.</p>

motherfucker.</p>

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Todd Gaines. The drug dealer.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: He gets a discount. He let me use it. He’s a
good guy.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: He’s the good drug dealer. I get
confused.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We’ll pay cash anyway. This is just to get
the room.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Could you answer a question… …Rachel?
Hypothetically, do you think a man could make love to a woman for 14
hours without ever achieving climax?</p>
<p><strong>desk woman</strong>: I think my manager would be better able
to answer that question. Would you like me to call him over?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>desk woman</strong>: Great then. Welcome to the Riviera.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp?</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: I have something for you. Where did I put it?
Oh, it’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Todd, it’s Simon. What’s up?…I’m in Vegas, we
just got here. What was the name of the place you said we should go…The
Crazy Horse. What are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You’re going to a wedding?…What is it, a
rave?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, I know Claire…Are you going to fuck
her?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This is our room.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Oh. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Raping small children.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did I mention how much I like your
jacket?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There’s a reason.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Let me borrow some money.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where’s your money?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I lost it</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We’ve been here five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I was playing this game at a hundred dollar
table and I didn’t understand it, but now I do. I think I figured out
how to beat it.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Let me see your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You can have it back in an hour. No, no. No
buts. One hour, right here.</p>
<p><strong>various shots</strong>: Simon wanders, bored. He hits on a
WOMAN at the nickel slots. When she rebuffs him, he turns his attention
to the COCKTAIL WAITRESS.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Okay, if you’re from over there, then where
did you meet these friends? Of yours. Who I don’t see.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: They already knew each utter, but Marcus I
met in traffic school.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Een traffic skewl?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m a good driver, I am. I learned everything
from American television. Hunter, Magnum P.I. – The Knight Rider is an
excellent program.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Do you want to be getting high with us?</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Otherwise, I can’t hold it in.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You’re fine. You’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Tell her she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Did you go?</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Tantra, baby.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I am not a bathroom attendant!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey. We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Fuck yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ferrari man</strong>: Keep it close and there’s an extra ten
bucks for you.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Get in. Get in the car. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Question. When you’re doing tantra, you hold
it in at the end, right?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you
never hold it in. Haven’t you ever gotten blue balls? Hurts like a
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sort of a dull ache.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: See if there’s a map.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Orange County.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Don’t point it at me!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How do I know if it’s loaded?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: First, you stop pointing it at me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Floor. Floor!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ve never held a real gun before. It’s
heavier than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Great, put it back.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I want to know if it’s loaded. How do</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hold the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I hold ten men’s lives in my hand.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s a nine millimeter. It doesn’t have
stopping power.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Right. For that you’d need Magnum Force.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: This is why I came here. This is America. I’m
serious. You want to take one symbol for all of America, it’s not the
flag or the hawk…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: …eagle…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: …or the automobile. America is about a man
and a gun.</p>

buy a bottle of champagne. You don’t, but don’t say that right off.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Explain.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Champagne means you want a private dance.
You can’t afford it, neither can I. But if they know we’re not biting,
they don’t even dangle the bait.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: So, “champagne” is a code. What does vodka
mean?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We have one word, champagne. You can order
anything you want, anything, as long as it’s not champagne.</p>

champagne.</p>

stop kicking him.</p>

<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Get the gun. Go. Find it.</p>

<p><strong>burke</strong>: So, Zack. What does your girlfriend look
like?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: About five-eight, brown hair, blue eyes.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hot.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: She faithful?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You faithful?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Zack’s girlfriend is fucking around on
him.</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: Man, I’m sorry. How did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: It’s no big…I don’t really want to get into
it.</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: C’mon, tell us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Absolutely. Tell us.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I found socks.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What, red socks, blue socks?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: White socks. You know how the good kind of
socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out?
When I moved in, every one of the socks had that. Suddenly, there was
one sock that didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You hear that? We got John Sherlock Holmes in
the car here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Alright. But you’ve been fucking around,
too.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Only after I found out.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So, Zack. Do you know who your girlfriend’s
fucking?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions. Mostly
former boyfriends who keep calling.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What a coincidence. I have the exact same
problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I think she’s been sleeping around
on me, too.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Isn’t it ironic.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t you think? Maybe I should start checking
for socks, too.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Gay men are so hot. It’s tragic.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He’s not here. What are we supposed to do?
He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We’re going to ask. You’re going to ask.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You look more wholesome. Just improv.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Nobody. I’m giving you an opening.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He wasn’t there. The British guy, he wasn’t
there.</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: No, we heard. You guys did great.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: This chick… Ronna. You think she can
score?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Then that’s all we need. It’s all connected.
The circle of life.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now they’re both going. What’s up with
that?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: So if she gets the stuff, what, you arrest
her?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We try to bring her over. See, we arrest her
and then what? One crack whore off the street. So we cut her a deal. She
helps us get this guy. We cut him a deal. He helps us get the guy above
him. It’s just like what happened with you.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: So, sooner or later, everybody’s working for
The Man.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>84a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: She’s coming up.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What if she isn’t really a dealer though? If
you just pulled her into this one thing, wouldn’t that be
entrapment?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: If she’s making this deal, she’s a dealer.
Doesn’t matter if its her first or her last.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cerveza?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
orange juice. It’s in the car.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>ronna</strong>: You got a bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Down the hall on the right.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Let me show you…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now watch what I do with his wrist. I twist
it away while I put on the second cuff. That way he can’t go after me.
He doesn’t have any leverage.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I watch all these cop shows and they never do
it right. Pisses me off.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hey, feel the abs on this one.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You could scrub laundry on these.</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: Full hands.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loop</strong>: Nothing. I’m out of it. Merry Christmas, guys.
Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>86a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We’re done, now, right? That’s what we talked
about. Whether or not the deal went through, we just had to do our
part.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You did your part.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Great. Well, hey. A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now that he’s gone, there’s something I
wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a proposition. See, my wife and I
– Irene, she’s my wife – we’re both working on Christmas so we’re gonna
have Christmas dinner tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you guys would
want to come over, eat some dinner with us. My wife is great, you’ll
love her, then I’ll sign your form. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Actually, you know, I had plans.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: With your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yes, Adam, in fact. With my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Huh. Wow, I can’t believe I forgot this. I saw
your girlfriend this morning, and she asked me to tell you that she
couldn’t make your plans tonight.</p>
<p><strong>87a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It looks like we’re both free.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Yes? Hi?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They’re singing Christmas carols. My family.
Minnesota, they do that.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: No, stay for a sec.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Smell this. What does it smell like?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: CK One. But it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I get this for a quarter what that stuff
costs.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s down. So is the liner.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: It is soft.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Get on.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Exactly. Individually wrapped springs. Top
quality.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I could be doing aerobics over here and you
wouldn’t feel it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I sure wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: So, Zack. Would you say you’re open to new
things?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Of course you like your job. You get to kiss
all those pretty girls.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It does have perks.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Tell me something. When you kiss those girls,
you’re not really kissing them, are you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but
there’s no tongue.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: There’s no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s acting. It’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: See, now, that. There was a tongue there.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Honey, red or white?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What goes with turkey?</p>
<p><strong>adam and zack</strong>: White.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: More wine?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No. He doesn’t want any more. Unless he does,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: This has been great, just wonderful, but we’re
going to need to leave. Soon. Adam’s not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not. It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: If you gotta go, then I understand. But Irene
and I sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: He makes it sound sinister. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: She’s right. Okay, you’ve looked around our
place. Where do you think we got most of this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Just guess.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sears?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: J.C. Penney’s?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s actually from Confederated Products.
Almost everything in this house is from Confederated Products, from the
toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: The wine.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Even that cologne you liked. See,
Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That
means we don’t just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and
manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and
we’re already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: We’re the number four distributor in Southern
California. By March, we might be number three.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I
can’t recruit distributors from inside the force. It’s against the rules
and we’d get fired. So what we do is look for people in other
industries…</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: …like the entertainment industry.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Wait. You want us to sell Amway.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Confederated Products. It’s a different
company, different quality of product.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I need to do something terrifically
unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: With me, or one of your other boyfriends?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I have cheated on you with exactly one
guy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ditto.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and
it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not
up for it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ll tell you mine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You can’t wait to tell me, can you? You’re
gloating. You think yours is better than mine.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Sean Connery, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Count of three.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Alright. Sure. Wait. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Jimmy. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is Jimmy here?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Oh my God. Oh. My God.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’ll call you back. Jimmy’s not here. He
went to this thing. Let me find it.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You do know, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I take no responsibilty. I was only an
innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by
three minutes. It was so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s some sort of rave thing.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Mary Xmas Supafest.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He left an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You’re not going to kill him, are you? The
little shit owes me rent.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Okay, I just have to say this. The thing is,
about Jimmy, he wasn’t even that good.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God.
It was like having sex with Nell.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were
beaching themselves.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips.
That’s really not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: The only thing I will give him credit for is
the oral.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you mean? He was terrible. At some
point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had
to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: October, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Early October. And he suddenly got so much
better.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That is so disturbing. It’s like you were
there.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Right. This right. This right! That was the
right you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s…It’s that girl.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Ronna.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Go. Go. Go!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What if she’s…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Let’s think about it logically. Either she’s
alive, or she’s dead. If she’s dead, then there’s nothing we can do. If
she’s alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her,
probably did shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So even if she’s alive, she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: On the plus side, the only witnesses are you,
me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So
if you really think about it, it didn’t turn out as badly as it could
have.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: A girl is dead.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I didn’t say it went perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: 911 Emergen…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Holy sh…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: They wouldn’t have been listening all this
time.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello, they could have been recording it.
Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did
it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What if we were just running lines? For a
scene?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: There’s a pretty good chance no one’s found
her yet.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They will.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No. Listen. If there’s no body, there’s no
crime.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Stop. Okay, stop!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: It’s a Miata.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We’ll put her in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where will I…Or you…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: In the passenger seat. Holding her up.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Little help?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Okay, listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: She’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s dead. I hit her and I killed her.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No you didn’t, okay? This is all just
make-believe. This is a scene. She’s just acting dead. And you’re just
acting scared.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: See, there’s the lights, and there’s the
camera. Watch your blocking. There’s Michelle in wardrobe, say “Hi,
Michelle!”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi, Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: The craft service truck is right around the
corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. And
you can have one if you just help me finish this scene. Can you smell
them? Can you smell them on the grill?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not delusional.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Then take her fucking arms!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No shit!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If she’s not dead, that means we didn’t kill
her. We can just leave her.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: She’s almost dead. We leave her and she dies,
why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you mean, I killed her?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Christ, I didn’t mean it that way. C’mon. I
would never testify against you.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: We have to stick with Plan A.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In Plan A she was dead.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Okay. New plan.</p>
<p><strong>car alarm voice</strong>: Back away from the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>fila guy</strong>: Hey, it’s Kelly. Somebody beat the crap
out of her.</p>
<p><strong>skate-punk guy</strong>: Somebody call an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Look, she’s fine. They’re getting an
ambulance. She’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He
could still go after her.</p>
<p><strong>104a.</strong>: “GO” 8/26/98 Revisions</p>

problem. Girl out of ditch – that’s her own problem. We’re done. We did
the right thing.</p>

half-assed, thrown-together fashion.</p>

what’s in it. You shake it, you weigh it, and you’re totally convinced
you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. But then you open it up, and
it’s something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean,

want Sunset Boulevard, not Sunset Drive.</p>

<p><strong>jimmy shubert</strong>: Somethin’ about it just didn’t add
up. So last night I went back to the pier to do some investigating of my
own. Turns out there are two boats named the Princess. Only, one just
got back from two weeks at sea – Sal Dominico’s boat. It got me thinkin’
– if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn’t tell
Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by
himself? And why would you still have his briefcase? Answer me that,
Danielle. If you have an answer.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m not the man you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We both know you were on the pier. You saw
what happened to Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Don’t forget, detective. I was cleared of all
charges.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t care how many high-priced lawyers you
bring in. Eden Valley will never stand for your kind of scum.</p>
