<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
I’d see –</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I think he’s in a conference.
Unfortunately. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Would you just try him? You never know.
As long as I’m here. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Of course. Please have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: It’s her – I know, but couldn’t you
just – Yes, I know, but – I know, but she’s old and it would be a nice –
Yes, sorry. I’m sorry, ma’am, he’s not in right now. It’s a crazy time
of year for us.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: This book – It’s essential that people
read it because – – It’s the truth. And only I know it.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Maybe after the holidays then.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah, hi, I have a one o’clock with
Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, please have a seat. He’ll be right with
you.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Howard, your one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Order me a pastrami for after?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Cole slaw, ice tea?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Welcome, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Boo.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Stan… c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Sorry. I just –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s just…y’know… I mean…</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I know. Anyway –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Anyway, I’ve got to do my tap dance here.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: See you later, alligator.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ’kay.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hey, if you’re ordering lunch for Mierzwiak,
would you –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I better do this, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ms. Kruczynski?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Well, why don’t you tell me what’s going
on? Do you mind if I turn this on?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, I’ve been having a bad time of it
with um, my boyfriend, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: You guess he’s your boyfriend? Or you
guess you’re having a bad time with hm?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What? No. I don’t like the term
boyfriend. It’s so gay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Maybe gay isn’t the right word. But,
anyway, it’s been rough with him… whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My
significant other… heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to
break it off, but I feel… y’know… it’s like this constant questioning
and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I’m not
happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the
drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I’m not getting any
younger, I want to have a baby… at some point… maybe… right? So then I
think I should settle – which is not necessarily the best word – I mean,
he’s a good guy. It’s not really settling. Then I think maybe I’m just a
victim of movies, y’know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion
of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I
really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking
find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and… It’s
complicated. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I think I know. I think we can help. Why
don’t you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you
can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we’ll take
it from there.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Um, well, he’s a fucking tidy one –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I’m not feeling well
this morning. No. Food poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me so long to
call in, but I’ve been vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work and
took the train out to Montauk. It’s cold. The sky is gray. I don’t know
what else to say. Nothing happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi last
night. We had sex. It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life
so easily. Like no time has passed. After two years apart suddenly we’re
talking about getting together again. I guess that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: If I’m constitutionally incapable of making
eye-contact with a woman I don’t know. I guess I’d better get back to
Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: God, yes. You’ve saved my life!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You know what you want yet?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Ain’t that the question of the
century.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You got grilled cheese and tomato
soup?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Yeah. We’re having a run on it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: And some cream, please.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Why what?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Why are you sorry? I just said hi.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I didn’t know if you were talking to me,
so…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I didn’t want to assume.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Aw, c’mon, live dangerously. Take the
leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Anyway. Sorry. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s okay if I sit closer? So I don’t
have to scream. Not that I don’t need to scream sometimes, believe me.
But I don’t want to bug you if you’re trying to write or something.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I mean, I don’t know. I can’t really think
of much to say probably.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh. So…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I mean, it’s okay if you want to sit down
here. I didn’t mean to –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, I don’t want to bug you if you’re
trying to –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s okay, really.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
I have a long trip ahead of me. How far are you going? On the train, I
mean, of course.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Rockville Center.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Get out! Me too! What are the odds?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: The weirder part is I think actually I
recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That’s why I was
looking at you. You work at Borders, right?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Ucch, really? You’re kidding. God.
Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that’s me: book slave there for, like,
five years now.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Really? Because –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit
right now.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: – because I go there all the time. I don’t
think I ever saw you before.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, I’m there. I hide in the back as
much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right
this minute. I’ll call in dead.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’ll go on the dole. Like my daddy
before me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I noticed your hair. I guess it made an
impression on me, that’s why I was pretty sure I recognized you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It’s called
Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
wondering.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah. Tom Waits says it in –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green
Revolution. That’d be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get
a job like that? That’s what I’ll do. Fuck the dole.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t really know how –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You think that could possibly be a full time
job? How many hair colors could there be?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Someone’s got that job. Agent Orange! I
came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and
I’d be great at it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sure you would.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: My writing career! Your hair written by
Clementine Kruczynski. The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You sure? That doesn’t sound –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I think. Anyway, I’ve tried all their
colors. More than once. I’m getting too old for this. But it keeps me
from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in
a paste. You?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, I doubt that’s the case.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, you don’t know me, so… you don’t
know, do you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: My name’s Clementine, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m Joel.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn’t
do that; you’re trying to be nice.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know any jokes about your name.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Huckleberry Hound?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Huckleberry Hound! What, are you
nuts?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m nut nuts.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh my darlin’, oh my darlin’, oh my
darlin’ Clementine? No?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sorry. It’s a pretty name, though. It means
“merciful”, right?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I’m a
vindictive little bitch, truth be told.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: See, I wouldn’t think that about you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Why wouldn’t you think that about
me?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh. I don’t know. I was just… I don’t know. I
was… You seemed nice, so –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Now I’m nice? Don’t you know any other
adjectives? There’s careless and snotty and overbearing and
argumentative… mumpish.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, anyway… Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I just don’t think “nice” is a
particularly interesting thing to be.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Tickets.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides an
adjective? I guess it can be an adverb, sort of.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It doesn’t reveal anything. Nice is
pandering. Cowardly.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: And life is more interesting than that.
Or should be. Jesus God, I hope it is… someday. I know it’s here.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t need nice. I don’t need myself
to be it and I don’t need anyone else to be it at me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Shit. Shit. I know it’s here. Hold
on.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Damn it. DAMN IT! Oh. Here.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Next stop Southampton.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel? It’s Joel, right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m sorry I… yelled at you. Was it
yelling? I can’t really tell. Whatever, I’m a little out of sorts
today.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: My embarrassing admission is I really
like that you’re nice. Right now, anyway. I can’t tell from one moment
to the next what I’m going to like. But right now I’m glad you said,
“that’s okay” to me. That was nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I
need to –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh, okay. Well, sure, I’ll just… Take
care, then.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Probably see you at the book store.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Unless I get that hair-color-naming
job.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, that’s okay. Thanks, though.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re sure? It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t want to take you out of your
way.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re not a stalker or anything,
right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I probably wouldn’t say if I were, but
no.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You can’t be too careful. I’ve been
stalked. I’ve been told I’m highly stalkable. I don’t need that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m not a stalker.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You know Wilmont?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Wilmont. Near the high school.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Look, I’m very sorry I came off sort of
nutso. I’m not really.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s okay. I didn’t think you were.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: So you like bookstores, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I like to read.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah? I can’t remember that album very well. I
remember liking it. But –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: The song’s 9th and Hennepin. I spent
most of the train ride trying to remember. “Till you’re full of rag
water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to
anyone who’ll listen.” Remember?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sort of, um…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Remember? “And you take on the dreams of
the ones who have slept there/And I’m lost in the window/I hide on the
stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat…” Oh, shit. I’m so
stupid. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m just a bit of a wreck. “I sleep in
your hat” makes me cry. Me.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Thanks very much. That was very nice of
you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t want to be –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh, geez, I’m full of shit. I already
told you that. Anyway. See Ya.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have
lots of drinks. And I could –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Um –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I’m
embarrassed. Good night, Joel.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Thanks. I like it, too. Been here about
four years. It’s really cheap. My downstairs neighbor is old so she’s
quiet, which is great. And the landlord’s sweet, which is bizarre, but
great, and I have a little porch in the back, which is great, because I
can read there, and listen to my crickets and…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Two blue ruins…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You like that?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: This… someone gave that to me, just
like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a
crow.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Do you believe in that stuff?
Reincarnation?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Me neither. Oh, there’s an inscription
on the back. The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a
hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of
a day I rued.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Frost?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah. I’m not, like, a Robert Frost
lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But
this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school.
Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I miss grade school. I don’t know why
I’m calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it
elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something
someone from the forties would call it. I’d like to be from then.
Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: God, that feels so fucking good. Take
yours off.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Ready for another?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, I’m okay for now.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, I’m ready. Put some music on.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What do you want to hear?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You pick it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You just say. I’m not really –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t know! I can’t see them from
here, Joel! Just pick something good.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh, excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Mmmmmmm. Way to go, Joel. You pick
good.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, I should probably get going.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, stay. Just for a little while.
Refill?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. I –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I know a man who needs a refill.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: God bless alcohol, is what I say. Where
would I be without it. Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I don’t want
to think about that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Drink up, young man. It’ll make the
whole seduction part less repugnant.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m just kidding. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Y’know, I’m sort of psychic.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, I go to a psychic and she’s always
telling me I’m psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Me neither. But sometimes I have
premonitions, so, I don’t know. Maybe that’s just coincidence. Right?
Y’know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and
then someone says it? Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I don’t know. It’s hard to know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Exactly. Exactly! That’s exactly my
feeling about it. It’s hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I
think something and it doesn’t happen? That’s what you’re saying, right?
You forget about those times. Right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: But I think I am. I like to think I
am.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s helpful to think there’s some order
to things. You’re kind of closed mouthed, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sorry. My life isn’t that interesting. I go to
work. I go home. I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh. Does that make you sad? Or anxious?
I’m always anxious thinking I’m not living my life to the fullest,
y’know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I’m
not wasting one second of the little time I have.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think about that.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re really nice. I’m sorry I yelled
at you before about it. God, I’m an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I do have a tendency to use that word too
much.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I like you. That’s the thing about my
psychic thing. I think that’s my greatest psychic power, that I get a
sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And
with you I get that you’re a really good guy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I
can tell. There’s a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My
goal… can I tell you my goal?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What’s the goal, Joel? My goal, Joel, is
to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It’s like,
there’s all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change
and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we’re
all taught we should be consistent. Y’know? You love someone – that’s
it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life – that’s it,
that’s what you do. It’s a sign of maturity to stick with that and see
things through. And my feeling is that’s how you die, because you stop
listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You
know?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah. I think so. It’s hard to –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn’t
need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might
exist?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re very nice. God, I have to stop
saying that. You’re nervous around me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m nervous. You don’t need to be
nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I’m repulsively
fat?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t either. I used to. But I’m
through with that. Y’know, if I don’t love my body, then I’m just lost.
You know?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: With all the wrinkles and scars and the
general falling apart that’s coming ’round the bend. So, I’ve been
seeing this guy…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, for the last week, anyway! He’s
kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he’s really stuck on me, which is
flattering. Who wouldn’t like that? And he’s, like, a dope, but he says
these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break
my heart. He’s the one who gave me that crow photograph.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: That made me cry. But, anyway, we went
up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles
River. It gets frozen this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s scary sounding.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Exactly! I used to do it in college and
I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all
night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I
was really disappointment to be there with him. Y’know? And that’s where
psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn’t right with him. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t believe in that soulmate crap
anymore, but… he says so many great things. We like the same writers.
This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he’s cute. It’s fucked
up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah? Oh, great!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’ll pack a picnic – a night picnic –
night picnics are different – and –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sounds good. But right now I should go.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You should stay.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I have to get up early in the morning
tomorrow, so…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I would like you to call me. Would you
do that? I would like that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t think your personality comes out of a
tube. I think the hair is just… a pretty topping.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So, I enjoyed meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’ll call me, right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Tonight. Just to test out the phone
lines and all.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Them.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It was snowing.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: There are two of them. Couldn’t make
them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: The driver waved. So casual, friendly.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I’m like a joke to them.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I guess they figure they can act like
they want. They don’t have to worry about me remembering.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I might be making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Maybe I’m making a mistake. Maybe I just
need to learn to live with this. First of all, I’ll get over it.
Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned
to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I’m not sure. But I don’t care.
She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Fuck you, Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Pink. There was a number on it. I
remember.</p>
<p><strong>al 1718?</strong>: I have to follow through with this. I have
no choice.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: The pill was pink, I remember. It had
some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something.
Four digits. I don’t like taking pills when I don’t know what they are.
I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: We’re sorry, the number you have dialed… Screw
you, Clementine, for doing this …</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: We’re sorry, the number you have
dialed is no longer in service. If you think you have reached this
recording in error -</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s them.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: It’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I should maybe talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Clementine. I should just maybe talk to
her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I love you and if you knew that… if I told you
what happened… I’ll explain everything, what we meant to each other.
I’ll tell you everything about our time together. You’ll know everything
again and…</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
wouldn’t have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it
would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again
and…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: That’s your look for me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I just thought I’d say hi. I was in the
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You were not.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I was not.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Come over after I’m done here?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I can’t. I want to, but I have to
study.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You rat.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I really want to, but tonight’s important.
Test tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How could she have done this to me? How could
anyone do this to anyone?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You didn’t say anything about my
hair.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It’s so cool. You’re by far the most
sensational person in the room.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: In the room?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: In the world.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What’s happening here? Oh, God! I have to go
home. They’ll be there soon.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Gotta get home. How could she do this to me?
How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck!
What a fucking monster she is!</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Oh, God. I miss her. I can’t believe
she’s with that guy now! I’m never going to see her again. I love her so
much. What a fucking monster she is!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Them.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello again, Mr. Barish. Good, you’ve got your
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How are you today? Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Ah, Mr. Barish. This is Stan. He’ll be in
charge of your procedure tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Mr. Barish.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How exactly is this going to work tonight?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We’ll start with your most recent
memories and go backwards – There is an emotional core to each of our
memories – As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process
– By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we’ve targeted
will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Well, technically, the procedure itself
is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing
you’ll miss.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s happening now! I’m already in my
brain.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Yes, I suppose you are. So, let’s get
started – If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We use the articles you brought to create a
map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we’ll be able
to trace the map and erase.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But you’re tracing and erasing now. It’s
already started. I’m home in my bed.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We’ll dispose of these mementos when
we’re done here. That way you won’t be confused later by their
unexplainable presence in your home.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Good. We’re getting healthy read-outs.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: Patrick, do me a favor –</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: – and check the voltage levels, I’m
not wiping as clean as I would like here.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: The voltage looks fine.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Then check the connections.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Does that help?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Ah, your journal. This will be
invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight.
Oh, Christ: I don’t know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she’s
amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things
with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: I think we got this one. Let’s push
on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: My name is Joel Barish. I have an
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please have a seat. Dr. Mierzwiak will be
right with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Not great.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I’m sorry you saw one of our notification
cards. You never should have.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well… I did.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We can help you through this. Why don’t
you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your
relationship with Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It was a mess. I don’t know how it got this
way…</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: It’s kind of a dump, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s an apartment.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
Uninspired. And there’s a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don’t know.
Stuffy.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Patrick, let’s just get through this. We have
a long night ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: So who do you think is better-looking, me
or this guy?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: So we’ll need you to go home and bring in
everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might
remind you of her…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So then she just stops calling.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I wasn’t going to call her. Not after
the way she was.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Any messages, Carmen?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Any messages for me, Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Nothing, Joel.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: It’s bullshit. She’s punishing me for
being honest with her.</p>
<p><strong>phone machine voice</strong>: You have no messages.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sorry, Carmen. Any messages?</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: That’s it. I’m just gonna–</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I’m gonna tell her I’m through playing
games and –</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: The number you have dialed has been
disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Why would she do that?</p>
<p><strong>vague recorded voice</strong>: – If you think you have
reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial
again.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I don’t know, honey. It’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: She’s punishing me for being honest. I should
just go to her house.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I don’t think you should go there, Joel.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I don’t want to seem desperate.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to
move on. Just make a clean break.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know. I’m so… I can’t believe she’d be
so goddamn immature!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Joel, look, the thing is –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Joel, honey… We have to feed the dog. Would
you just wait here? Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You weren’t supposed to see that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: They can’t erase memories. It’s a joke. It’s a
nasty Clementine hoax.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sweetie, we called the company.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Lacuna: Noun. A blank, a missing
portion, especially in a manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>carrie’s voice</strong>: You can’t tell her, Joel. They
explained that. Like waking a sleepwalker. It might have a devastating
effect.</p>
<p><strong>carrie’s voice</strong>: Think about it: to be told you lived
an existence of which you have no recollection.</p>
<p><strong>joel’s voice</strong>: But what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>carrie’s voice</strong>: Move on, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>joel’s voice</strong>: How can I? How can I move on when I
know I’m the only one to carry this love we had? How do I do that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hi, May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: So, Mary’s coming over tonight.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Just wanted to let you know.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I like Mary. I like when she comes to
visit. I just don’t think she likes me.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: She likes you okay.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
over, too. I have a girlfriend now.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You can if you want.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: This one’s history. Moving on…</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: The thing is … my situation is a little
weird. My girlfriend situation.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Patrick, we need to focus.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yo ho ho!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s three.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Shit. The last time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I
kinda sorta wrecked your car…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t believe you wrecked my car.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re driving drunk. It’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: …a little. I was a little tipsy. Don’t
call me pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well it is pathetic. And fucking
irresponsible. You could’ve killed somebody.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know, maybe you did kill somebody.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh Christ I didn’t kill anybody. It’s
just a fucking dent. You’re like some old lady or something.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Right! She called me an old lady here,
too! And I remember, I said…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And what are you like? A wino?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
A wino! Face it, Joel. You’re freaked out because I was out late without
you, and in your little wormy brain, you’re trying to figure out, did
she fuck someone tonight?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone
tonight. Isn’t that how you get people to like you?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry. Okay. I didn’t mean that. I just… I
was just… pissed, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Let me drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look at it out here. It’s falling apart. I’m
erasing you. And I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You did it to me. I can’t believe you did this
to me. By morning you’ll be gone. Ha!</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: See, remember that girl? The one we
did last week? The one with the potatoes?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: Yeah, that’s this guy’s girlfriend.
Was.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell
in love with her last night.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: She was unconscious, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and
voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Jesus, Patrick!</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: I know. It’s not like… I mean, they
were clean and all.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: Look, just don’t tell me this stuff. I
don’t want to know this shit.</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: We have work to do.</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: Okay, but there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: After we did her, I went to where
she worked and I asked her out.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: Patrick… do you know how
unethical…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That must be the guy I saw you with.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: In the bookstore that night. The skinny
guy.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: How can you watch this crap?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m fucking crawling out of my skin.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I want to have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Let’s talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No. I want to have a baby. I have to
have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t think we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re not ready.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clementine, do you really think you could take
care of a kid?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t want to talk about this here.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, We’re fucking gonna talk about
it!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You can’t fucking say something like
that and say you don’t want to talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clem, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’d make a fucking good mother! I love
children! I’m creative and smart and I’d make a fucking good mother!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh, thank God. It’s going.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s you! It’s you who can’t commit to
anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I’m interested in you! I
don’t even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave
you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s going, Clementine. All the crap and hurt
and disappointment. It’s all being wiped away.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So, um –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Would you get me another, Joely?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Thanky! Thanky!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, this is Mark. He likes my boobs.
He came over special to tell me that. Isn’t that nice. He doesn’t think
I’m fat.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I didn’t know she was with someone, man.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: S’okay, Mark. Joel doesn’t like my
boobs. I don’t think he likes girls.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re a whiz kid. So perceptive, so
–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, hey, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hi, Mary. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hey, you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s freezing out.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You found us okay?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We haven’t checked.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, allow me to do the honors. It’s fucking
freezing and I need something.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mary hates me. I’ve never been popular with
the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Maybe if you stopped stealing their
panties.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Okay, There’s more, Stan –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hey, hey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Patrick, you didn’t want any, did you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nah, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the
better even of their blunders.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my
Bartletts.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: That’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, I can’t wait to tell Howard! It seems
really appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s a good one all right.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: What’s your bartlett’s?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s a quote book.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He
actually has a quotation in Bartlett’s about Bartlett’s. Isn’t that
trippy?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Yeah. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “The quotations when engraved upon the memory
give you good thoughts.”</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Very cool. Trippy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I like to read what smart people say. So many
beautiful, important things.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t you think Howard’s like that? Smart?
Important?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Definitely!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think he’ll be in Bartlett’s one day.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You don’t tell me things, Joel. I’m an
open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You
don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No, it isn’t that.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I want to know you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I just don’t have anything very interesting
about my life.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, you’re a liar.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How’s the chicken?</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Is that like us? Are we just bored with
each other?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: More?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: How’s the fish?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>patrick’s voice</strong>: Hi, Clementine! – Why, what’s
wrong? – Oh, I’m sorry. – Well, I’m not sure, I kind of have to study
for my test –</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hold on. Let me ask my friend. Stan, can I
leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Patrick, we’re in the middle of –</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: She’s right in the neighborhood. She’s
upset.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Let him go, Stan. I can help.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mary hates me. I’ll be right over,
Tangerine.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joely…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, Tangerine?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s my favorite book. Since I was a
kid. It’s about these toys. There’s this part where the skin Horse tells
the rabbit what it means to be real. I can’t believe I’m crying already.
He says, “It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t often happen to
people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully
kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been
loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and
very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are
Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No! Jesus, No!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Please! Please! I’ve changed my mind! I don’t
want this. Wake me up! Stop the procedure! Plea –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s amazing, isn’t it? Such a gift Howard
gave the world.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: To let people begin again. It’s beautiful. You
look at a baby and it’s so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults… they’re
like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness… hopelessness.
And Howard just makes it go away.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You love him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. Besides, Howard’s married, Stan. He’s a
very serious and ethical man. I’m not going to tempt him to betray all
he believes in.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Oh, baby, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I don’t know. I’m lost. I’m scared. I
feel like I’m disappearing. I’m getting old and nothing makes any sense
to me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Oh, Tangerine.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes
any sense.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Come up to Boston with me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Sure. We’ll go next weekend and –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to
see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Um, okay. I’ll call my study partner.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yay! It’ll be great! I’ll get my
shit.</p>
<p><strong>joel’s voice</strong>: Hi, it’s Joel. Please leave a message
after the beep.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Stan, it’s Patrick. Pick up.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: Hey, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I got into a situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone? I’m really sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I can handle it. He’s pretty much on
auto-pilot anyway.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Thanks, Stan. I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: I took Joel to walk on Charles
River with me last night. It was so beautiful and charming. Joel was
nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much
– he’s so sweet – that he came out after me. We lay down right in the
center and watched the stars. He took my hand and said “I could…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: …die right now, Clem. I’m just… happy. I’ve
never felt that before. I’m just exactly where I want to be.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clem, no! This can’t keep happening. Please!
Oh, fuck! Please!</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We can help you through this. Why don’t
you start now by telling me everything you can remember about –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You have to stop this!</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: What? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m trapped in my head and everything I love
is being erased! Stop it now!</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Yes, but… I’m just something you’re
imagining. What can I do? I’m in your head, too.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: … and we made love right on the
ice. It was absolutely freezing on my ass! It was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m so excited. Yay!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I’m excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give
you this. It’s a little… thing.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I didn’t have a chance to wrap it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s gorgeous. Just my taste. I’ve never
gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thanks.
So let’s get going. Long drive.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Such a beautiful view.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yes indeed. Fuck! They’re erasing you,
Clem!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I hired them to. We’re in my brain. But I want
it to stop, before I wake up and don’t know you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Wow. Um, well… can’t you just force
yourself awake?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Aaargh! It’s horrible! I’m trapped!</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: She’s so sexy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I loved you on this day. I love this memory.
The rain. Us just hanging.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What if you hide me?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well… if they’re looking for me in
memories I’m in, what if you take me to a memory I’m not in? And we can
hide there till morning.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Where? Where? Where?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Jesus. What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I must be about two. I want my mommy. She’s
busy. She’s not looking at me. Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll! I told
you about this! I want my mommy!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I want my mommy. I don’t want to lose you,
Clem.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m scared. I want my mommy. I don’t want to
lose you. I don’t want to lose…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, Joely, look… it’s not fading. The
memory. I think we’re hidden.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s stopped.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Listen, it’s not erasing.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s not erasing. He’s off the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I don’t know. He’s not on the map.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I don’t know what to do! I don’t know what to
do! Crap. Crap…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, what should we do?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I don’t know! I just said that!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sor-ry We have to do something. He can’t wake
up half done.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We should call Howard.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: No way. I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This guy’s only half cooked. There’s no time
to fuck around, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hello, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Stan? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: The guy we’re doing? He’s disappeared
from the map. I can’t find him anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Okay, what happened right before he
disappeared?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: I was away from the monitor for a
second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Well, where was Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: He went home sick.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Jesus. All right, what’s the address.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s voice</strong>: 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E,
Rockville Center.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s coming?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You better go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hell no.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shit, I’m so stoned. I don’t want him to see
me stoned. Stop being stoned, Mary!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: God, I look like shit! God!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: How’s my baby boy?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I really want her to pick me up. It’s weird
how strong that desire is.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You know, we’re okay. They’re not
finding us. You’ll remember me in the morning. And you’ll come to me and
tell me about us and we’ll start over.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I loved you so much this day. On my bed in
your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have
you on my bed in your panties.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You remember what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I came over to the bed and you smelled so
good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed
with you and you said something like –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: – another rainy day. Whatever shall we
do?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: There’s this guy!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: There’s this guy. I heard him talking in my
apartment. He’s one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they
were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a
stranger and now you’re dating him.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Really? Is he cute?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: He stole a pair of your panties while you were
being erased!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Gross! You must remember to tell me this
in the morning. I’m, like, so freaked out now.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Nothing is wrong with you. You’re the most
wonderful person I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There he is. Oh my God. Oh my God. Do I look
okay?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m still stoned. Are you? Crap.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your Visine didn’t do shit, fella.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Mary. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: She came to help, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I wanted to learn as much about the procedure
as possible, Howard. I think it’s important for my job…to help comfort
the clientele. You know.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Let’s get to the bottom of this. Shall
we?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Odd.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I tried that already.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Did you try going through C-Gate?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I’m going to do a Spectrum search
throughout his memory, see if anything comes up.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Okay, here it is. I don’t know why it’s
off the map like that, but –</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Little baby getting awwwl cleean. Awl
clean.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I love getting bathed in the sink. It’s such a
feeling of security.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’ve never seen you happier.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Okay, we’re back in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a
surgeon or a concert pianist.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Well, thank you, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You get some sleep, Howard. I’ll take it from
here.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Yeah, probably a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: But can’t you see… I love you,
Antoine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Don’t call me Antoine. My name is Wally.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yes, but I can’t love a man named
Wally.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: They found us before. The plan didn’t work. I
don’t know what to do now.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere
buried?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Howard, they’ve disappeared again.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Look at you, cutey! What are we
doing?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit
out of me.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I’m terrified. I thought if I hung
around the art room long enough, he’d go home and I could get my
bike.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Poor Joel.</p>
<p><strong>joe early</strong>: Hi, Jill.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me Jill after
this.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Just shut up, Joe. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>joe early</strong>: I don’t think so. We’re fighting.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t want to fight you.</p>
<p><strong>joe early</strong>: C’mon, Jill. Get up, faggot. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m too scared to even throw a punch. When I
tell people this story I leave that part out.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We got him back. Stan, I think I’m just
going to have to get through this manually. We’re running late.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Our house! Our house!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clem, c’mon, we’ve got to hide you.
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t like it either, but I’m just trying to
find horrible secret place to –</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Joel, I was just – Oh. Um… I’ll ask you in
the morning, honey. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh, Joel. It’s beautiful! I mean, you’re
the first guy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry I could honestly say
that about.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I scoured the city for it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I love it!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: C’mon, Joel, you have to. Do it already.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t. I have to go home. I’ll do it
later.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I didn’t want to do this. But I had to
or they would’ve called me a girl.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I can’t believe I did that. I’m so
ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s okay. You were a little kid. This
is a great birthday present. Getting to see you as a boy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s where I live. Lived.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I’m getting the hang of it. I still
understand it. But I’m finding him quickly enough. I’m hopeful there
won’t be too much peripheral eradication.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I like watching you work.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I’ll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: That’s fine, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you like quotes, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading
them inspirational to me. And in my reading I’ve come across some I
thought you might like, too.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Oh. Well, I’d love to hear some.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay, um, there’s one that goes “Blessed are
the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.”</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Is that Nietzsche?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was
thinking I could tell you something you didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: It’s a good quote, Mary. I’m glad we both
know it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s another one I like, I read. It’s by
Pope Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Alexander Pope?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It’s just I
told myself I wasn’t going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope
and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You are such a sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Anyway, the quote goes “How happy is the
blameless Vestal’s lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot:
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each
wish resign’d”.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: That’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe.
That’s all. I really admire the work that you do. I know it’s not proper
to be so familiar but I guess since we’re outside the workplace I feel a
certain liberty to –</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: It’s fine, Mary. I’m happy to hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard…
an awful lot. Is that terrible?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: You’re a wonderful girl, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve loved you for a very long time. I’m
sorry! I shouldn’t have said that.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I’ve got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your
kids.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No you’re right. Once again. You’re a decent
man, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I want you to know it’s not because I’m
not interested. If that means anything.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Hollis! Hollis!</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: I knew it, Howard. I don’t even know why I
bothered to copy the damn address.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: It didn’t start out to be this. I came
here to work. It’s a one-time mistake.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mrs. Mierzwiak, it’s true. And it’s not
Mr. Mierzwiak’s fault. I’m a stupid little girl with a stupid little
crush. I basically forced him into it. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Don’t be a monster, Howard. Tell the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>hollis</strong>: Poor kid. You can have him. You did.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: We… have a history. I’m sorry. You wanted
the procedure. You wanted it done… to get past. I have to finish in
there. It’s almost morning. We’ll talk later.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Let me take you home.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: I could die right now, Clem. I’m just
happy. I’ve never felt that before. I’m just exactly where I want to
be.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I love this book, Joel. Thank you so
much for telling me about it.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t be like me, son. Don’t waste your
life. You’ll come to a point someday where it’ll be too late. You’ll be
sewn into your fate…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It was horrifying, seeing my father like that.
There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure. And he saw
failure in me, too, written in my future.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, you’re not sewn in. He’s
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: …and there’ll be nowhere to go except where
you’re headed, like a train on a track. Inevitable, unalterable.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m done, Clem. I’m just going to ride it out.
Hiding is clearly not working.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I want to enjoy my little time left with
you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: This is our first “date” date.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Do you remember what we talked about?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Naomi, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What was I wearing?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: God, I should know. Your hair was red. I
remember it matched the wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Egad, were you horrified?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No! I think you were wearing that black dress,
y’know, with the buttons.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, you were with me when I bought that.
At that place on East 6th. It was later.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Right. Something black though.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’ll buy that. Black’s always good.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: We did talk about Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I said: Are you sure? You seem
unsure.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sure, I said.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: But you weren’t. I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I was so nervous. I remember I couldn’t think
of anything to say. There were long silences.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I thought I was foolish. I thought I’d
mistaken infatuation for love. You said:</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: So what. Infatuation is good, too.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And I didn’t have an argument.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I dropped you off after. You said –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Come up and see me… now.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s very late.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: This was our first time.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak voice</strong>: Okay, so just tell me what you
remember. And we’ll take it from there.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: Um, I liked you immediately. At the
job interview. You seemed so… important and mature. And I loved that you
were helping all these people. You didn’t come on to me at all. I liked
that. I was tongue-tied around you at first. I wanted you to think I was
smart. You were so nice. I loved the way you smelled. I couldn’t wait to
come to work. I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids
and just… …and so… then… when… that one day, when I thought you looked
at me back… like… Oh, Howie, I can’t do this? How can I do this?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak voice</strong>: It’s what’s best, Mary. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: Yeah, I know. Oh, God. Okay, well, I
was so excited…</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: …Remember you bought me that little
wind-up frog?</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: And you said…</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “This is for your desk. Just a little
token”</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: I knew then… I knew something was
going to happen… something wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if
I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a
thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had
momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren’t happy. That was
the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to
stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and
the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was
real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn’t much fun. But
I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I
thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I’m being
suckered by advertising and movie bullshit… then I thought maybe not,
maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my
argument, about dying.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I projected myself to the end of my life
in some vague rendition of my old man self. I imagined looking back with
a tremendous hole of regret in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I didn’t pick up the phone to call you,
Naomi. I didn’t pick up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Yours?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You take it. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope
it’s possible for us to stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Don’t do this to me now, Joel. Really.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I told her today I need to end it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I did it. I guess that means something.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: So what’s going on, Joel?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know, I’ve just been thinking, maybe
we’re not happy with each other.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Y’know, we’ve been, I don’t know, sort of,
unhappy with each other and –</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Don’t say “we” when you mean “you.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think maybe, we’re both so used to operating
at this level that – How can one person be unhappy? If one person is
unhappy, both have to be… by definition.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No. I just need some space, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think
you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you’re just going
to be Joel with the same fucking problems.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s not somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I hate myself.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Is there a Clementine who works here?</p>
<p><strong>male employee #1</strong>: Mark, is Clem on tonight?</p>
<p><strong>male employee #2</strong>: On my dick, bro. Oh, hey. Yeah, I
think she’s upstairs in Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I didn’t think you’d show your face
around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after
all.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Sorry to track you down like this. I’m not a
stalker. But I needed to see you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’d like to… take you out or something.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, you’re married.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Not yet. Not married.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Look, man, I’m telling you right off the
bat, I’m high maintenance. So I’m not going to tiptoe around your
marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with
me, you’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: So make your domestic decisions and
maybe we’ll talk again.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I just think that you have some kind of…
quality that seems really important to me.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, I’m not a concept. I want you to
just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I’m a concept or I
complete them or I’m going to make them alive, but I’m just a fucked-up
girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don’t assign me yours.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I remember that speech really well.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I had you pegged, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You had the whole human race pegged.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I still thought you were going to save me.
Even after that.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It would be different, if we could just give
it another go around.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we
can.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I hope you feel better, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Say hi to Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I hope she’s not up. I need to
think.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I met someone tonight at a party on the
beach. Her name is Clementine. There is something alive about her.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You didn’t miss much. Rob Carrie say
hello.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Hi, Rob and Carrie.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Yeah. Come to bed. I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve
been feeling so alienated and numb lately. Forever. The thought of not
acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive. How can I
continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with
obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? I need to
speak with Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I’ve got to finish this chapter anyway.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay. I wish you could come.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: This is it. The night we met. My God,
it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I hope you get your work done.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m sorry Naomi couldn’t make it. You okay?
You seem quiet.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Just a little overworked, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: The trip to the party where I met
Clementine. My first memory of her is now my last memory of her.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I remember you turned around. Your face was
dark and your hair was backlit – I could see a halo of frizz – you asked
me if things were okay between Naomi and me.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I did. You said, things were fine.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This is the night you met Clementine, Joel.
I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh
shit.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, you told me that later.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I told you that later.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Who was the girl you walked off with?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Is this the right way?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You were down by the surf. I could just make
you out in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I
would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I
thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, I love this woman because she’s alone down there looking out
at the black ocean.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: But I went back to my food. The next thing I
remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I was so nervous. What were you doing
there, I wondered. Your hair was lime green. Green revolution.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You said…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I saw you sitting over here. By
yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn’t know how
interact at these things either.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah. I don’t ever know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I can’t tell you how happy I am to hear
that. I mean, I don’t mean I’m happy you’re uncomfortable, but, yknow…
I’m such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I’m going
to be different and it’s always exactly the same and then I hate myself
after for being such a clod.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Even then I didn’t believe you entirely. I
thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn’t talk to
people?</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: But I thought, I don’t know, I thought
it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling
and that you were attracted to it.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: But, I don’t know, maybe we’re the
normal ones, y’know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: And I just liked you so much.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You did? You liked me?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You know what I did.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah, I know. I’m fishing.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You said –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of
your chicken?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: And you picked it out of my plate before I
could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I remember –</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: The grease on your chin in the bonfire
light.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh God, how horrid.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m Joel.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: No, it was lovely.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You mean, like… Oh, my darlin’, oh, my
darlin’, oh, my darlin’, Clementine… ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah, like that.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a
kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: This is it, Joel. It’s gonna be gone
soon.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Enjoy it. Say good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So you’re still on the Zoloft?</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: Next thing I remember we were walking
down near the surf.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, I stopped. I didn’t want to feel
like I was being artificially modulated.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I know what you mean. That’s why I
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: But my sleeping is really fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t think I’ve slept in a year.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You should try Xanax. I mean, it’s a
chemical and all, but it works… and it works just having it around,
knowing that it’s there. Like insurance.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: yeah?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’ll give you a couple. See what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Have you ever read any Anna
Akhmatova?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I love her.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Really? Me, too! I don’t meet people who
even know who she is and I work in a book store.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think she’s great.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Me too. There’s this poem –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Did this conversation come before or after we
saw the house?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I think, before.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Seems too coincidental that way.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Do you know her poem that starts
“Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don’t live…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, yeah. It goes “Perhaps there is someone
in this world to whom I could send all these lines”?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my
heart. I’m so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don’t
live.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I wish we did. You married?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Um, no.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Let’s move into this neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I do sort of live with somebody though.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Male or female?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Female.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: At least I haven’t been barking up the
wrong tree.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: It’s freezing out here.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I couldn’t believe you did that. I was
paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: C’mon, man. The water’s fine. Nobody’s
coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity’s
off.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I hesitated for what seemed like forever.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I could see you wanted to come in,
Joel.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: As soon as you walked in. I knew I had
you. You knew I knew that, right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I knew.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
wasn’t the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yeah. What’s your girlfriend’s name?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles,
matches, and the liquor cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think we should go.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: No, it’s our house! Just tonight – –
we’re David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be
Ruth but I’m flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I’m going find the
bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I’m ruthless at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I really should go. I really need to catch my
ride.</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: I didn’t want to go. I was too nervous.
I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: So go.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I
was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to
the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, “so go” with
such disdain.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What if you stay this time?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I walked out the door. There’s no more
memory.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Come back and make up a good-bye at
least. Let’s pretend we had one.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Bye, Joel.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Did you have fun?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hollis’s voice</strong>: Hi, you’ve reached the Mierzwiaks.
We can’t come to –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: So, I’ve got to drop the van off.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Thanks, Stan. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: You want to stop for coffee or
something?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Well, it was sure beautiful on that river.
Thanks for sharing it with me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Well do it again soon.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you swear you didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I swear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And you never even suspected? Never saw us
behaving in any unusual way together?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Once, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It was here. At his car. I was coming back
from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You
giggled.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How did I look?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Happy. Happy with a secret.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And after that?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I never saw you together like that again. So I
figured I was imagining things.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I really like you, Mary. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you remember anything else? What I was
wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like
I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me
everything.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You were in red. That red sweater with the
little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car. He looked a
little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I’d never seen him look
like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re nice. But I love him. I knew I loved
him. Now I know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi… Naomi? Yeah, hi! How are you? I know, I
know. It’s been a long time. Not too much. You? Oh, that’s great!
Congratulations! Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate? Tonight? I’m
free. Okay, good!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I need this signed, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thanks. So… do we talk about this… or
what?</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I don’t know what I’m supposed say, Mary.
I want to do the right thing here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I
listened to my tape. I can’t believe I’ve been sitting right in front of
it for a year. It’s like listening to someone else’s story. I mean, I
hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can’t even imagine
you naked. I can’t even say “naked” to you!</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I have a family, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You made me have an abortion.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: It was a mutual decision.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You made me have you erased! I loved you. I
love you! How could you –</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I didn’t make you. You thought it best.
But, look, I take full responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: So… you haven’t been involved with anyone in
all this time?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s been a pretty lonely couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Well, it was my fault – the break-up. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We
were taking each other for granted and –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for
a little while.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oh! Great. That’s great!</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: A religion instructor at Columbia. A good
guy. He’s a good guy.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry. I really shouldn’t have –</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I’m glad you called.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: So you think the dissertation will get
published?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I don;t know. I’m not sure there’s a big
public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: So you’ll call me, right?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Tonight. Just to test out the phone
lines.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi, Naomi, it’s Joel.</p>
<p><strong>naomi’s voice</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>naomi’s voice</strong>: Good. I called you at work today.
They said you were home sick.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I know. I had to take the day to think.</p>
<p><strong>naomi’s voice</strong>: Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you
get my message?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I just got in.</p>
<p><strong>naomi’s voice</strong>: Long day thinking.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah, I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>naomi on machine</strong>: Hi. They told me you were sick!
So… Where are you?! I had a really nice time last night. Just wanted to
say hi, so… hi. Call me. I’m home. Call me!</p>
<p><strong>naomi’s voice</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: There you are. Naomi, it’s just… I’m afraid if
we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had…</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Okay, Joel. I suppose you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I had a good time last night. I really
did.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: So I’m going to get some sleep. I’m glad
you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: We’ll speak soon.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I just walked in.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Hmmm. Do you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Oddly enough, I do.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess
that means we’re married.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Tomorrow night… honeymoon on
ice.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s really solid this time
of year.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: This is so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know. What if it breaks?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: What if?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I think I should go back.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Joel, come here. Please.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Listen, did you want to make love?</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Make love?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Have sex. Y’know –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Oh, um…</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned
enough to make that happen right now.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: That’s okay. I –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m sorry. I just wanted to say that. This
seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Hey, Joel –</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: – and I’m just too nervous around you right
now.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I’m nervous, too.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Yeah? I wouldn’t have thought that.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, you obviously don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m nervous because I have and enormous crush
on you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Show me which constellations you
know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Did you send this? Is it a joke?</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: I probably got the same thing as
you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I mean, I haven’t even told anyone I’ve met
you. Who would even know to do this?</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Maybe it’s true then. It’s my
voice on the tape.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s what you have to say? How could it be
true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Maybe. Call someone who’d know.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yes, Joel. It is true. We weren’t supposed
to say anything. They say it’s like waking a sleepwalker.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: I know. I spoke to my friend
Magda.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Look, I have to go. I have to think.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Joel, we’ve fucked. We’ve made
love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with
each other last night. Isn’t that lovely?</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Come over here, sweetheart.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Says you were closed off, non
communicative, never told me what you were feeling.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Says you were a bully…</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: A bully? Moi?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: That’s what it says. You drank too much, you
picked on me for being passive and timid.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man. Says
you were jealous and suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Says you would sometimes disappear all night,
then brag to me about your sexual conquests.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Did I use the term “sexual conquests” or
is that your way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Doesn’t sound like me.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
panties and dirty socks in your wake.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Says you were constantly calling me a
slob. It’s sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and
overly-familiar and bored. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy
version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: We should have sex. It’s old hat for
us.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You know my body like the back of your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Every curve, every freckle.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You’re so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I work here. I used to work here. Stan. Please
just tell Howard I’m here to clean out my desk.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to – Yes
sir. He says he needs to see you.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: She should not have done this, Stan. As
mad as she was… as justifiably –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Howard.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: Mary has stolen our files and is sending
them back to people.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: … so I called everybody I know and
asked them to tell me everything. Now I know my entire history with him,
but it’s in the form of a story, I’m losing my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: This is why people must never be told.
It’s like waking a –</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: I don’t know what to do. Before I
thought I was depressed for no reason. Now it’s like I’ve been assigned
a reason.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: This never should’ve happened, ma’am. We’ll
take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>mierzwiak</strong>: I know you don’t like me much, Stan, but
please talk to Mary. She of all people should know this is a dangerous
thing she’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Hi, it’s Joel.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I’m just, y’know, passing the time best I can
till I can see you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: God, I can’t believe I ever
hated you.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: You must have been crazy.</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Guess what I’m wearing.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I don’t know. Panties and –</p>
<p><strong>clementine’s voice</strong>: Your dried cum.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: You’re still excited by my irreverence.
You haven’t yet started to think of it as my “gratuitous need to
shock.”</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: I can’t stop thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: Yay. Meet me after work by the old
mill.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: What old mill? Is that somewhere we –</p>
<p><strong>clementine</strong>: I just wanted to say that. Come by my
house.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What do you want, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Can I… I brought some –</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then why did you ask me?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I don’t know. I just – there are a lot of
really confused people showing up at the office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They have a right to know. Howard is a thief.
He steals the truth. I can’t remember my baby! I can’t remember my baby.
It existed and I can’t even remember. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Mary, people come to him voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I won’t allow it. Those who cannot remember
the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That’s
from my quote book.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: The office is filled with people who want
their memories re-erased.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Mary… please. This is hurting people.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t want to hurt people. But these things
happened! All these little sadnesses, the big ones. What if no one
remembers? What does that do to the world? Someone has to remember,
Stan.</p>
<p><strong>sad woman’s voice</strong>: I was by myself in the park
because my friend Davia was sick that day. I was on a swing. There was
this smiling man walking a little bushy dog –</p>
<p><strong>sad woman’s voice</strong>: The man said something like,
“He’s friendly –”</p>
<p><strong>sad woman’s voice</strong>: “– he won’t bite.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He won’t bite. You can pet him if you want…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Do you want to give him a biscuit?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: They’re in my car. Why don’t you –</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman’s voice</strong>: Excuse me? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: I’m here for Dr. Mierzwiak. My
name is Helene Kernfeld.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, please have a seat. The doctor will be
with you momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Howard, your 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>sad woman’s voice</strong>: He took me to his car and …</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I…I… I… find you physically repulsive! I can’t
even look at you!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: How are you today, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Let’s see… Still dying, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You don’t have to jump down my throat. I
was trying to be nice.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Well, don’t try. It’s unbecoming on
you.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>second old woman</strong>: I’d like to make an
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I think the doctor is free this morning.
He can probably take you right away for an initial consultation.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
Kruczynski. She’d like to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hello, Ms. Kruczynski. Nice to meet you.
Please have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Would you mind if I tape our
discussion?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: So, why don’t you begin by telling me why
you’ve come here.</p>
<p><strong>second old woman</strong>: Well, I met this man, Joel, three
years ago at a senior dance… We’d both been alone for so long and…</p>
<p><strong>second old woman</strong>: I remember Joel and I were having
breakfast –</p>
<p><strong>second old woman</strong>: – I said something like we should
go upstate and see the leaves change…</p>
<p>****: He just stared at me as if I didn’t exist. As if I had never
existed…</p>
<p><strong>second old woman</strong>: – his eyes used to be so filled
with love. But it was gone. How can I go back to being alone after
seeing love? I was alone for so long. What had I done with my life? I
was alone so long.</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: Hi, it’s Joel. What’s going on,
Clem? Why won’t you call me back? Please call me. We need to speak.</p>
