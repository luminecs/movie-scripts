<h1 id="perfect-creature">perfect-creature</h1>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: For three hundred years the great plagues
have swept the earth. Diseases created from the experiments of the
Alchemists.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: …but there was also a miracle. One of these
plagues helped nature create a new kind of being. At first they were
called Nosferatu, or Vampire and were feared. But they were not
supernatural monsters, just a better version of ourselves. They were the
Brothers, and their religion and science helped sustain us against the
plagues and influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest of the
colonies. For 300 years our two races have lived in harmony. Until
now…</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: See here. This is what you need to
look for.</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: A genetic mutation, we all carry it.
But we now know a virus activates it.</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: This Virus plays some unknown role
in the birth the Brothers. Of course the mutation occurs very rarely
these days. And only in males.</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: Strange isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: That God would choose such humble
vehicle for a miracle. The mothers invariably come from the slums, we
don’t know why. This is your 7th isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: Yes, her first was successful, a
Brother was born. Thereafter variously malformed offspring. We can only
hope this one will be different. You’ll have to try harder this
time.</p>
<p><strong>woman in the surgury</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>woman in the surgury</strong>: Please… I want to keep my
baby. They always take my babies away.</p>
<p><strong>genetic doctor</strong>: Don’t be stupid woman!</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: This is your brother Silus. You will teach
him.</p>
<p><strong>silus as a boy</strong>: Is that my mother?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: No, not any more.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Welcome to the world little Brother.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: 6</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: The girl?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: This is good.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her
to help us catch him, and then we failed her.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Yes. But her death served a greater good.
Every trap needs bait.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Are you sure you won’t join me?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps we should
inform the authorities. The human beings.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: For now the Brothers feel we should deal
with this ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: If they find out we are covering up these
deaths…</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Which is why you must find him. Silus.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: For centuries we Brothers have served
mankind and them us. The great union. But remember your history. 300
years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our
children as monsters. They had no notion of evolution. In another world
we might all have been slaughtered, only to be remembered in myth,
monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists. We must
refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the
two races. The old prejudices are still there. Human beings are paranoid
creatures by nature.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Perhaps they have good reason.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Silus. Simply concern yourself with
finding Edgar. Find your Brother so that we can help him. Before he
kills again.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Everyone’s ready Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: About time.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: On three gents. One, two…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Don’t you move!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Don’t you dare.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Jones!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: God help us. What an appalling sight.</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: I don’t know nothing about it. I give
’em out. Make sure everyone gets ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: That’s a lie! We know you’ve been trading
influenza vaccine in the workhouses!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Lil’. I think you should see this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d use the mask if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>woman in the basement</strong>: Help me. Please help.</p>
<p><strong>woman in the basement</strong>: Please. I’m sick. Please.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’re a fucking liar!</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: No, no, I swear it, I gave ’em their
boosters, both of ’em. I’m a responsible landlord, I swear to god. There
must’ve been something wrong with them vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: This is a civil health violation! You’re
going to the hell house for this. You can forget lovely Doris here where
you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: I don’t know what you’re on about.
I’ve done nothing, I swear to god, I’ve done nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It is my pleasure to inform you that you are
under arrest for trafficking influenza vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: I want my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: This is a violation of the 12/10 health act,
whereby you have withheld borough sponsored vaccines from your
tenants.</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: I want a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Anything you say will be held against you as
evidence and, by endangering the public good, you are not entitled to a
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>slum landlord</strong>: Fuck you then.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: There’s only one other thing.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Oi! How about me? He promised me some of
that. I earned it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come one!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Lil’, you want some?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Smells terrible.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’m not letting that scum put me off my food.
That’d be like a moral victory.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’ll get out here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s up with her?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jones? Is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yeah. Lilly’s kid. It died of the influenza,
didn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She’s never said anything about a kid.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No. She never says anything.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey?! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>man in the street</strong>: Where are you going in such a
hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering by the look of you?</p>
<p><strong>man in the street</strong>: What’s going on here? What’d you
do to her?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Don’t, I didn’t do nothing. It was a Brother.
It was a Brother did it.</p>
<p><strong>man in the street</strong>: Oh dear god…</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: 300 years ago, with these simple
instruments, the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today
call genetic science.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: He deciphered that the Brothers were a new
race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: De Angelo formed the church of the
Brotherhood. He was a great great man, but there were others, bad men,
who took what De Angelo had discovered and experimented without concern
for the results. The science of genetics and all its power has been
banned ever since. Who can tell me what came from these bad
experiments?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: All the bad things. Like bad germs and
flu.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Yes. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: All the bad things.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Someone should flatten this cesspool and
start again.</p>
<p><strong>street reporter</strong>: Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any
comments on the death?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>street reporter</strong>: They’re saying it was a Brother, is
that true?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Arrest her.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Find any witnesses and shut them up.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Can I step in?</p>
<p><strong>forensic guy</strong>: With the traffic. What’s it
matter.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Lil’.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Hello Dominic.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: It’s a bite. If you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Any identification?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Tanya Garfield.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Where do you get a cup of tea around
here?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There’s a kid who saw it, down there.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Says it was a Brother. And they’ve got
another fellow, that’s all who saw it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Alright, we’ll close this down gents. None of
you are to say a word, not even to your old mother.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Jones. Make sure.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He saw what happened?</p>
<p><strong>policeman 1</strong>: Now he wont talk. Didn’t see
anything.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What’s your name then?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Albert.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You live around here?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I grew up 3 streets from here. Matheson Lane.
The Skrummers Workhouse.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Or should I say, I crawled out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No one else will do anything about this, you
know? They just think this is a slum. No one really cares what happens
to the people here. Except for you. And me.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: A man.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What kind of man?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: A Brother.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You’re sure it was a Brother?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He had teeth and everything.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He went straight up there.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Alright, you go with these men, they’ll look
after you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Get him to describe it all. And keep him away
from everyone.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And get him some food.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Now they’ll all want feeding.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’ve quarantined the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: As far as anyone knows we have a new
influenza outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What about the telephonic companies?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: They’re cooperating, closing all phone lines
in and out except directly to us.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Sit, sit.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You’ve done well Lilly. The reporter is
more of a problem. We have 2 days by law before we have to release her.
Then it’s out.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I hate these things. I’m like a pin
cushion.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It’s better than the alternative, sir.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I need you to stay with this, Lilly. You
know Jamestown better than anyone, how to handle the people.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: The Brothers have requested to be involved
with the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That’s nice for them.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You have a problem with it?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Good. I think they can help. And I don’t
want someone working on this whose got something against the Church.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: How do you know I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Lilly, you’re the least prejudiced person
I know. In fact, you’re the only one I know. That’s important. The
church is powerful, but more than that, people’s faith in the
Brotherhood is about all they’ve got these days. And the government
knows it. Even the Queen herself is involved. This is political.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Lil’. He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Do you know who he is? That’s Brother Silus.
They say one day he will lead the Brotherhood. He’s a great man.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I think I hear choir music.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Do you respect anything?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey. My old mum goes to church four times a
week and gives blood. She’s happy as a lark. Just don’t expect me to
kiss him, that’s all I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Senior Brother Edgar… How long have you known
about this?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: A matter of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Is there something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Yes. Withholding evidence. Covering up two
murders. And no one’s worried. If me or one of the people in Jamestown
did that they’d be in the hell house with the key thrown away. It seems
the church is able to do whatever it wants.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: You’re right to not like it. It is
political.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: We thought we could find Brother Edgar
ourselves. We were wrong. But now any debate is pointless.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The greatest danger is if this were to become
public knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Wouldn’t want anyone criticizing the church I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: It’s more than that Captain. This is about
prejudice, or rather the nature of it. As a female surely you would
understand.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: How many other Captains in this borough are
female?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: None?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: How are your actions judged, the same or
differently from the men.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Differently.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Exactly. If a white man kills, then he is
just a killer. If a black man kills, then all black men are suspect.
That is the nature of prejudice. Those who are different are grouped
together. If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are
suspect, because we are different. And then what would this world be
like, if there was no hope?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Alright then. So what do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: First, there is something you should
hear.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Ok, ok, quiet down.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Gentlemen, there’s no other way to put it. We
have only 2 days to find the suspect.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There’s no chance. Not a hope in hell.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s right. We don’t even know where to
begin.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What you are about to hear will not leave
this room. Everyone understand? Jones?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I would suggest anyone with a weak stomach
leave now.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: This is Brother Silus.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Thank you Captain. Could we have the
plate?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3 weeks ago, he
was a trusted and talented theologian and scientist.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: What’d he do?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He was personally responsible for developing
the most recent influenza antivirals. It is because of him that most of
you are alive today. His behavior appeared normal. Next.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The victims. John Anderson. Julie Danes.
Tanya Garfield. All in their early 20’s, but beyond that no obvious
connection. Next.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: There is no precedent for Brother Edgar’s
behavior. No Brother has ever taken a human life, not in the 300 years
since we began. Not one. Our role has been to preserve and maintain the
human life. Not take it.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Next he’ll be wanting an fucking medal.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: What I am saying to you is that Brother
Edgar’s behavior is aberrant. We</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: don’t understand it. And therefore it’s
difficult to predict. The only thing we know is where he will strike
next.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>man on the tape</strong>: Please. Please don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>man on the tape</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I said shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Jones, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Why are we listening to this?!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Good. Now you’re quiet.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Did you hear that Silus? I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: The next one will be tomorrow. There is a
square, Bridge Square it’s called. I will take the next one from there.
You should try harder this time. Please try harder…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He sent this to you. Specifically.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: We share the same mother. There is a
bond.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: There will be two teams. Frank, I want you
and Abernathy up in the buildings around Bridge Square.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’ll lead the other team with Dominic, Jones
and Queen’s Imperial Guard in support. No guns, batons only.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You heard me. He’s to be taken alive.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He will come.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Ok. We’ll sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: This is a dud.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah Lil’.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Check each floor again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You heard her. Once more for the empire.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Shoo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Lil’! Lil’!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s on the sixth floor! He’s on the sixth
floor!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Police. Get back inside. Get back.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Lil’.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’re so strong.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Lilly!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh shit shit.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Lilly’s hurt. She’s hurt!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: He’s in the ventilation shaft!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She’s dying! She’s fucking dying!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Get away from her!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Get away or I’ll stick you!</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Do you want me to save her?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: She is dying.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall back, fall
back…</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: He’s getting away!!</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He’s going up.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He killed Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Antibiotics. They say it’s like an animal
bite.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I want to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: We all caught Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I don’t mean that. The blood, they say it
saved my life. Is it true that people who go to church are given your
blood?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Sometimes the rituals call for it. Some say
they have visions from it. That it restores their health.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: So smooth.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Healed already.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: In some ways my body is like a human embryo.
The cells regenerate quickly. It is why we live so long. Will someone
come for you? Your family?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I don’t have one. Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Influenza. My husband was quick. But my
daughter, Mary, her little body fought it for a long time. So I just
waited. Hoped. But then you realize how cruel hope is. And you just want
it to end. Not to stop her suffering, but to stop my own.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Do we seem pathetic to you?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No. Fragile. Worn down by nature. But you
fight back.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Yes. We’re good at that.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I think yours will be a good life to watch,
Lilly. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Nicely done. You’re more human than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>52a ext</strong>: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY-
Establisher 52A</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Silus. You know Professor Liepsky.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Is the brace necessary?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: He decapitated a guard as they brought him
in. Even though he was sedated. He said he will drink us all dry.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Insane then.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: He’s become infected.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Go on, Brother Silus will soon be part of
the inner circle of the Brotherhood. He should know this.</p>
<p><strong>56 int: brotherhood building, bio containment ward -
56</strong>: DAY- Establisher</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: If she wasn’t restrained she
would try to kill you. Don’t worry, it’s only transmissible through
their blood. We designed it that way.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Designed?</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: Genetically designed. Edgar was
experimenting with the virus that created you. It was sanctioned by the
government.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Since when do they sanction such things?</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: Since not one Brother has been
born in 70 years. And never a female of your kind from which we could
breed. And we need to breed more Brothers. You give the world hope. To
the people you’re like gods walking the earth.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: This is what Edgar was doing Silus. Trying
to genetically control the birth of Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: And Edgar was successful. Each of
these women carried a Brother, for a time. But, the virus… changed. Most
of them have died and these will die soon.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: And Edgar may be the first
Brother to ever die.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: Before that, his brain will
wither like these women. Containment will be the issue.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The police officer. Lilly. Did he infect her
with this?</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: No. She was lucky. But it is in
Edgar’s blood. It always will be.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Hello my Brother.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Do you like what they’ve done for me
Silus?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: You are sick. We will help you if we can.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Help me? I am being what I was meant to be.
How can you help me from that? Or do you want to tame me? Brainwash me?
Animal or vegetable, are those the two choices, Silus?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I want to share the feeling with you. To feel
their blood flow until every last drop is yours, until that weak,
pointless little pump finally stops.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: The one I had, the police woman. She was so
strong. I found it hard to leave her.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: She survived.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Good. I will have her again.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: You won’t touch her.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’ve chosen to watch over her. You want her
don’t you? I can see it in your eyes. You are like me.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I will pray for your cure, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I wont be able to forgive you for this you
know? Not ever. In fact, when I get out of here…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I will make you see. I will show you the way.
I will see you drink your little police woman right through.</p>
<p><strong>59 omitted 59</strong>: 55</p>
<p><strong>console operator 1</strong>: I don’t like it when he does
that.</p>
<p><strong>console operator 2</strong>: You stop that or we’ll use the
gas!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Take them away from here.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You don’t feel like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Now my girls, anyone hungry?</p>
<p><strong>64 omitted 64</strong>: 57</p>
<p><strong>console operator</strong>: If you don’t stop that we’ll use
the gas. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I knocked.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You nearly gave me a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s this then?</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: My apartment was condemned, keep your hair
on, what’s left of it.</p>
<p><strong>tv presenter</strong>: …the ascension through the ranks of
the Church has been fast for Brother Silus. He will now be the highest
ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the Brotherhood. This is
largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza
pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Isn’t he amazing?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: A saint.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>tv presenter</strong>: You have been an opponent of those who
want an easing in the ban on genetic research.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tv presenter</strong>: They would say you’re denying
legitimate research into a science that would change the world.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The church does not deny the potential. Only
the motivations of those who want to exploit it. And the fact that we
understand so little of its power.</p>
<p><strong>tv presenter</strong>: With the elimination of influenza, are
we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Disease is part of nature, it will always be
a part of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: How true.</p>
<p><strong>tv presenter</strong>: Brother Silus’ confirmation ceremony
will be held today in the sacred Chapel of St. Augustine where all the
Brotherhood will gather.</p>
<p><strong>thru thru</strong>: 69 69</p>
<p><strong>console operator</strong>: I turned off the lights to try and
calm him…</p>
<p><strong>console operator</strong>: We gassed him as usual. We waited
10 minutes. He must have held his breath.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: The blood flows, through them, to us and
we preserve them, preserve the blood we are bound to protect.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Let the blood be one and the two races join,
as the Perfect Creature.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Today my brother enters the history books,
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor liepsky</strong>: Move back!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Tonight all the Brothers will be with him. A
perfect day for me to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>and and</strong>: 74 74</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You won’t be taking any more calls today.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Now he carries this thing out into the
world. Can you imagine what will happen if he infects others? Or if the
experiments were known.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The question becomes what will he do next? He
said he would kill us all. But especially the police officer. Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Come on governor, you going to pay me or
not?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Soon enough my cherub. I’ve not finished
with you yet.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’ve been ripping me off! I should blow
your dirty little brains out!</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Police! Put the gun down now!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: It’s ok. I’m complying officer, see.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Put the gun on the ground and step away!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: He’s crazy! Fucking crazy!</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Wait! Down! Right now, down on the
ground!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’m getting wet now.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Put your hands behind your back.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Sure. Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Nice to meet you again.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You brought me the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Does it matter, one’s as good as the
next?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You promised me some of that.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: What do you see Freddy. Visions? Can you see
your future?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Don’t be a greedy little pig Freddy. You have
to earn more.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: We have more to do.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Police. Put your hands where I can see
them!</p>
<p><strong>parishoner</strong>: Holy brother, please…</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He’s harmless. Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>parishoner</strong>: Forgive me. I’ve offended you…</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No. You are divine. It is the world that
offends me.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Brother Silus. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went to see,
found this. One witness. A prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She identified this lovely citizen. We
thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. I guess we were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: It is Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And now he’s got Steph. Why does he want
her?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: She is not what he was after.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Steph was staying with me. She was wearing my
coat. It was me he was after. Wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Yes. He will come for you Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Right, then we put you somewhere safe and set
up this place. Shooters on the roofs. And when he comes we blow his
fucking brains out.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He will know. He will see and hear it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It has to be me. That’s what he wants. It’s
the only chance Steph’s got.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What are you talking about, she’s probably
dead already…</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Jones! And we can’t make it too hard. He has
to be able to get in. He can’t suspect anything.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That’s the way it will be. I’m the bait.</p>
<p><strong>steph</strong>: Help me. Please, I’m sick. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Don’t fucking touch me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Where’ve you gone now?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What is it? Jones?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Get back here, Lilly!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Cover me.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You saved me…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: When will you admit it. You’re just like
me.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Maybe you need some encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Get him down.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Lilly, wait! Damn you. Lilly!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: If he escapes then Steph is dead. Just follow
me when you can, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: The little policewoman.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I said don’t move. Where is she, where’s the
girl?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Oh, I’ve killed her already. Essentially.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Has he tasted you yet, little
policewoman?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: He’s just the same as me, you know it, you
can feel it too.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He’s nothing like you.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: We will see. You will be my tool.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut:</strong>: 80</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You happy now?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You scared the shit out of me. Hey, the
police woman. She’s real sick. To tell the truth I don’t feel so hot
myself.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I want you to take her and put her where
they’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But I’m sick. She’s given me something…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: What have I said to you?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I hate arguments.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Stephanie Richards, you just brought her
in.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Thank god you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Will she recover?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No. Containment is the issue now. She is…
insane. And we’ve had more cases, 10 in the last hour.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What is this? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: It comes from Edgar. He has shared his blood
with them.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’re telling me that he’s out there
spreading this around?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He’ll give it to Lilly!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Jones! Back off.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: This is spreading.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Brother Silus?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: That’s it, Lilly’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No. He will keep her alive.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: So that I will come for him. That’s what he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: It says, “Everything flows from me. My
blood will change the world.” What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>thru thru</strong>: 103 103</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: It almost sounds like children playing, don’t
you think?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I looked at your body. You have borne a
child.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Did you abandon it? Your kind are good at
that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Why don’t you just kill me?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Kill me!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I can see why he likes you. But I have a
better use for you. To save you, Silus will take my blood. Join me.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: The world is insane. I am better than you.
But they force me to serve you. Does that happen in a sane world? Forced
to watch you waste the most precious thing you have. Life.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Do you know what they do to us when we are
born? They take us from our mothers. Force us into a life of loneliness,
and denial. Can you imagine a life like that?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You don’t have to do this. You can change
things.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You have reminded me of something.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I must search out my mother, if she still
lives. And kill her for what she did.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Some say this plague is the result of
genetic experimentation, by the Brothers. Do you have a comment?</p>
<p><strong>health official</strong>: We’re asking everyone to stay in
their homes in the sections of Jamestown now under quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: There are reports of residents being shot
trying to escape the quarantine zone. Is that true? They say the Queen
has left the city… Is this martial law?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: We’ve blocked off this section, and here,
containing the Jamestown slums.</p>
<p><strong>and and</strong>: 109 109</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Do you like the world I am making for us,
Silus? I haven’t had your little policewoman yet. But I will soon.
You’ll just have to find me. You know where I am. Everything flows from
me. Remember that…</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: The infection is spreading. Each day he
shares his blood with more of them. Even though they are locked in their
homes.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He is somewhere in the quarantine zone. I
will find him.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Clear. So very clear your eyes. The way
they were when you were born. There will be no search.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No search?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: The Queen has instructed the government to
evacuate the city around the quarantine zone. In another day they will
take action.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: What kind of action?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Eradication. Of everything within the
area. They will burn it all. Including Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: And the innocents there, who are not
infected?</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: It is a necessary step. We cannot let this
escape.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: Is it the policewoman? Is this affecting
your thinking? There is no love for our kind Silus. Only service.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: We have done this. Released this thing into
the world. We have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. I won’t
do it again.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: There is no debate. They will be
sacrificed, so the rest will be pure.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: This policeman, Jones. He talked to the
press. Told them this came from Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: There are members of the inner circle who
question the way you have handled this. Blame you for this man’s
actions. I have made it clear that you will fix this. That you will
silence him.</p>
<p><strong>augustus</strong>: These are hard things we do. But you must
think of the greater good. And of your own future.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Come on then…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I want to help you. They know you talked to
the press.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: They can fuck off. For that matter, so can
you.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’d be the last person I’d trust.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I saw you. Remember. Watching Lilly, when she
was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Maybe you’re just like your Brother. Maybe
you’re helping him. Now there’s a thought.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Do you know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’ve changed. Not the outside. But inside.
I know you. You know what, I can see myself?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Coffee’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You know where I am. Everything flows from
me…</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Do you have a map?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There’s the quarantine zone. It’s a pit.
Slums.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: The water supply. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There, all the old suburbs are supplied by
their own artesian wells. Mineral springs. That’s why it hasn’t broken
out of Jamestown, it’s the water. Jamestown’s water.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: He is there, with Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’ll never get in, they’ve circled the
whole borough.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell
them about the water. Tell them what the government will do.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’re dead after this. You know that?
Whatever happens.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Watch for me, Officer Jones.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: Who has done this, Brother?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: We have. To our shame.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: I have something to show you.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: It is a miracle my Brother. She is a
female, the first of our kind.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: She must be protected.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: I would ask for your help Brother. The Church
can no longer be trusted…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: He’s coming little one. He’s coming for
you.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Hello! I’m down here. Silus…</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: It is a maze down here. But given time, that
thing will find her. Do things to her. I’ll show you where she is, if
you take some.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’re almost there anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Silus…</p>
<p><strong>and and</strong>: 124 124</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: If I burn the skin from your face, I wonder
how that would be. If you looked like a monster…</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Is there something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: There is something very precious. You must
take it, keep it secret. Don’t let them touch it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>silus</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: The first female of her kind. The first
daughter given to us.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: Come. Before they find her.</p>
<p><strong>priest 2</strong>: We must go.</p>
<p>****: For me, everything has changed now. Because of Silus I see the
world through new eyes.</p>
<p>****: Now I see hope, and I see a child, the first female of her
kind.</p>
<p>****: Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted after all, because it time
this child will truly change our world.</p>
