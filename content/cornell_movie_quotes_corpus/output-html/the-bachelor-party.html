<p><strong>exterior. stuyvesant town housing project – day.</strong>:
Under the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, capturing
the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses. Seven o’clock
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>interior. charlie’s bedroom</strong>: The bedroom of a
two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing project. It is early
morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark. CAMERA moves
slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which Charlie and
Helen Samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They
are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other.
One of Helen’s pajama-clad legs projects from under the light covers. We
close in on Charlie’s sleeping face.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You think it’s too early to call my
mother?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello, Ma, did I wake you up? This is Helen….
Well, I’ll be going to work, and I wanted to get ahold of you before I
left. I called you last night. Where were you and Pop anyway? I kept
calling you every half hour up till one o’clock…. Oh, yeah? Did you have
a nice time? …</p>
<p><strong>camera slowly moves in for closeup</strong>: of Charlie in
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Well, listen, Ma, I got something to
tell you. I’m pregnant…. Yeah, pregnant…. Of course I’m sure. I’ve got
the report back from the laboratory…. No, you wouldn’t know him, Doctor
Axelrod…. Second month. He says I can expect the baby in February….
Well, Grandma, act a little excited, will you? … You bet I’m
excited….</p>
<p><strong>closeup of charlie</strong>: He is not excited. If anything
he is miserable. His bowed head rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares
abstractedly ahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of
resignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back
to its previous abjection.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the kitchen – half hour later</strong>: Helen,
dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two cups of instant
coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups. The
toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf of white bread is open on the
cupboard shelf. Finished with pouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan
back on the stove and comes out into the dining area. The dinette table
is covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large
accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers, a ruler,
several pencils and a pen, an ash tray glutted with cigarettes, a cup
and saucer.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you need any of this or can I take them
off the table?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll clean that up in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How late were you up last night?</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: About two.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the bedroom</strong>: Charlie standing by the
window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a
chair and putting them into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the
bedroom window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in,
whitening Charlie’s face. After he has pocketed his odds and ends, he
moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things,
there are several textbooks and an opened notebook. He stands a moment
looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as
he commits some of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook
back to check something and then goes back to the previous page. Now he
opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers. The drawer
contains wisps of his wife’s stockings and other feminine things. He
finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in
his pocket and closing the dresser drawer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m taking five bucks from your drawer.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the dining area</strong>: Helen is seated at the
dinette table, sipping coffee and reading yesterday’s newspaper. There
are two cups of coffee on the table.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A guy in my office is getting married, and
I got clipped four bucks for his wedding present.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who’s getting married?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold. I told you about him. The guy with
the sick mother.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: whether he needs a The rest of the guys are
giving him a bachelor party tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you want to go, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I got class tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What have you got – cost accounting?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think you ought to take off a night. You
ought to go, have a little fun for yourself. I think you need that. You
go to work all day, you go to school all night. You can miss one night,
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, these bachelor parties get kind of wild
sometimes. The whole philosophy is: it’s the groom’s last night of
freedom. So it gets kind of wild sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s a good philosophy to start a marriage
with.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, a bunch of guys get together, they
like to tear up the town a little.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think you oughta go, Charlie. I know you’re
upset about the baby.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not upset about the baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on, Charlie. I know how you feel.
Listen, you don’t have to pretend you’re excited about the baby. We
weren’t exactly planning on a baby right now …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not upset about the baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s a shock. I had some bad days before I
told you. I said: “Oh, boy, that’s all we need. A baby.” Then I said to
myself: “If I’m having a baby, I’m having a baby. That’s all there is to
it.” And I like the idea. We’re going to have a family, Charlie. I like
the idea.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, give me a couple of days to get used
to the idea. I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know you will, Charlie. That’s why I think
you ought to go to this bachelor party tonight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t want to go to this bachelor
party.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m sorry I yelled.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I better get going. Kenny’s probably
waiting for me now. I’m sorry I yelled like that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you sorry about? Don’t I yell at you
all the time?</p>
<p><strong>interior. local platform eastside irt subway</strong>: An
express train hurtles southward. We see it flashing by through the
concrete pillars of the subway.</p>
<p><strong>irt express hurtling southward</strong>: Charlie and another
young man, named Kenneth, are seated in a crowded subway car. People are
standing tightly in the aisles. Kenneth is an amiable young man of
thirty-odd. He has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession
to the August heat. Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. He has two
notebooks and a battered text in his lap. He is reading the text. Two
young white-collar workers on their way to work. They ride along
silently for a moment. Kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a
full-busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him,
holding on to a strap. It is summertime, and the girls all wear light
summer frocks. There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You going to Arnold’s bachelor party?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t think so, Kennie.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I got two classes tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, I was going to go, but I think I
better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she’s been acting
up again lately. She’s got some kind of allergy, the doctors don’t know
what.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: These bachelor parties get kind of wild
sometimes. Eddie Watkins is making all the arrangements. He’s probably
got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, boy, he really lives it up, don’t he?
Did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week? Boy,
sometimes I wish I was a bachelor. Well, you know what I mean. I never
seem to get out of the house any more, you know what I mean? About once
a week, I go to the movies. We never even see the whole picture. My wife
starts worrying about the kids. My youngest kid, the girl, she’s got
some kind of rash. We don’t know what it is. I never seem to see anybody
any more. Do you know how long it is since I’ve seen Willie Duff? I
haven’t seen Willie in about six months. My wife can’t stand his wife.
You ever seen her, Willie’s wife?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I didn’t know Willie too well.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Boy, wait’ll you have kids, boy. You’ll
never get out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Helen’s pregnant now.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Oh, that’s wonderful, Charlie, that’s
wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, there’s a guy down there, trying to
pick up a girl down there.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Were you with us about eight years ago when
I picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in Paterson, New
Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, you were there. You were with that
girl from Brooklyn. We just came from Palisades Amusement Park, and we
were driving Frankie Klein’s girl home, and the car broke down right in
the middle of Route One.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: And Frankie opened up the hood and the
water cap blew right up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And the cop came over …</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: That’s right, the cop. He thought Frankie
shot off a gun….</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: He was going to pull us all in. Oh,
man!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Frankie, he was funny.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Oh, that was a lot of fun, those days.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, they were.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, this guy’s making out all right. She’s
giving him the eye now.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: window at the passing Where are we now,
Prince Street? I bet you he picks her up before we hit Chambers
Street.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Boy, I’m bushed today. I was up till two
o’clock last night on this thing here. I’m getting to be a nervous
wreck. I snarled at Helen this morning. I think this whole night school
business is getting me down.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I don’t see how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Neither do I. I thought I was through with
it. The plan was for me to quit work and go to college full time and
cram through in a year or so. But now we got this kid coming, and
Helen’s going to have to quit her job, and that sets me back where I
started from. Another five years of this, summers included.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I couldn’t do it, man, I’ll tell you that.
I wish I could, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, what am I griping about? This is the
life I picked out for myself. But it’s a grind, boy, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>young fellow</strong>: Excuse me, can you tell me how to get
to the Nassau Street exit?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Well … well, at the top of the stairs, you’ll
see all the signs.</p>
<p><strong>young fellow</strong>: Are you getting off here?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>young fellow</strong>: Well, I’ll follow you then. That’ll be
easier, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. the office</strong>: We look down on the
bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown Manhattan
area around Pine Street. It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold
eleven desks. But you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller
offices on the floor. You get the feeling that this company occupies
three or four floors of this building. Despite the size of the office,
it has a cluttered look. Each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the
impedimenta of the bookkeeper – the pens and pencils, the adding
machine, the telephone. Some of the desks have typewriters. Along the
walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large
worksheets and thick ledgers. At the far end of the room, there is a row
of windows, but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent
lights on all day. They are on now. There are two middle-aged women
standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy-set balding man in
his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard
at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hiya, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hiya, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Walter, what time do you come in in the
mornings? You’re making us all look lousy, you know that? I get the
feeling sometimes, you stay here overnight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold in yet?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He starts his vacation today. He’s getting
married Sunday, you know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, the doctor was over last night.
Brought over the X rays; brought over the allergy tests. Brought over a
bill for sixty-eight dollars. I said to him: “Doctor, you’re a young
man, professional, highly educated, four years of college, two years of
premedical training, several years of interning, of residency. If you’re
so smart, how can you charge me sixty-eight dollars? One thing they
apparently didn’t teach you in medical school. You can’t get blood from
a stone.”</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: So what’s wrong with you, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s wrong? I have to go to Arizona,
that’s what’s wrong. I have asthma. When I was a kid, they called it hay
fever, and you carried a bag around your neck. Asafetida. Now, they call
it asthma, and you have to go to Arizona. I said to him: “Doctor, you’re
a professional man, four years of college, premedical school, Bellevue,
several diplomas. Answer me a question. Who’s going to pay for Arizona?”
I said to him: “Doctor,” I said, “perhaps you have the illusion I am the
Aga Khan. I have a bearing about me, perhaps, that misleads you to
believe I have blood ties with the Whitneys and the Rockefellers. This
isn’t true.” Arizona. Did you ever hear of such nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: How serious is it, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Serious. Nothing serious. I have hay fever,
I sneeze a couple of times. The idiot told my wife I have to go to
Arizona, and she wouldn’t leave me alone all night. She’s already
packing the bags. I said: “For heaven’s sakes, you listen to doctors,
we’ll all be dead.” My son, Harold, believe me, he’s going to be a
doctor. That’s some racket, boy. Sixty-eight dollars.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You better get to work. Hey, Charlie, that
was the bell. I think Flaherty is here this morning. We’ll all be fired
today. I have a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the office – twenty minutes later</strong>: We look
down on the bookkeeping department. All the desks are occupied but two.
There are six women and our three men. The office is silent with
industry, everybody’s head bent over his desk. There is the occasional
punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You fellows going to Arnold’s party
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: No, I’m not going, are you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Eddie already hooked me for four bucks
for Arnold’s present. This dinner is going to cost another couple of
good dollars.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It looks like nobody’s going to Arnold’s
bachelor party.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You ain’t going?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Eddie’s going to be mad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I told Eddie last week I couldn’t make it.
I’ve got school. Eddie’s a bachelor. It’s all right for him to go
rooting around town, picking up girls.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, you get married you give that kind of
thing up.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, Charlie says Eddie has a whole bunch
of chorus girls lined up for us tonight.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I didn’t say that. I just said that if I
knew Eddie, we’d probably wind up with some of his crazy girl
friends.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I don’t know where he gets all these girls.
He’s a screwy looking jerk.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you see that blonde who was up here
looking for him last week?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah. He told me she was a television
actress. I think I saw her once on “Studio One.” She was in a coal mine
with some stir-crazy coalminer who was trying to strangle her with a
necktie.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’d like to strangle her with a necktie.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Now, Walter, an old married man like you,
with asthma and everything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I get real jealous of Eddie sometimes. He’s
as free as a bird. Did you see that convertible he’s got?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, he really banged it up I hear.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You ought to see the old heap I’ve got. He
walks out of here on payday, he can spend the whole works on having
himself a good time. I walk out of here, and I got three kids and a
wife, all of them with their palms out. I lost two bucks playing poker
at my house last week. It was an economic catastrophe. My wife didn’t
sleep all night.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s late again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’ll be twenty minutes late again. If
Flaherty walked in now, he’d fire him. If that ever happened to me, I
think I’d kill myself. What does Eddie care? So he scrambles around for
another job. Flaherty told me last week I had too many days off. I told
him I was sick in bed. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi, Eddie, you’re early today, only twenty
minutes late, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Flaherty come in yet?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mary, give me an outside line…. the number in
the phone book again, Hello, is this Leathercraft on Madison Avenue? …
This is Mr. Watkins. I was in about a week ago. I ordered a military set
and a wallet. They were supposed to be ready yesterday…. Yes, please,
would you? … his pockets while he waits, finds a piece of paper, Yeah, a
military set and a wallet….</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is that what we bought poor Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s right. The following inscriptions
should be on them: On the military set: “To Arnold: Best wishes on your
marriage from Alice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn, Jeanette with two t’s,
Kenneth, Lucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and Flaherty.” Now on the wallet …
Yeah, what? …. Yeah, that’s right – Flaherty. Now, on the wallet, the
following inscription: “To my Best Friend Arnold from his Best Man
Eddie.” … No, to my best friend Arnold. … That’s right. “From his best
man Eddie” … Now, can I come in at lunch and pick them up? …</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s this, Jeanette?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s from finance, don’t ask me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mary, give me the Hotel Westmore. Circle
7-0598.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This isn’t for me – it’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Now who owes me on the presents? Charlie, you
owe me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I gave you four bucks yesterday….</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I owe you, Eddie. I’ll pay you tomorrow,
payday.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Miss Frances Kelley, please. I think it’s
room 417….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: of the women in Hey, Evelyn, you owe me four
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: All right. I know.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hello, Frances, this is Eddie…. All right,
wait a minute. Give me a chance to explain…. I know I woke you up…. All
right, let me tell you. You know I’m supposed to be the best man at this
fellow Arnold’s wedding. So I called him up last night because I didn’t
know whether I was supposed to wear tuxedo or tails. Well, he didn’t
know either, so he said: “Come on over to my girl’s house with me
tonight. They’re making all the arrangements for the wedding now.” So I
called you and left a message at the desk saying I couldn’t get over
till about ten o’clock…. All right! That’s what I’m going to explain! …
Thank you. against his chest and looks at his colleagues with air of a
man being tried just a little too much. Returns receiver to his ear, All
right, so I had to go over to Arnold’s girl’s house with Arnold last
night. Well, there was about thirty people there, and, man, you never
saw such a crazy mess. There was this little bald-headed guy there. He’s
the bride’s uncle. He’s come all the way down from Boston with his whole
family to go to the wedding. The only trouble was, he wasn’t invited.
Well, this crazy uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he starts shaking me by
the lapels. So I said: “What do you want from me? I ain’t the groom! I’m
just trying to find out whether I’m supposed to wear tuxedo or tails.” a
laugh. Eddie breaks Funny, huh? … Look, Frances. I have to go to work
now. I’m calling you from the office. How about letting me make this up
to you? I’ll take you out to dinner Saturday night…. I can’t make it
tonight. The bachelor party’s tonight…. All right, Saturday night…. It’s
a date…. S’help me…. I swear, right on time. Eight-thirty, okay? … Okay,
we’ll have a ball. Goodbye, go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What did I just tell that girl, Saturday
night?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mary, give me Columbus 5-1098…. What do you
mean personal calls! These are business calls! Well, stop listening to
other people’s conversations…. What have you got, stock in the company?
Columbus 5-1098.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Listen, Eddie, I don’t think I can go
tonight. My father-in-law’s in from Akron, Ohio, and—-</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hello, who is this, Mrs. Stebbins? … This is
Eddie, Mrs. Stebbins. I wonder if I can talk to Muriel…. Could I speak
to her? … Thank you….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, I can’t make
it Saturday night…. I’m all loused up with this wedding I’m supposed to
be the best man at…. We have to rehearse the ceremony. You’d think they
were getting married on television…. Yes, sweetie, why don’t I call you
Monday. Maybe, we’ll work out something before you go back to
California…. All right, sweetie, good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what do you say? I’m going to call
Louie and make a reservation for a table for tonight. Who’s coming and
who isn’t? Walter, you’re coming, right? It won’t cost you more than
three-fifty for the whole meal. What do you say, Walter? You only live
once.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s right. You only live once.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: All right, I’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Kennie?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, I’ll get out of the house for a
change.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How about you, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t think so, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Ah, come on, Charlie, you got to bust loose
every now and then. We’ll have a couple of drinks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mary, give me an outside line and don’t give
me no trouble…. Chickering 4-5099.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Come on, Charlie, it’s a short life, believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: Hello, hello, Louie? Is this Louie? …
Louie, this is Eddie Watkins. I’d like to reserve a table for four for
tonight…. For four …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Eddie …</p>
<p><strong>eddie’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Louie, make that five…. Five guys … Yeah, a
bachelor party …</p>
<p><strong>exterior. street – night</strong>: Thirteenth Street off
Sixth Avenue not so blary and lit up as the main drags, but traffic is
heavy, and there are lots of people on the sidewalks. There are a number
of restaurants dotting the street with their little striped awnings and
modest neons. If we are on our toes, we notice one neon that reads:
“LOUIE’S.”</p>
<p><strong>interior. louie’s restaurant</strong>: The entire interior
isn’t too much to show, really. It’s a small restaurant, but it is
packed. Waiters scurry here and there. People jammer and jab. Hustle and
bustle. In background, we can pick out our bachelor party, five men now,
clustered around a table, yakking it up.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Three hundred pounds! Isn’t she kind of
fat? No, man, tall! Hey, waiter! Waiter!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … so we were stationed right outside Paris,
about eight miles, a town called Chatou …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … hey, Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … so the first night, a whole bunch of us
swiped a jeep out of the motor court. We had a feller there who was a
tech sergeant in the motor court. Oh, what a character he was! He used
to get loaded every night on that vanilla extract.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you want, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Charlie, did I ever tell you about the
time I was stationed at Buckley Field in Denver, and I picked up this
girl in Lakeside Amusement Park?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, Eddie, listen to this story I’m telling
Charlie. Hey, Arnold, I’m telling Charlie about the time me and that
crazy tech sergeant from the motor court got loaded on vanilla extract
and went to Paris … Hey, Kenneth …</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: When do the Giants come back from their
road trip, does anybody know?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, let’s give out the presents now.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, Kenneth, listen to this story. I was
stationed outside of Paris, about eight miles …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Oh, that Paris! I was there for two days!
Clubs! You had to beat the women off with clubs! …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What …? Oh, it’s a bachelor party – this
guy’s getting married.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Listen, I want to give the presents …</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, let me tell you what happened …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, you know what was a great town for
women, Hamburg!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hamburg! Clubs! Clubs! You had to beat them
off with clubs! Hey, waiter – who’s our waiter?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Arnold, enjoying yourself?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The first night I was in Hamburg, two
Frauleins come walking right in the barracks. So I said to the
lieutenant …</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The best fighting outfit in the whole
fighting army was the fighting Hundred and Fourth Infantry Division,
General Terry Allen commanding!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, now that we got that settled….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m with you, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: We believe you, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’d like to make a little speech to our guest
of honor and mutual friend, Arnold Craig. Arnold, a bunch of us down the
office, the girls too, all chipped in, and we got you a couple of small
gifts….</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: These are the gag gifts.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s see, what’s this one? Oh, yeah. Arnold,
we figured Louise might be very sleepy on your wedding night, so we
thought you might want something to keep you warm.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What is it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a hot-water bottle!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Okay, Walter, okay.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, did you see that? Hey, he bought him a
hot-water bottle for his wedding night. Hey, that’s funny …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Eddie, you should have bought him an
ice pack for after tonight.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Walter, take it easy…. Now, this one, Arnold,
this one is something to keep you busy on cold winter nights.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This ought to be good.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look at Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, these are funny. Who bought these? You
buy these, Eddie? These are funny. You got a good sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, did you guys see that? Hey, did you
guys see that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Walter, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Eddie got a good sense of humor, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Boy, old Walter is crocked.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Listen, I want to thank you. Really. I
really want to thank you fellows.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We haven’t got to the serious presents yet,
Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, in all seriousness, Arnold, seriously,
I don’t know why you picked me to be your best man, but I am deeply
honored. I guess it’s because we’re both Dodger fans, and I’m going to
miss you at next Tuesday’s night game when the Pittsburgh Pirates invade
Ebbets Field. We always had a lot of fun together, and, seriously,
Arnold, in all seriousness, good luck on your wedding, but see if you
can’t get out of the house occasionally, see a night game or even a
Sunday doubleheader with your old buddy, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: two neatly wrapped Well, anyway, in all
seriousness, here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office
and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, I just want to thank you fellows. I
don’t know what to say. I just want to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Open the presents, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I will. I just want to say, Eddie, that when
the Pirates invade Ebbets Field next Tuesday night, I’m going to be
sitting right there in Section 37 there right with you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ll be on your honeymoon next Tuesday,
Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Gee, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold, you’re getting married Sunday, did
you forget?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look at him blush.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: No, I didn’t forget. It’s just that … Gee,
that’s right. Sunday. What’s today, Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Boy, it’s here, isn’t it? I guess I’ve been
running around so much the last couple of weeks, I guess the wedding
snuck up on me.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I think Arnold’s having a little buck
fever. Does anyone know what our waiter looks like?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know who didn’t want to chip in for
Arnold’s presents? …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold’ll be all right. Have a drink,
Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I had my basic training in Camp Croft, South
Carolina, near Spartanburg.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I was at Maxwell Field, what a desert.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter, what ever happened when you and
that tech sergeant from the motor pool got loaded on vanilla
extract?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What tech sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter, you’re crocked. Open up the
presents – see what you got.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, are you our waiter? Bring us some ice.
I got him – I got our waiter!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: It was sure nice of you fellows.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, man, we’re having a ball!</p>
<p><strong>exterior. eighth street – night</strong>: We look down on
Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. It is eight thirty at night. It is a
fairly active and well-lit street, bright with neons and movie marquees
and lit-up shops. Our five carousers are marching down the sidewalk,
that is four of them are on the sidewalk. Walter can’t quite decide
whether he wants to walk on the sidewalk or in the street. He keeps
hopping in and out between the parked cars, running to catch up when he
falls behind. They are all feeling pretty good. Arnold is singing in a
wavering baritone:</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: De-Witt C-l-i-n-t-o-n Boom! Clinton! Oh,
Cli-inton! Ever to theeeee!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Fairest of high schools …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How did he ever get on this alma mater
kick?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … Give her three times three Oh, fellows …
Rah! Rah! Rah!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Long may we cherish thee Faithful we’ll be.
Clinton, oh, Clinton For you and me … Da-da-da-da-da … Crash through
that line of blue And send the backs around the end.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There he goes with those fullbacks again.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Rah! Rah! Rah!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Where we going? Eddie’s place to see
movies?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: What movies?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Boy, just wait till you see these movies!
Hey, Charlie, hey Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Who’s your beautiful friend, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Excuse me. My friend down there wants to
know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Where are you all from,
out-of-town?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Indiana. Isn’t that right, fellers? We’re
from Indiana, right?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Indiana! Indiana, man!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’re from the Hoosier State, ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Terre Haute! We’re from Terre Haute!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’re from Terre Haute, and we’ve come to
the big city looking for a good time, and we just don’t know what to do
with ourselves, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look at that Charlie operate.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Must be a convention in
town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’ve just come off the ranch there, honey,
and we’re just raring. Is that right, men? Are we raring?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’re raring, boy, we’re raring!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, Charlie, cut it out, will you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’re down here in Greenwich Village
looking for some wild bohemians. Do you happen to know any wild
bohemians?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: All right, fellows, enough’s
enough, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m something of a poet myself, ma’am.
Many’s the long night in the bunkhouse where I sat by myself and wrote
by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp. Could I read you some of my
poems, ma’am? I know they ain’t much, but they’re from the heart,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: You have a sense of humor, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re going great, man, don’t stop now.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where are you going, honey?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s going on in there, honey?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: There’s a party going on. I’m
not sure I’m invited myself, so I can’t really invite you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure you can.</p>
<p><strong>the hostess</strong>: How nice to see you, darling. Who are
your friends?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: I haven’t the vaguest idea. I
was ambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue by a tribe of the Terre Haute
Kiwanis.</p>
<p><strong>the hostess</strong>: hand in a sort of shooing motion at the
five men on Go away, you men. Go back to the Biltmore Hotel and put on
your red caps.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I always thought you city people were more
hospitable to us poor farm boys.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m sorry, miss. A friend of ours is
getting married here, and we’re just horsing around.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Why don’t you come back after
you get rid of your friends.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’ll be back!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Man, she likes you, man!</p>
<p><strong>the hostess</strong>: Now, you boys go away.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, what do you say, men, are we going to
this party, or aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Eddie. I thought you had some
movies you want to show us.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want to see movies for? You got
the real thing right here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Eddie, we’re married men here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come on, let’s crash this party. I’ve been to
these Greenwich Village parties. Man, they’re wild.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Come on, Eddie, let’s go up to your place,
see these movies.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: back to the others, Man, you were going
strong with that girl. You could have scored. She’s just waiting for
you. Go in after her.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Come on, Eddie. Let’s go see the
movies.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, I live about three blocks down.
You guys want to see movies, all right, let’s go see movies.</p>

intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets. Arnold has suddenly
become voluble and is gabbing away at him. CAMERA DOLLIES AROUND THEM

apartment, appointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the other
three men move in and out of view. Right now, we are concerned only with
Arnold and Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … we’re moving in with her mother and
father. I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. What do you think? We
haven’t got an apartment yet, and we figure we’ll live a year with her
folks, save on the rent, see?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Anybody want a bottle of beer?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: She’s a widow, and that bothers me a little.
I don’t know why. She’s two years older than me. I don’t know if you
know that. Her husband got killed in Korea. She’s a cousin of mine, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Who wants a bottle of beer?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll take a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, give me one.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: A third cousin, something like that. It’s
not good for cousins to marry, is it? What do you think of her? I know
she’s not terribly pretty, but I mean …</p>

was ever going to get married. I still don’t know how it happened….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, somebody turn off the lights.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, you know, you’ve got a nice place
here.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I was just taking her out. I didn’t know it
was so serious.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arnold, get out of the way, will you?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … We’re sitting in the car, so she says:
“Well, Arnold, we’ve been going together six months now. I think it’s
time we decided whether we were being serious.”</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, Eddie, you got it on the window.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I didn’t know it was so serious. I didn’t
even know we were going together. I just took her out every now and
then.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold, you’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Turn on the lights again, will you,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I forgot to loop it over this loop thing.</p>

just saw her this afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Arnold, have a bottle of beer. It’s not so
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Boy, I tell you. It’s for the rest of your
life when you get married. This is a big decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Does anybody seriously want to see these
movies?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I could be making a serious mistake.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arnold, you’re in the way again. Come on now.
All right, put off the lights.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Arnold, if this is the one I think it
is, there’s one part here I want you to see.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: boredom, but putting on This is for
kids.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Says he – putting on his glasses.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: “The Baseball Game.” That’s a nice title,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is the one, Arnold. There’s a guy in
here who looks just like Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Hey, she’s not bad. Usually, the girls in
these things look like dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A bunch of grown men …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got these pictures off my dentist. I don’t
know where be got them. There you are, Arnold, that’s you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, it does look like Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Doesn’t that look like Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Who’s looking at the guy?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold, you’ve got a great career ahead of
you.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: That girl looks like the girl Charlie
picked up just before.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Probably is.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That fellow there is not a bad actor.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Actor. You could play that part pretty easy
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I think the Daily News gave this one four
stars.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’d like to see this in Three-D.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, I’ll just watch one of them. Then, I
think I’ll just go home.</p>
<p><strong>interior. kitchen charlie and helen’s apartment</strong>:
Helen standing in front of the laundry part of the sink, doing her
private laundry. She has on a house smock and her sleeves are rolled up.
The doorbell rings. Helen takes a towel off the doorknob behind her and,
wiping her hands, comes down across the dining area to the front door.
She opens the door to admit a young woman, about eight years older than
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiya, Julie. I was beginning to think you
weren’t coming.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I was at my mother’s house. Did they call
you? They said they were going to call you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah, your mother was very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You should have seen my father. I said, “Pa,
you have another grandchild coming.” So he said, “Who?” So I said,
“Charlie.” So he said, “That little Helen?” So I said, “If it isn’t that
little Helen, Charlie better leave town.” So out came the beer. Well,
they’ve been after Charlie to have a baby for a long time now. I said,
“Pa, leave him alone. Let him get established before he saddles himself
with a baby.” Anyway, I want you to know joy reigns supreme in your
in-laws’ house. How’s Charlie taking it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Listen, let me make you a cup of tea or
something.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, no, I’ve been drinking beer for the last
two hours, celebrating your baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Soda, anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, honey, you go on with your wash. Is that
what you’re doing? When I had my first baby, Mike was ashamed to be seen
on the streets with me. Well, listen, he was interning at the time. We
needed a baby like a hole in the head. That’s why he’s a general
practitioner now, because of that baby. He was studying to be a surgeon.
He absolutely refused to admit I was pregnant. Even in my ninth month,
and I was as big as a house. He used to walk ten paces in front of me in
the street like he didn’t know who that woman with the belly was. Where
is Charlie anyway?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I told you he–</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, yeah. I wouldn’t let my Mike go on a
bachelor party.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are they going to do, get a little
drunk?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Are you kidding? What do you think these
bachelor parties are for, bachelors? This is for the married men. It’s a
good excuse to get drunk and find some girls.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Can you picture Charlie getting drunk and
picking up a girl? Charlie’s old sobersides. You should have seen what I
went through to get him to make a pass at me. He’s so sweet. Nobody
knows how really sweet he is, he’s so quiet all the time. My brother
died in September, he used to stay up with me till three, four o’clock
every night. I used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and
talk with me. I used to look at him talking there, and I used to think:
“What would I do without this sweet man here? I’d go crazy.” You know,
you like to be a little cynical sometimes, Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait’ll you’ve been married eleven years.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You like to talk about all the affairs
everybody’s husband is having. Do you know actually one woman whose
husband is actually playing around?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait’ll you’ve been married eleven years.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait’ll Charlie gets to be forty-two. My
Mike’s having an affair right now with one of his patients right now. We
don’t talk about it – don’t you, either, not even to Charlie. But Mike
knows I know about it. I even know the patient. A married woman with a
hyperthyroid problem. My Mike’s a good doctor with a pretty good
practice. The kids are crazy about him. But every now and then he has to
go out and get involved with a woman.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Listen, I will take a cup of tea if you’ve
got one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re kidding, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Would I kid about something like that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know why I told you. Don’t tell
anybody, not even Charlie. I don’t want the family to know. But this
woman isn’t the first one. I know that much. About three years ago, the
doorbell rings. I open the door. There’s a man there. He says: “Tell
your husband to stay away from my sister.” How would you like to open
the door and have somebody say that to you? I cried for two weeks. I
don’t know what to do about it, Helen. Should I bring it out in the open
with Mike or should I just keep my mouth shut like the other time?
Because he’s not going to leave me. Even if he doesn’t care about me, he
has his kids to think about. We married too young. That was our big
mistake. We married too young.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: a little from the suppressed emotion We
should have waited till he finished his internship. What kind of married
life is that? Twenty-two dollars a month he was earning. Every other
day, he had to sleep in the hospital. The first two years of our
marriage, we didn’t even see each other. And then I’m pregnant. He had
to quit, what do you think? He wanted to be a surgeon, he wound up being
a G.P. From that day he hated me. I had two other children by him, but
he hated me. He told me in just so many words. Why do you think I kept
telling you, Helen, why do you think I kept telling you: “Don’t have a
baby till Charlie finds himself.” It hurts! Even after eleven years, it
hurts!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you all right, Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m all right. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>interior. bachelor’s apartment</strong>: We are looking back
up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this
apartment. The room is absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from
the foyer. In this shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind
the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The room is
abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden
glare. They have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets
and loosened their ties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO
THE FLOOR to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an opened
fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of cigarettes, a cup and
saucer, somebody’s shoes, somebody’s jacket that has fallen off the back
of a chair. Over this we hear Walter’s voice:</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is that the last one?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ah, you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them
all.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah, they’re all alike.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know – I think the first one was
all right.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, I was so bored by the rest of them. I
nearly fell asleep during the last one.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You in the habit of sleeping with your eyes
open?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What time’s it about, anybody know?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I got a quarter to nine.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, it’s later than that, about a quarter
after.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ah, you see one, you’ve seen them all.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So that’s the last one you’ve got to show
us, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah. You want to run them backwards?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I wonder where they get the girls to make
these movies?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Might as well go home, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Life is short.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: the projector, You guys feel like going down
to have a drink for Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah! What do you say? One last drink for
Arnold!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: from his slouched You can say what you want
to about these pictures – they’re really pretty bad – but they get
you.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Don’t you think we ought to clean up the
place?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, I got a woman comes in.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I almost fell asleep during the last one.
Well, what do you say, huh? Let’s go! One last drink!</p>
<p><strong>interior. living room charlie and helen’s apartment</strong>:
Helen and Julie. A corner lamp in the living room is lit, lending a soft
but not too effective light to the room. The two young women are on the
couch. Helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to Julie, who
has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them
forty-five minutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in
front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. She is
talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over
with.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: … He’s a boy, my Mike. Till the day he dies,
he’ll never be more than fifteen. Perpetual adolescence, that’s the
curse of the professional man. He spends his whole youth trying to be a
doctor, a lawyer, an accountant. Then he spends the rest of his life
looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, I know. Charlie and I hardly even see
each other.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s very hard on the wife, Helen. These are
the years when you should be building your marriage. Instead, you grow
away from each other. I’ve seen it happen with my friends. In the end,
they have nice homes in New Rochelle, and a maid, and their maids are
happier than they are. But sometimes it does work. It can be done,
Helen. Encourage Charlie to stay with his school because…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, I will, Julie …</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: … he’s an ambitious boy …</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: … oh, it’s not just he’s ambitious …</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: … and if he doesn’t fulfill himself, he’ll
resent you and your baby the rest of his life.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, I don’t want him to quit. He loves
accounting, Julie. I see him sometimes, sitting over his homework. He’s
got his ledgers out, and he’s adding up columns of figures as long as
his arm. And he’s chuckling. You’d think he was reading the comics. He
has a book there, Business Law. How he can read it I don’t know. But
I’ll be watching television or something, and he’ll come over, and he’ll
start telling me about some fine legal point. I don’t know what he’s
talking about, but it’s enough for me to see how excited it makes him.
He loves it, Julie. You can’t take something like that away from him.
It’s just – it’s just I feel we’re not really close any more. I mean, he
comes home from school, lots of times I’m asleep already. And, when I do
see him, he seems all involved with himself. He looks at me sometimes as
if I were a stranger to him, and I feel sometimes I am. I’m afraid of
that, Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then get rid of the baby.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: If I had it to do again, believe me, that’s
what I would do.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: of the depth of what You don’t mean that,
Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yes, I do. My children are the only things in
my life now, but I would rather have a husband.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I wouldn’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s what I said, too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let’s not even think about it. If I even
mentioned it, he’d – he’d hit me, I think.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I want this baby, Julie. I’ve wanted this
baby for a long time. It’s the only thing I’ve ever asked of Charlie. If
I mentioned that to him – I don’t know what he’d do.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello…. Hello, Charlie, where are you calling
from? … You sound like you’re having a nice time…. Oh, you’re having a
ball, huh? … Well, what time do you think you’ll be coming home?</p>
<p><strong>interior. phone booth in eighth street bar</strong>: Charlie
in the phone booth, smiling broadly. He seems in wonderful spirits.
Through the glass of the phone booth we can see part of the bar and some
of the barflies.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, that’s what I wanted to call you
about, honey. I think a couple of the guys are cutting out now. I think
Kennie’s going home. But I was wondering if you wanted me home for any
special reason.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just a minute, Charlie….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Excuse me a minute, Julie. It’s Charlie….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Charlie? … Charlie, come on home now…. No, I
feel all right. I just miss you. Julie’s here, and we were talking about
you, and I just miss you…. Ah, come on…. Well, no, if you’re having such
a good time, stay out and enjoy yourself…. No, Charlie, I don’t want you
to come home if you’re having a good time…. I’m not lonely. Julie’s
here. We’re talking. I was washing some things…. I know, that’s what I
told you this morning. You’ve finally got a night off for yourself. I
don’t want you to feel guilty about it…. Charlie, do you love me? … You
sound angry…. No, come home any time you want…. Charlie … sink down onto
the Charlie, there’s no girls at this party, are there? … I’m not
checking up on you, Charlie. I just miss you, that’s all…. All right,
Charlie, please, I don’t want to argue with you. Julie’s in the living
room. … All right, have a good time, stay out as long as you want…. All
right, Charlie, good- bye.</p>
<p><strong>interior. phone booth in eighth street bar</strong>: Charlie
in booth. The broad grin has disappeared from his face. As seen through
the closed glass doors of the booth, he is a very sullen and despondent
young man. He stands now, pushes the doors open, and comes out. CAMERA
PULLS BACK so that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone
booths. Next to the phone booth are two doors marked GUYS and DOLLS.
Kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of the bar where the other
members of the bachelor party are grouped in a booth. He is headed for
the door marked GUYS. Charlie regards Kenneth bleakly as he
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The party breaking up?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I don’t know. I’m going home. You going
home?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the men’s room</strong>: A small, white-tiled, yet
somehow not too clean, men’s room, two-urinal size. There is one
washbowl with a small mirror over it, and two water closets with doors,
separated from each other by a steel partition. Charlie perches on the
edge of the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk. Kenneth moves
off camera for more practical use of the room. CAMERA stays on Charlie
who seems depressed, pensive, sad. Stay on him for a long moment. Then
…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You love your wife, Kennie?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth’s voice</strong>: Well, I’ve been married six years.
I’ve got two kids that keep me awake all night long. Every Sunday, we go
out driving in Long Island looking for a house that’s going to take one,
probably two mortgages. I better love my wife.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t feel like going home. Are you
going? Hang around, Kennie. It’s only about nine thirty, ten.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: It’s after ten. It’s about ten after
ten.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: The party’s getting a little wild in there
anyway. Eddie and Walter got poor Arnold nailed in there, they’re trying
to talk him into getting a girl. This party’s going to wind up in a
joint, let me tell you. This is a good time to blow.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah…. I should have gone to class tonight.
I’m paying twenty bucks a credit. The least I can do is go to class.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I take one night off, I can’t even enjoy
myself. Did you know Eddie went back to Europe?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: No, I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He was telling me he lived in Paris for
three months. I’d like to do that!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m going to quit. What am I killing myself
for?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Quit what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Quit night school. Tonight was the first
laughs I’ve had in years. I can’t remember the last time I had so much
fun. Look what I’m missing. I’m making a pretty good living. I can
support a wife and baby on what I make. I’m going to quit! I mean it.
I’m going to quit. Boy, what a time to have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You don’t have to quit school because
you’re having a baby, Charlie. There are lots of guys go to night school
with two, three kids.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You ought to meet some of these guys.
They’re just grinding their lives away. It’s an obsession with some of
these guys. I mean, what’s the point? So I’ll go five more years to
night school. So I’ll get my degree. So I’ll get a job as a junior
accountant for three years at seventy-five bucks a week. I’m making
better than that now. And then it just starts. The CPA exams. By the
time I’m fifty, I can start living. At this point, I get a heart attack
and an ulcer, and they bury me in the ground, and they say: “That was
Charlie Samson, the man who didn’t see a movie in fifty years.” Why go
through all that? I’ll quit. I feel so mad right now, you better keep an
eye on me, Kennie, because I’m going to wind up punching somebody.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Come on, let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do I want to go home for?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You’re in a lousy mood.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Charlie, go home. I can see you’re going to
get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and you’re going to
wake up in the morning feeling like two-bits.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’d be a profit.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Charlie, about five years ago, I went
without a job for seven months. Alice was carrying our first baby. We
were living on money I borrowed from my brother. I don’t know if you
remember me in those days, but it was rough. I used to go out every
night, put a load on, and make a pass at any girl who looked at me. And
I mean any. Big, tall, short, fat, anything. Well, one night I picked up
some tomato somewheres, and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres, and
I kept calling her Alice all night. So she says to me: “My name ain’t
Alice. Who’s Alice?” So I said: “Alice is my wife,” and I got up and I
went home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I don’t know. I had a point when I started
telling that story.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not looking for another woman.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yes, you are, Charlie. You may not know it,
but you are. So go on home, Charlie, before you get any drunker than you
are. Charlie, you start messing with other women, something goes. It’ll
kill your marriage. It’ll kill your wife. It’ll just kill her. What my
wife went through – well, I don’t even want to remember it. It’s never
the same with your wife again, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not looking for any woman.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I think what I was trying to say was you
stick with your night school. Some guys have to make peace with
themselves that they’re never going to amount to too much. A guy like
me. Once I made that peace with myself, I found out it doesn’t really
matter what you amount to. I got a nice wife and two children I complain
about all the time, but if anything ever happened to either one of them,
I think I’d die. But you don’t have to make that kind of peace, and
you’d be crazy to settle for less than what you want. You want
something, Charlie. I think that’s wonderful. You’re a little drunk now,
and you’re fed up to the teeth. Everybody gets fed up, Charlie. You
stick with it. You’re going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re a nice guy, Kennie.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Sure. You’re a nice guy too.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Watch it – will you, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait a minute…. What are you, a wise
guy?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Come on, Charlie, let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m just about drunk enough right now to
bust somebody right in the nose.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … Come on, will you? Look Walter, it’s just
the shank of the evening! What’s so special in your home? You got a
floor show every night? Who are you married to, Jayne Mansfield? Come
on, it’s not even half past ten!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: We got to get up tomorrow, go to work,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’re just starting! We got to get Arnold a
girl yet!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Eddie, please …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s the whole point to a bachelor party!
You got to get the guy a girl!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Look, fellows, it’s been a nice clean party
…</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Well, Arnold, since I’m not going to see
you again before the wedding, congratulations and best wishes in the
coming future to both you and the bride.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Thanks a lot, Kennie….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re not going, are you, Charlie? We’re
just starting! We got to get Arnold a girl yet!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I want to thank you for the presents,
Kennie….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …No, I’ll stick around another hour or
so….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … That’s my boy….</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … Honestly, I never expected any
presents….</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: … Aren’t you coming home? …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … What for? Sit around talking to my sister
Julie? …</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … I want to thank all you fellows …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, stop thanking them, Arnold. They
just gave you a party, they didn’t elect you President.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: … This has been one of the nicest nights of
my life….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let’s go someplace … let’s go to a
nightclub.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s great with me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Ken.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: … Well, listen, fellows, I’m cutting out….
Good night, Walter, Eddie. … You coming, Charlie? …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … No, I’ll kill another hour…. Come on,
Kennie….</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: No, you go ahead. I’ll see you in the
morning, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay, I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. third street</strong>: The little stretch of
strip-joints on Third Street. Bright little cluster of honky-tonks.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. third street</strong>: Our bachelor party, now down
to four carousers, ambles along the rather filled sidewalk, looking at
the cardboard cutouts of the strippers in the windows of the night
clubs.</p>
<p><strong>interior. third street night club</strong>: We look down on
the whole night club, showing the dark, dingy, crowded, smallness of it.
There is a strip going on. It doesn’t look very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: So what do you think of my girl, Eddie? You
met her. Be honest with me. Tell me the truth. I had the feeling you
didn’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come on, come on, Arnold. What do you want
from me.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Listen, Charlie, I’d like to ask you a
little advice. I mean, you’re a married man. This girl, I’m supposed to
marry, she’s all right, but I’m not really attracted to her, you know
what I mean? That’s important, isn’t it? I kissed her a couple of times,
but I … I don’t know why I’m getting married, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What did you say, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I said, I don’t know why I’m getting
married. I did pretty good for thirty-two years without getting married.
I get along fine at home. My mother’s a good cook. I have a nice life.
What do I want to break it all up for?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, Arnold, everybody feels that way
before they get married.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Yeah? Did I ever show you a picture of my
girl?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, you didn’t, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Do you want to see a picture?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I want you to give me your honest
impression, Charlie. She isn’t much, is she?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can’t see much in this light, but she
looks like a nice pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t say that. We were matched
up, you know. The families kind of agreed on it. I was brought over to
her by my mother and father. That’s how I met her. She’s some kind of
tenth cousin. She’s all right. She’s quiet. I kissed her a couple of
times. She just sat there and I kissed her. I think she expected more.
She even asked me that. She said to me: “Are you afraid of me?” I really
don’t go out with women much. You know. Don’t tell nobody this, Charlie,
but you aren’t going to believe this, but I never … I mean, you wouldn’t
believe that a guy of my age, I never … Don’t tell anybody I ever told
you this, but I never– I mean, Charlie, she’s a widow. She’s been
married already – she’s going to expect a lot – and I never —- What do
you think I ought to do?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you mean, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I mean, you think I ought to marry her?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, Arnold, even if I knew the girl, I
wouldn’t answer that question. I may not like her, but she may be fine
for you.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Because I’m thinking of calling the whole
thing off.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s kind of late for that, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’m scared stiff, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What are you scared about?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’m not much of a talker, and she’s one of
those quiet ones. What are you supposed to do with your wife? I mean,
most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Most of the time, Arnold, you don’t even
see her. You’re away working. You come home, she fixes you supper. Then
one of you washes the dishes. Then if you’re not tired, you can go to
the movies or visit somebody. Or you watch teevee.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I do that now with my mother.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know what there is to marriage. I
suppose it’s to have kids.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: So what do you think I ought to do? You
think I ought to go through with this marriage?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold, I can’t answer that!</p>
<p><strong>exterior. street – night</strong>: Our four amble along
Washington Square North, headed west. In the background, the high
apartment houses. It is about midnight now, and there are a number of
people around, and there are lots of lights in the windows. There is
still the feeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of our
bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on Lexington Avenue.
Now, of course, there are only four of them, and there is somewhat a
feeling of straggling about them.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. street – night</strong>: The four men straggle
along Tenth Street east of Seventh Avenue. This is a dark little street.
Off at the intersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional
car moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems an empty,
sleeping street of dark and old little apartment houses. The houses
sometimes have little stoops. On one of the stoops, there is a woman
sitting. She is in her thirties, not attractive nor unattractive. She
wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying
with the idea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men approach
her, she looks up, half quizzically, half questioningly. The four men
note her in passing and seem to continue on, but then come to a dragging
halt about ten paces down.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I think we’ve got one for you, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: One what?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Ah, come on, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: She ain’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’ve got a live one.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arnold, for Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, leave him alone! He doesn’t want
to.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Come on. We’ve been walking around all night
here – are you a man, or ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: All right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I don’t know who you fellows think I am,
but you fellows have the wrong idea about me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar down the
corner. That’s where we’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I’m afraid you fellows have the wrong
idea about me.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: She says we have the wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: You fellows are working under a
misconception.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’ll be in the bar, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You all right, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Yeah, I’m all right, it’s just …</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Look, I’m just sitting here, fellows. Did
I say anything? I was just sitting here.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: You want to come with me, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You want me to? All right. I’ll go up with
you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where you going, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll go up with him. Moral support.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the—- we’ll all go with you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’ll be down at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the house</strong>: A dark, ill-lit hallway. A
flight of stairs going up, wooden railings, worn carpeting. The Woman
starts up the stairs, the two men following her.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Ssshhh….</p>
<p><strong>interior. landing</strong>: The Woman has come around to one
of the three doors on the landing and is inserting a key into a lock.
Arnold and Charlie appear now at the head of the stairway. The Woman
goes into her room, leaving the door open. A moment later, a shaft of
light streams out into the landing. For a moment, nothing happens. Then
Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down the landing to the open doorway and
shaft of light.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Arnold, you don’t have to go through
with this.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I think I should.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll wait out here for you, okay?</p>
<p><strong>interior. the woman’s room</strong>: It is a furnished room
for which the woman pays eleven dollars a week. It is not particularly
unkempt or tarty. There is a print slipcover on the soft chair and
flowers on an end table. There is a studio couch with a neat spread and
throw pillows on it. The Woman stands expressionlessly in front of the
old chest of drawers. She has kicked off one shoe and she is now kicking
off the other. She starts to say something:</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Listen, I don’t want you to think I don’t
have a job. I got a job. I work.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Are you afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>interior. landing</strong>: Charlie looks up at the opening
of the door and Arnold’s entrance. The Woman stands in the doorway.
Arnold moves quickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white-
faced and trembling.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: What’s the matter? Hey. Hey, you. Hey,
you, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let’s go. What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I don’t know. Ask him. What’s the matter?
Hey, you. You, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go back inside…. All right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: How about that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What happened, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just scared.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, I don’t blame you, I’d be scared too
like this. I don’t know why we dragged you up here in the first place.
It’s a barbaric custom. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Don’t tell Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No I won’t, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Why don’t we just sit here for ten minutes
or so?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Don’t ever tell anybody.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Please, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I won’t tell anybody.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Anything wrong down there?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No. No. Nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>interior. corner bar</strong>: Neighborhood bar with about
ten people in it. Eddie and Walter are two of them. Eddie is playing on
one of those bowling machines. He seems surly, ill-tempered,
restless.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey Walter – you know what we ought to do,
don’t you? We ought to go to that party. Remember that girl Charlie
picked up on Tenth Street?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m going to die, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not tonight, Walter. Tonight you’re going to
live. Ah, these things are fixed. I’m down to my last buck. Got any
money on you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey! How’d it go, lover? mysterious smile,
pregnant with Hey, Charlie, let’s go to this party. It’s only twelve
o’clock. Oh, these parties are mad, man. All the women wear pajamas, and
all the men wear beards. Everybody sits on the floor. Arnold, you got
any money? I spent my last buck on those drinks. How about you,
Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I got a little over a buck.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are we, all out? So let’s go to this
party then. Hey, Charlie, come on.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You can have that girl you picked up on Tenth
Street. Come on…. All right, you married men want to be so married
that’s all right with me. But I’d like to see some women tonight. arm
with more hostility Come on.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Lay off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’d like to see some women tonight, you know.
Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Cut it out, Eddie. You keep punching me, I
swear I’m going to belt you one.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: All right, all right, fellows.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look, don’t get so tough with me,
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: All right, all right, come on.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t want to see any other women!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right! Go on home! Who’s holding you?!
You want to call it a night? Because I’m tired of grousing from one bar
to another. You guys go home, and I’ll go about my merry way. All right?
And don’t get so tough with me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, don’t poke me.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Come on, let’s go … gee …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You mess around with other women, it kills
your wife and it kills your marriage.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, you guys go home, and I’ll go on
my merry way. pauses, then turns, his sudden hot temper gone as quickly
as Hey, you guys, you guys want to go to a nutty night club, look at the
nuts? There’s a nutty night club over on Second Avenue. You know what we
can do? Charlie, you live in Stuyvesant Town, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know what we can do? We’ll take the
crosstown. We’ll go over to Charlie’s house, he’ll get some money, and
we’ll go to this nutty night club. It’s right down on Second Avenue. You
got any money home, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you say, Arnold? You want to
go?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Charlie, get Walter.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Walter….</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m going to die, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Excuse me … excuse me … attention to
Charlie, who, alone of the three, seems painfully interested in what
Walter is talking So what’ll I do? I mean, he says, I’m going to die. I
mean, the man’s a specialist. He says: “Go to Arizona, go to Colorado,”
he says. “You got to get out of New York or you’re going to die.” He
tells my wife, the stupid idiot. My wife cried all night. I’m going to
die, you know that? You understand that? I’m going to die? You know what
an asthma attack is like? Your heart starts beating like a drum! I
passed out the last time!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter, why don’t you just quit the job and
pack your bags and get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I can’t quit. Don’t you understand? You
don’t understand. I can’t quit! I got a fourteen-year-old girl, I don’t
know what time she comes in at night any more. She’s so wild, these
kids. I got a nineteen-year-old boy in college; he’s going to be a
doctor if I have to die. He’s not going to quit school. You hear me! I
worked hard to put that kid in school! I don’t care if I die! I don’t
care! What am I going to do in Arizona? Who wants me? Who’s going to
give me a job? What kind of a job am I going to get? I’m forty-eight
years old. They don’t want no forty-eight-year-old bookkeeper. They got
machines from IBM. You ever been up on the ninth floor? You ever see all
those IBM machines? What am I going to do out in Arizona? You look in
the Help Wanted lately? You see any jobs listed for Bookkeeper, Male?
What are you talking about? Do you know what you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Easy, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Take your hand off me. You don’t know
nothing! You’re just a kid! You don’t know! I’ve seen death, kid. I’ve
seen it, boy. I know what it looks like. few paces down the aisle,
stumbles over Excuse me…. Forty-eight years old and so what? What does
it mean? What happened? What have I got? What did I make? Who needs me?
So this is it. A man’s life, nothing. Worry about being sick, worry
about making money, worry about your wife, worry about your kids, and
you’re on your way to the grave from the day you’re born. The days drag
on, and the years fly by, and so what? What is it all about? Will you
tell me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Life is nothing! It’s a gag! It’s a joke!
It’s a mortgage! It’s a bankrupt! It’s a lot of noise over nothing!
Sound and fury! Isn’t that what the man said? What do you think, I never
read a book? I read a book! Don’t worry! I was a bright kid! Everybody
thought I was going to be the first Catholic to be President! Where did
it all go?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where did it all go?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where are we, Third Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Where are we getting off? Next stop?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What did you say, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter, where are you going? Come here
…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What, did Walter get out?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter, stay there, we’ll come back on the
next train. Stay there.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Poor Walter, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter! …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’ll be all right, Charlie. God protects
drunks and fools.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Walter! Grab a cab if you’re going
home!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Poor Walter, I didn’t know he was so sick. I
thought there was something wrong with him, though. He’s been out so
much.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I didn’t know he was so sick.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s me in fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. fourteenth street and first avenue</strong>: We
look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of three comes up
the stairs to the sidewalk. It is midnight, and the street is
occasionally patrolled by a taxicab. The sidewalks are pretty empty,
just a few people walking. Perhaps a drugstore is still open, and its
lonely lit store front catches the eye.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s where I live.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In the back there. You can’t see it from
here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It looks like a state hospital.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It looks like a prison.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, it does look a little like a
prison.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Charlie …</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Charlie! What about the money? Have you
got ten bucks?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right, if you want to walk me to the
house, I’ll get you ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>interior. landing outside charlie’s apartment</strong>: We
are looking at the twin elevator doors. The light of an elevator climbs
into the little square window of one of the elevator doors. The door
opens, and Charlie, Eddie, and Arnold shuffle out into the landing. They
are all a little soggy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll be right out.</p>
<p><strong>interior. charlie and helen’s apartment</strong>: Charlie
comes in. The dining area is lit, and there is the lamp lit in the
living room. As Charlie moves to the living room, we can see that Helen
is seated on the couch, watching television. The gray-white light of the
television set drifts out into the room. Helen is in her pajamas and she
has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up. She is half-watching
television; the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her
fingernails and other aspects of manicure. She looks up as Charlie comes
into the living room, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiya, have a nice time?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m taking ten bucks. A couple of the guys
are waiting outside. I promised them I’d loan them ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tomorrow’s payday. I’ll get it back
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s in the drawer.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the bedroom</strong>: Charlie is seated on the bed,
hunched, in deep depression. He is holding the ten-dollar bill. His eyes
are open, but there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face. Helen
moves quietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s the matter, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s not so bad, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know what’s the matter with me, I
keep getting so depressed. I’m going to quit night school, Helen. My
nerves are shot.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Those guys are waiting outside. I better
give them their money.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Charlie … Maybe I shouldn’t have the
baby?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you mean? …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Isn’t that dangerous? … Well, I don’t know
… maybe … Well, you brought it up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You really don’t want this baby….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re my husband, Charlie. This is your baby
too. That doesn’t mean anything to you. For the first time in our
marriage I feel I can’t depend on you, Charlie – I’m not important to
you. because she can no longer trust her voice. After a I could make my
life sound hard, too, Charlie. I work all day, I rush home, I make you
dinner. I sit home alone four nights a week, I’m even alone when you’re
here because when do I see you? But it was easy for me because I loved
you. Do you think I care whether you’re an accountant or a ditch digger,
or even out of work? All I ever wanted was you. And this baby because
it’s you, too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Leave me alone, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I decided I’d quit school and …</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t care …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I decided I’d quit school and come home in
the evenings like everybody else and live a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t care what you do, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t care what I do either.</p>
<p><strong>interior. landing</strong>: Eddie and Arnold, looking up as
the door opens and Charlie comes out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What took you so long? What did you do, blow
open the safe?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll give it to you tomorrow. I’ll see you in
the morning, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s go to that party – we’ll have a
ball!</p>
<p><strong>interior. greenwich village duplex apartment</strong>: This
is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street which consists of
one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little
rolling stepladder to reach the books on the upper shelves of the
built-in bookcases. There is a little wrought-iron stairway that leads
to the second floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: I’m sure that’s the police again.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Are you coming to complain about the
noise?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do we look like complainers?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: I don’t know who you are, but come in, come
in. I don’t know half the people who are here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: The police have been here twice. The first
fellow was just adorable. We gave him a drink, and he’s upstairs in a
bedroom now, for all I know.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: If you want something to drink, you’ll just
have to go into the kitchen and get it yourself. The place is just mad.
Do you write, paint or sing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Boy, do you get invited to a party like
this or do you get committed?</p>
<p><strong>young chap</strong>: I heard that. It’s awfully funny.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Beat it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is going to be like shooting ducks. Pick
out your duck, men.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let’s get out of here, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The last time I saw you, you was with that
girl you picked up. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s over there talking to that old guy
with the glasses.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I didn’t like her. She’s one of these real
Greenwich Village phonies. If I added up all the guys she told me about,
she must have had her first boy friend when she was two years old. Where
are you going, Eddie. Stick around a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m with that one over there – not bad, huh?
I think she’s a Communist. I think she’s trying to talk me into joining
the Party.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How are you making out?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not so hot. I may have to join.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hang around. Let’s talk a bit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I better get back. She’s liable to recruit
somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where’s Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s in the kitchen. I think he’s out cold.
I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey Arnold– You okay, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: That old man I was talking to
before? That’s my landlord. About ten thirty last night, someone began
pounding on my door. So I got up and opened the door, and there was this
white-haired man with a pince-nez standing there. I said: “What do you
want?” So he said: “I’m the landlord, and I want the rent.” Well, I just
looked at him because the landlord I knew was a Hungarian man named
Frank, who was crazy about me, and the issue of rent never came up, you
see. Well, it turned out that this man with the pince-nez had just
bought the building the day before and he kept grabbing my arm and
saying he wanted the rent. Well, then I got the point, of course. Well,
meanwhile, a boy named Bob I knew had come over. He’s engaged to a
Javanese girl with wonderful planes in her face who lives at the
International House. But he’s crazy about me and he drops in about twice
a week. Well, meanwhile, my new landlord was grabbing my arm and kept
quoting poetry to me which he was trying to pass off as his own. He was
an absolute fraud. He scotched the whole thing from Baudelaire. “Tu
mettrais.” You know that one. Well, he kept screaming about the rent – I
didn’t like him, you know – and I called this boy named George who used
to live in Poughkeepsie when I was going to Vassar, and he’s crazy about
me. He lives in St. Luke’s place now, but he goes to Poughkeepsie every
Wednesday to see his mother, he’s got an Oedipus, so that was out. Well,
my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me. I said:
“How existentialist can you get? You just met me five minutes ago.” He
was absolutely crazy about me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You have an apartment around here
somewheres? What’s up there? What kind of rooms are up there?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: So, I finally got to sleep
around six thirty….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: No! Oh, stop trying to be so
primitive.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: I find you very unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: There’s nothing upstairs. Oh, I
don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the bedroom</strong>: It is a tiny bedroom. The bed
is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things. An
uncovered, improvised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and
things, gives the room an overburdened look. Charlie comes into the room
after her, closes the door, looks for the latch. She pushes some of the
things on the bed aside and sits down and waits while Charlie latches
the door, a matter of turning a bent nail into locking position. She
begins to prattle again.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: So I finally got to sleep around
six thirty this morning. At nine thirty, someone began pounding on my
door again. I got out of bed and opened the door, and there was my
landlord with the pince-nez wearing a blue silk kimono. “Oh, for
heaven’s sakes,” I said, “what do you want now?” He said: “I’m the
landlord, and I want the rent.” I said: “You’re an old man, go to
sleep.” Then the phone rang. It was a boy named Andrew I know who
teaches physics at Columbia University, and he’s insanely jealous. He’s
married and has four children, but he keeps badgering me to run away
with him to Nicaragua, throw up his professorship and all that. Well, my
landlord began shouting some garbled Baudelaire at the top of his lungs,
and a little Verlaine, and a little Huysmans. He apparently has some
kind of fetish about French decadents. And naturally, Andrew heard him,
and he got furious, and he said: “Who’s that I hear?” I said, “That’s
the landlord.” He said: “What does he want?” I said: “He wants the
rent.” Well, at this point, I felt like chucking the whole business and
going back to Bessemer City and going to work in my father’s hardware
store.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Just say you love me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Just say you love me. You don’t
have to mean it.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: No, don’t. …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Say you love me….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Say you love me….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on….</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I love you! I love you!</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Look, maybe we ought to go
someplace else? I’m having a very tricky thing going with my landlord
and I don’t want him to see us leaving together. So you know what you
do? There’s a bar down the street. You go out the door and turn to your
right. You know the one I mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Well, you go there and I’ll be
there as fast as I can. Now, wait for me now, because I can’t stand
being alone at night. You’ll like me. I’m supposed to be very amusing.
All right?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey, Eddie …</p>
<p><strong>interior. living room – greenwich village apartment</strong>:
Charlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper. He makes his
way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back of the room, throwing an
intense pitch at his girl, talking quickly, smiling, gesturing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Eddie, I’m cutting out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wait a minute, I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t want to take you away from your
girl, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aah, this one lives out in Long Island with
her mother. What kind of Communist is that? It’ll take me a half hour on
the subway there and a half hour back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where’s Arnold? Still in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I guess so. I’ll see you, next time I get to
Long Island.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Arnold, come on.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, it wasn’t a bad party. We killed a
couple of hours anyway.</p>
<p><strong>exterior. greenwich village apartment – night</strong>: The
three carousers come out into the street. The door closes behind them.
The night air is hot and muggy. They walk down the street toward the
corner where only the light of the corner bar gives any indication of
life. There is a newspaper on the sidewalk which Eddie bends down to
pick up, and the three men straggle to a halt. Eddie opens the paper to
the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the street lamp.
Arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans against it. Charlie stands in
the middle of the sidewalk, a melancholy, pondering young man. The
evening seems to have come to a dead halt. After a moment, Eddie starts
walking again, reading the paper as he does. The others slowly gather
themselves and follow him.</p>
<p><strong>interior. the corner bar</strong>: A wall clock reading
twenty-five minutes to three. CAMERA PANS DOWN the wall. We are in the
bar on the corner of Tenth and Sixth, almost entirely empty except for
Charlie, Eddie, Arnold, and the bartender. The three carousers are
leaning wearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person in
the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a woman in her
forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar stool at the far end of
the bar, gloomily reading a newspaper. CAMERA MOVES DOWN and IN on
Charlie, Eddie, and Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … I mean, you can’t compare the two. This kid
the Yankees have in centerfield. Are you trying to tell me he’s a
natural .368 hitter? What’s he normally hit, .310, .315? Musial led the
National League in hitting six times. He’s only having a fair year, this
year – and he’s still hitting .320. Musial is an all-time great!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Eddie – Eddie. So what do you think, Eddie?
You think I ought to go through with this marriage?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know about you, Arnold, but if it was
me, boy, I’d be in China by now. Who have the Yankees got on first?
Skowron. Boy, how they touted Skowron. All right, he’s having a lucky
year.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … Well, I mean, is there any argument? Hodges
is the best first baseman in both leagues….</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: So, Eddie, what do you think? You think I
ought to marry her, go to China, or what?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arnold, if it bothers you so much, call her
up and tell her to forget the whole deal. All right Hodges is having a
bad year – but how about last year? He hit over .300. He only hit
thirty- five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs—-</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: So, Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Arnold! Get rid of her! You’re driving me
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All right, who’s on second? We got Charlie
Neal or Gilliam, for that matter, and this isn’t even counting Jackie
Robinson, head and shoulders, even with a trick knee, the best second
baseman in both leagues if they’d let him play there. We got three guys,
for Pete’s sake, who can outplay anybody the Yankees put on second.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ever see Charlie Neal go to his right? That
Yankee guy, what’s his name – he can’t go to his right. And don’t forget
Neal gets a lot of bases on balls, and once he’s on the bases, man, it
unnerves the pitcher …</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What’s Brooklyn going to do for
pitching?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Never heard of Newcombe? Never heard of
Erskine?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What have you got to compare with Ford,
Kucks, McDermott, Turley—</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: McDermott – McDermott hasn’t pitched a full
game since last year.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The best relief pitcher in both
leagues.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the matter with Eddie Roebuck?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: How do you compare Eddie Roebuck with
McDermott?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you, a Yankee fan?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, drop dead. A Yankee fan.</p>
<p><strong>arnold’s voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I did it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I just woke her up! I called her! I said:
“I’m not going to marry you. What do I want to marry you for? I’m having
a ball. What am I going to marry you for?”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Boy, he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think he’s just called his girl, broke
his engagement.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Is that what he was yelling about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wake up, kid. Help me get him up,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You think he did it because I was needling
him there before? I was just needling him.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You better get him out of here because
I’m closing up now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We better get him home.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ah, let’s not break it up yet. I thought you
were waiting for this girl.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s three o’clock in the morning, for
Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Take him out in the air. He’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What a bachelor party. We start out
celebrating the guy’s wedding; we wind up breaking his engagement. What
do we owe you here? Eddie, pay it, will you? I gave you the ten
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want to go home for?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s going to take us an hour to get him
home. He lives in Queens somewheres. By the time I get back to
Fourteenth Street, it’ll be daybreak. What are you going to do, stay up
all night? Don’t you want to go home sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What am I going to do home? I read all the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, go to sleep then.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ah, don’t go home, Charlie. I feel like doing
something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What? Stand around this bar and argue about
the Yankees and the Dodgers? Wind up with some miserable, lonely girl
who begs you to say, “I love you”? Go home, Eddie. Go to bed. You got to
go home sometimes. I’ll take Arnold home. Come on, Arnold, kid. I’m
going to take you home.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, honey, what are you, a Yankee fan or a
Dodger fan?</p>
<p><strong>bar hag</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you all right, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Would you like to go back in and sit
down?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What subway do you take, Arnold, the BMT?
Can you make it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Arnold, I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, he’s all right. Look, I’ve got to
take my friend home…</p>
<p><strong>the existentialist</strong>: Are you coming back? Where does
he live? How long will you be?</p>
<p><strong>interior. bmt subway – hurtling northward</strong>: Half past
three, and the car is absolutely empty except for Charlie and Arnold.
Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, one leg buckled beneath him,
the other on the floor. He is sleeping heavily. Charlie sits
expressionlessly, obviously involved in deep introspection. The car
buckets along into the night.</p>
<p><strong>interior. queens apartment house</strong>: Arnold and Charlie
coming up to a landing. It is the third floor; we can see enough of the
corridor to see two apartment doors, lettered “3D” and “3C.” A small
overhead bulb provides a thin sketchy light. Charlie and Arnold shuffle
down the landing to apartment 3D. They pause outside the door. The scene
is played in low mutters and whispers.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, thanks a lot, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Yeah, I’m all right. I’m a little groggy,
but I’m awake anyway. You don’t want to come in, do you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I think my father and mother are up. I hear
voices. My girl must have called them because they wouldn’t be up at
this hour.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, you just go in and explain to them
that you were drunk, and you’re sorry, and you’ll call your girl the
first thing in the morning because she must really be upset about
this.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: listening at I think she’s here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: My girl. I think I hear her voice in
there.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, be nice to her, Arnold. Remember, you
woke her up in the middle of the night and probably scared her to
death.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: What’ll I say to her, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know, Arnold. What do you feel like
saying to her? Do you really love this girl? Do you want to marry her?
Are you marrying this girl because your family wants you to marry her,
or why?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I think I like her, Charlie. It’s just that
I’m afraid I won’t make a good husband.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, tell her what you told me, Arnold.
Tell her you’re scared, and that you don’t think you’ll make a good
husband. If she’s a halfway decent girl, she’ll try to understand how
you feel, and, if she loves you, she’s going to make it her job to make
you happy. That’s what love is, Arnold, when you have somebody else in
the world you want to be happy. My wife, Arnold, I don’t know what I’d
do without her. Arnold, I’ve got a tough grind ahead of me. Work all
day, I’ll go to night school at night. But my wife knows that I need
this to be happy, and she does everything she knows to help me. And
we’ve got a baby coming. But if you love that baby and you love your
wife, then it’s easy. Everything seems so easy to me now – I don’t know
why I even thought of quitting. in his eyes, and he hurriedly puts his
hand to his face shading his reddening Arnold, I want my wife so much
right now. I want her to be happy. I want to just go home and hold her
and tell her how much she means to me. I mean, even Walter, he’s going
to die, but don’t you think he’ll be in tomorrow morning, same old
Walter, jokes and laughs? He’s got somebody to live for. He’s even got
somebody to die for. I mean, how rich can a man be? And poor Eddie – I
used to be so jealous of him. I used to think he was so free. Free from
what? From loving a woman, from really wanting a woman. Arnold, what I’m
trying to tell you is life is nothing if you don’t love somebody but
life is wonderful if you do love somebody. Arnold, I want my wife so
much right now …</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’m going to tell her about that woman
tonight and everything. I’ll tell her about that woman.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Arnold, I want to get home so much to my
wife right now I’m going to bust.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’ll see you, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good-bye, Arnold, have a nice honeymoon.
I’ll see you when you get back.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’ll see you, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Hello, Louise. I’m very sorry, honest.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Sure, Arnold, I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I love you, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love you so much, Charlie. I love you so
much….</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I love you….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love you, Charlie, I love you, Charlie. I
love you, Charlie …</p>
