<h1 id="big-fish">big-fish</h1>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There are some fish that cannot be caught.
It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish. They’re just
touched by something extra. Call it luck. Call it grace. One such fish
was The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: By the time I was born, he was already a
legend. He’d taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.
Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned
in that river 60 years before. Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur,
left over from the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I didn’t put any stock into such speculation
or superstition. All I knew was I’d been trying to catch that fish since
I was a boy no bigger than you. And on the day you were born, that was
the day I finally caught him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now, I’d tried everything on it: worms,
lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese. But on that day I had a
revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t
going to work. I would have to use something he truly desired.</p>
<p><strong>little brave</strong>: Your finger?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Gold.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I tied my ring to the strongest line they
made – strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few
minutes – and I cast upriver.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before
the ring even hit the water. And just as fast, he snapped clean through
that line.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You can see my predicament. My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child,
was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Make him stop.</p>
<p><strong>will’s date</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I followed that fish up-river and down-river
for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: With these two hands, I reached in and
snatched that fish out of the river. I looked him straight in the eye.
And I made a remarkable discovery.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This fish, the Beast. The whole time we were
calling it a him, when in fact it was a her. It was fat with eggs, and
was going to lay them any day.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now, I was in a situation. I could gut that
fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest
catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be- born
son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own? This lady fish and
I, well, we had the same destiny.</p>
<p><strong>edward and will</strong>: We were part of the same
equation.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Honey, it’s still your night.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish
wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when
nothing else would attract it? That was the lesson I learned that day,
the day my son was born.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sometimes, the only way to catch an
uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What, a father’s not allowed to talk about
his son?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am a footnote in that story. I am the
context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally!
You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a
bind?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Come on, Will. Everyone likes that
story.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No Dad, they don’t. I do not like the story.
Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can. For one night, one night in your
entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It
revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sorry to embarrass you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re embarrassing yourself, Dad. You just
don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: After that night, I didn’t speak to my father
again for three years.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: William Bloom with the Associated Press if I
could just…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We communicated indirectly I guess. In her
letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: When I’d call, Mom would say that Dad was out
driving. Or swimming in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: True to form, we never talked about our not
talking.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself
in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me. We
were like strangers who knew each other very well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s
impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.
The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It doesn’t always make sense, and most of it
never happened.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But that’s what kind of story this is.</p>
<p><strong>young dr. bennett</strong>: Now, Mrs. Bloom, I’ll need you to
give me one good push. On three. One…</p>
<p><strong>young dr. bennett</strong>: Grab that baby!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father’s birth would set the pace for his
unlikely life. No longer than most men’s, but larger. And as strange as
his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Allo oui?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Yes, he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: It’s your mother.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, sure, let
me talk to him. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s more than they thought. They’re going to
stop chemo.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You need to go.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Probably tonight.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So which one’s it gonna be? The Monkey in
the Barn, the Dog in the Road?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The one about the witch.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Your mom says I can’t tell you that one
anymore. You get nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m not scared.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Neither was I. At first.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This all happened in the swamp outside of
Ashton. Kids weren’t supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the
snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you
could even scream. But there were five of us out there that night: Me,
Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not a one of us knew what was in store.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Zacky, turn your flashlight on!</p>
<p><strong>zacky</strong>: I don’t got any batteries!</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Then why’d you bring it?</p>
<p><strong>zacky</strong>: I don’t want to be in the swamp with a witch
and no flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Is it true she got a glass eye?</p>
<p><strong>wilbur freely</strong>: I heard she got it from Gypsies.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s a Gypsy?</p>
<p><strong>zacky</strong>: Your momma’s a Gypsy.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Your momma’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: You shouldn’t swear. There’s ladies
present.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>zacky</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>wilbur freely</strong>: Screw.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Turn off your flashlights! She’ll see
’em.</p>
<p><strong>adult edward</strong>: Now, it’s common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving
children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard. Witches use
those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.</p>
<p><strong>adult edward</strong>: Yet of the all the witches in Alabama,
there was one who was the most feared. For she had one glass eye, which
was said to contain mystical powers.</p>
<p><strong>wilbur freely</strong>: I hear if you look right at it, you
can see how you’re gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She’s not even
a real witch.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: You’re so sure, why don’t you go in and
get that eye? I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Or are you too scared?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll go in right now and get that eye.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Then do it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fine, I will.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Fine, you do it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fine, I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ruthie</strong>: Edward, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>wilbur freely</strong>: She’ll make soap out of you! That’s
what she does, she makes soap out of people.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ma’am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there’s
some folks’d like to see your eye.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: You get the eye?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I brought it.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>zacky</strong>: I saw how I was gonna die. I was old, and I
fell.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: I wasn’t old at all.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was thinking about death and all. About
seeing how you’re gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you
thought about, it could kind of screw you up. But it could kind of help
you, couldn’t it? Because you’d know that everything else you can
survive.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I guess I’m saying, I’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Huh. That’s how I go?</p>
<p><strong>adult edward</strong>: From that moment on, I no longer
feared death. And for that, I was as good as immortal.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We swam. The Atlantic, it’s not that big
really.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We rented a car.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You didn’t need to do that. You just
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You shouldn’t have flown. But…</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: It’s good to see you. You look
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Thank you. I’ll bet you need to –</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Down the hall on the right. The door sticks.
You have to really pull it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Is that Dr. Bennett’s car?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s up with your father.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s impossible. He won’t eat. And because
he won’t eat, he gets weaker. And because he’s weaker, he doesn’t want
to eat.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How much time does he have left?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You don’t talk about those things. Not
yet.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dr. Bennett. It’s good to see you. My wife,
Josephine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: You’re seven months.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: To the day.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: It’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You don’t think he looks any worse.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: No. I would say he’s the same.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Get him to drink one of these. He won’t, but
tell him he has to.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You – – are in for a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Having a kid changes everything. I mean,
there’s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you do any of that?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No, but I hear it’s terrible. Then you spend
years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with
nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You think I’m up for it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You learned from the best.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just drink half the can. I’ll tell her you
drank the whole thing. Everyone wins.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: People needn’t worry so much. It’s not my
time yet. This isn’t how I go.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Truly. I saw it in The Eye.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The Old Lady by the swamp.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She was a witch.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe
schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I saw my death in that eye. And this is not
how it happens.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So how does it happen?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Surprise ending. Wouldn’t want to ruin it
for you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There was this panhandler who used to stop
me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the
office.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And every day I gave him a quarter. Every
day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went
back there, you know what he said?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You owe me three-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: True story.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: When did you ever work in an office?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There’s a lot you don’t know about me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Your mother was worried we wouldn’t talk
again. And look at us. We’re talking fine. We’re storytellers, both of
us. I speak mine out, you write yours down. Same thing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad, I’m hoping we can talk about some things
while I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You mean, while I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’d just like to know the true versions of
things. Events. Stories. You.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Your mother hasn’t been keeping up the pool.
If you wanted to you could…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You know where the chemicals are?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I used to do it when you were gone, remember?
I used to do it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was never much for being at home, Will.
It’s too confining. And this, here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is the
worst thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I thought you weren’t dying.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I said this isn’t how I go. The last part is
much more unusual. Trust me on that.</p>
<p><strong>young will</strong>: Dr. Bennett says I’m going to have to be
home for a week.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s nothing. I once had to stay in bed
for three years.</p>
<p><strong>young will</strong>: Did you have chicken pox?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Truth is, no one quite knew what was wrong.
Most times, a person grows up gradually. I found myself in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My muscles couldn’t keep up with my bones,
and my bones couldn’t keep up with my body’s ambition. So I spent the
better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book
Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration. I had made it all the
way to the “G’s,” hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism,
when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The encyclopedia article, complete with
drawings.</p>
<p><strong>young edward</strong>: “Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish
will remain small. With more space, the fish can grow double, triple, or
quadruple its size.”</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It occurred to me then, that perhaps the
reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things. After
all, a giant man can’t have an ordinary-sized life.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: As soon as my bones had settled in their
adult configuration, I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for
myself in Ashton.</p>
<p><strong>single shots</strong>: Football hero Edward leads his team to
victory. On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret
love:</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Edward Bloom!</p>
<p><strong>single shot</strong>: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We
LOOK UP to see who’s pushing it, but it’s not Edward. It’s one of his
teenage EMPLOYEES.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever
seen. Until one day, a stranger arrived.</p>
<p><strong>sharecropper</strong>: He ate an entire cornfield!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: He ate my dog!</p>
<p><strong>hot-blooded shotgun toter</strong>: If you ain’t gonna stop
him Mayor, we will!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I won’t have mob violence in this town. Now,
has someone tried talking to him?</p>
<p><strong>some farmer</strong>: You can’t reason with ’im!</p>
<p><strong>shephard</strong>: He’s a monster!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll talk to him. See if I can get him to
move on.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Son, that creature could crush you without
trying.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Trust me, he’ll have to try.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My name is Edward Bloom! I want to talk to
you!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m not going anywhere until you show
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Armed with the foreknowledge of my own
death, I knew the giant couldn’t kill me. All the same, I preferred to
keep my bones unbroken.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So you can eat me. The town decided to send
a human sacrifice, and I volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My arms are a little stringy, but there’s
some good eating on my legs. I mean, I’d be tempted to eat them myself.
So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick. Because I’m not
much for pain, really.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Look, I can’t go back. I’m a human
sacrifice. If I go back, everyone will think I’m a coward. And I’d
rather be dinner than a coward.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Here, start with my hand. It’ll be an
appetizer.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I don’t want to eat you. I don’t want to eat
anybody. It’s just I get so hungry. I’m too big.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did you ever think maybe you’re not too big?
Maybe this town’s just too small. I mean, look at it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now
I’ve heard in real cities, they’ve got buildings so tall you can’t even
see the tops of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wouldn’t lie to you. And they’ve got
all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: I can.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So why are you wasting your time in a small
town? You’re a big man. You should be in the big city.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’re just trying to get me to leave, aren’t
you? That’s why they sent you here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What’s your name, Giant?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Karl.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mine’s Edward. And truthfully, I do want you
to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. You think this town is too
small for you, well, it’s too small for a man of my ambition. I can’t
see staying here a day longer.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You don’t like it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I love every square inch of it. But I can
feel the edges closing in on me. A man’s life can only grow to a certain
size in a place like this. So what do you say? Join me?</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now first, we gotta get you ready for the
city.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it’s with
a heavy heart we see you go. But take with you this Key to the City, and
know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to
you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone
seemed to have advice.</p>
<p><strong>various townfolk</strong>: Find yourself a nice girl! Don’t
trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But there was one person whose counsel I
held above all others.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: She said that the biggest fish in the river
gets that way by never being caught.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Beats me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There were two roads out of Ashton, a new
one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t. People didn’t use the
old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being
haunted.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Since I had no intention of ever returning
to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down
that old road.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You know anyone’s who’s taken it?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going
to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from
him again. Tell you what. You take the other way and I’ll cut through
here. Meet you on the far side.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: You’re not trying to run away?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Just to be sure, you can take my pack.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You stupid sonofa…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There comes a point where a reasonable man
will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake. The truth
is, I was never a reasonable man.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And what I recalled of Sunday School was
that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in
the end.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Friend!</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Welcome to ya. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Edward Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Bloom like a flower?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We
weren’t expecting you yet.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You were expecting me?</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: You must have taken a shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I did. It nearly killed me.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Life’ll do that to you. And
truthfully, the long way is easier, but it’s longer.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Much longer.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: And you’re here now, and that’s what
matters.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in
Alabama. Says here you’re from Ashton, right? Last person we had from
Ashton was Norther Winslow.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The poet? What ever happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: He’s still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I’ll tell you all about it. Hell, I’ll have him tell you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. I’ve gotta meet somebody. I’m already
running late.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Son, I already told you. You’re early.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Now tell me if that isn’t the best pie you
ever ate.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It truly is.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Everything here tastes better. Even
the water is sweet. Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid. At night
the wind goes through the trees and you’d swear there was a whole
symphony out there, playing just for you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wait! I need those!</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: There is no softer ground than
town.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: That rhymes!</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: He is our poet laureate.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sometimes in a dream, you’ll visit places
that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you’ve never met.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: A man might travel his entire life and never
find a place so inviting. My journey had scarcely begun, and I had
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: I’ve been working on this poem for
12 years.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: There’s a lot of expectation. I
don’t want to disappoint my fans.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s only three lines long.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: This is why you don’t show work in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Norther, do you ever regret not making it to
Paris?</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: I can’t imagine any place better
than here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re a poet. You oughta be able to. And
maybe if you’d seen more, you could.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No, it’s okay! I got it. I got the
snake.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wait! I’m sorry. Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>a girl’s voice</strong>: There’s leeches in there!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did you see that woman?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What did she look like?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well, she… uh…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Was she nekkid?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s not a woman, it’s a fish. No one ever
catches her.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Fish looks diff’rent to diff’rent people. My
daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from
the dead.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m eight. That means when I’m eighteen,
you’ll be 28. And when I’m 28, you’ll only be 38.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re pretty good at arithmetic.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And when I’m 38, you’ll be 48. And that’s not
much difference at all.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sure is a lot now, though, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Jenny thinks you’re quite a catch. We all
do.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: I said you’re quite a catch!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have to leave. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This town is everything a man could ask for.
And if I were to end up here, I’d consider myself lucky. But the fact
is, I’m not ready to end up anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: No one’s ever left.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How are you gonna make it without your
shoes?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I suspect it will hurt a lot.</p>
<p><strong>beamen</strong>: You won’t find a better place!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t expect to.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Promise me you’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I promise. Someday. When I’m really supposed
to.</p>
<p><strong>various shots</strong>: Edward negotiates the thorns in his
bare feet. It’s horrible. Almost unendurable.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I
was fated to get there eventually. After all, no man can avoid reaching
the end of his life.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And then I realized, this wasn’t the end of
my life.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This isn’t how I die.</p>
<p><strong>a deep voice</strong>: Friend!</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What happened to your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They got ahead of me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but Josephine
has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Really! That’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I spent a week in Morocco for the story.
It was incredible.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: We’ll have to pick up a copy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t know if you’re aware of this,
Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo – they
speak only French.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re lucky to get four words out of them
in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you’d hear them
speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything:
politics, movies, fashion – everything but religion.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why not religion, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s rude to talk about religion. You never
know who you’re going to offend.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Josephine actually went to the Congo last
year.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh, so you know.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom, would you say you understand Dad?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What I mean is, do you really know what’s
going on in his head?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask
him a question and suddenly it’s another one of his stories. You can’t
honestly say you know him.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Yes, Will, I do. And don’t presume things
you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Would you say you understand Josephine?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes. But that’s a different…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No it’s not. It’s exactly the same. Your
father and I met, we dated, and we married – we chose each other –
because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the
same as you two.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Josephine and I have a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very
smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as
someone’s wife. And I’ve been his wife longer than I’ve been your
mother. You can’t discount that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: True. But I’ve known him my whole life, and I
don’t feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I know it’s not easy. Just remember, he
didn’t choose to be your father and you didn’t choose to be his son. You
just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and
it’d be just the same. If you ask me, it’s a wonder parents and children
can stand each other at all.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But I understand you, Mom. I always have.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Well, clearly you don’t. But I’m not the
mystery you’re trying to solve right now.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Before I forget, your father has papers in
the basement I’d like you to go through. I wouldn’t know what’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Was she one of your teachers?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. But it’s weird. She seemed to recognize
me.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Do you know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Never seen her before. Pretty, though.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Hi. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: What were you dreaming about?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t usually remember unless they’re
especially portentous. You know what that word means, portentous?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Means when you dream about something that’s
going to happen. Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and
told me, “Your Aunt is going to die.” I was so scared I woke up my
parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the
next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: That’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Terrible for her, but think about me, young
boy with that kind of power. Wasn’t three weeks later that the crow came
back to me in a dream and said, “Your Grampa is going to die.” Well, I
ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I
could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my
Grampa was dead.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: For the next couple weeks, I didn’t have
another dream. Until one night the crow came back and said, “Your Daddy
is going to die.” Well, I didn’t know what to do. But finally I told my
father. And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled. That
next day, he wasn’t himself, always looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head. Because the crow didn’t tell how it was
going to happen, just those words: your Daddy is going to die. Well, he
went into town early and was gone for a long time. And when he finally
came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall
all day. He said to my mother, “Good God. I just had the worst day of my
life.” “You think you’ve had a bad day,” she said. “This morning the
milkman dropped dead on the porch!” Josephine smiles, a half-laugh,
which gets him smiling too.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Because see, my mother was banging the
milkman.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: No, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He was slipping her a little extra
cream.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He was filling her basket. He was making
deliveries around back.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her
churn. Splashing milk in her box.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the
bottles. Licking the popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Cracking the eggs and making an omelet.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Spooning the sherbet.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Can I take your picture?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You don’t need a picture. Just look up
handsome in the dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I have photos from the wedding to show
you. There’s a great one of you and my father. I had an extra print
made.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I’ve never seen any.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s because we didn’t have a wedding.
Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to
somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I never knew.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Will never told you that? Probably just as
well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of
the flavor.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Oh, so this is a tall tale?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well, it’s not a short one.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I had just left Ashton, and was on my way to
discover my destiny. Not knowing what that would be exactly, I explored
every opportunity that presented itself.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think you’ve
seen the unusual. You may think you’ve seen the bizarre. But I’ve
travelled to the five corners of the world, and let me tell you, I’ve
never seen anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: When I found this man, he was picking oranges
in Florida. His fellow workers called him El Penumbra – The Shadow –
because when you were working beside him, he blocked out the daylight.
He could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit. I had
to pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I could take him with me.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Not to alarm you, Ma’am. But if this man
wanted to, he could crush your head between his toes. But he won’t. He’s
not going to hurt her, folks, because he’s our own Gentle Giant. Ladies
and Gentlemen, I give you Colossus!</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: What’s his name? Does he talk? It’s not
important.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Karl.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of the term
“involuntary servitude?”</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: “Unconscionable contract?”</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Great, great. That’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was on that night Karl met his destiny.
And I met mine. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They say when you meet the love of your
life, time stops. And that’s true. What they don’t tell you, is that
once time starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a
star.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p>****: My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: What’s the matter with you, kid? I haven’t
seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer’s
wife. Get it? “Depressed?”</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: See! The big guy likes it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I just saw the woman I’m going to marry, I
know it. But then I lost her.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Tough break. Most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m going to spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde
hair, blue hat?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: I know her uncle. Friends of the family.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Who is she? Where does she live?</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Kid. Don’t waste your time. She’s out of your
league.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you mean? You don’t even know
me.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Sure I do. You were hot shit back in
Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don’t have a
plan. You don’t have a job. You don’t have anything but the clothes on
your back.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ve got a whole backpack full of
clothes!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Someone stole my backpack.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This
here is the ocean, and you’re drowning. Take my advice and go back to
Puddleville. You’ll be happy there.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wait. You said I don’t have a plan. I do.
I’m going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life
with her.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t have a job, but I would have a job
if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more
determination than any man you’re ever going to meet.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Sorry, kid. I don’t do charity.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll work night and day, and you won’t have
to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Every month you work for me, I’ll tell you one
thing about her. That’s my final offer.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn’t. I’d go three days
without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The only thing that kept me going was the
promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mr. Calloway! It’s been a month today.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: This girl, the love of your life. Her favorite
flower is daffodils.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Daffodils. Daffodils!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Daffodils!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: True to his word, every month Amos would
tell me something new about the woman of my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: College! She’s going to college!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Music! She likes music. I like music
too!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Over the months, I learned a lot about the
woman I was going to marry, but not her name, and not where to find
her.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mr. Calloway! It’s Edward Bloom. I need to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No, wait!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It was that night I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the
social niceties.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Didn’t kill anything, did I?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: A few rabbits, but I think one of them was
already dead.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: That would explain the indigestion.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: I was wrong about you kid. You may not have
much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There’s only one I want.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Her name is Sandra Templeton. She’s going to
Auburn. The semester’s almost over, so you better hurry.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>amos</strong>: Good luck, kid.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: After saying my goodbyes, I hopped three
trains to get to Auburn that afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You don’t know me, but my name is Edward
Bloom and I am in love with you. I’ve spent the last three years working
to find out who you are. I’ve been shot and stabbed and trampled a few
times, had my ribs broken twice, but it’s all worth it to see you here,
now, and to finally get to talk to you. Because I am destined to marry
you. I knew that from the first moment I saw you at the circus. And I
know it now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t need to apologize to me. I mean, I’m
the luckiest person you’re going to find today…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: No I’m sorry, I… I’m engaged to be
married.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: But you’re wrong. I do know you, at least by
reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I’m actually engaged to a boy
from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well. Congratulations. I’m sorry to have
bothered you.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Stop it. It’s not funny. That poor boy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fate has a cruel way of circling around on
you. After all this work to leave Ashton, the girl I loved was now
engaged to one of its biggest jerks.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There’s a time when a man needs to fight,
and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the
ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The truth is, I’ve always been a fool.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I am going
to marry you!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Daffodils?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: They’re your favorite flower.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How did you get so many?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I called everywhere in five states and
explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You don’t even know me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have the rest of my life to find out.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: Sandra!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It’s Don. Promise me you won’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: If that’s what you want, I swear to it.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: Bloom!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: What the hell are you doing? This is my
girl. Mine!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I didn’t know she belonged to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: What the matter, Bloom? Too scared to
fight back?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I promised I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: While I took the beating of a lifetime, it
was Don Price who was ultimately defeated.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: All the physical activity had worsened a
congenital valve defect. Put simply, his heart wasn’t strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Don!</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I will never marry you.</p>
<p><strong>don price</strong>: What. You love this guy?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He’s almost a stranger and I prefer him to
you.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: How can I convince you to stop?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Go out with me.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep
her same date at the chapel. Only the groom had changed.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I thought you said you didn’t have a
church wedding.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well, we were all set to, but there was a
complication.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Is it the medicine that’s making you
thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Truth is, I’ve been thirsty my whole life.
Never really known why.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There was one time when I was eleven…</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You were talking about your wedding.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I didn’t forget. I was just working on a
tangent. See, most men, they’ll tell a story straight through, and it
won’t be complicated, but it won’t be interesting either.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I like your stories.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And I like you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now. The thing about working for a circus is
you don’t have a regular address, and after three years I had a lot of
undelivered mail.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: During the four weeks I was in the hospital,
the postmaster finally caught up with me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It turned out that while my heart belonged
to Sandra, the rest of my body belonged to the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: A hitch in the Army was up to three years at
that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I
couldn’t survive being away from her that long. So I took every
hazardous assignment I could find, with the hope of getting my time down
to less than a year.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: Sometimes a girl can feel so alone Without a
lover to call her own. Sometimes it’s so bad, she wants to explode.
Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: But she won’t. No, she can’t. She needs a
special special different unusual man. Because that girl, Who looks like
me, She has wants, but she has needs.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: Any of you got needs?</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: I’ve had twice the adventure, Cried double the
tears. Two times the bad times in half the years. I need a strong man,
because I’ve got Twice the love to give.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: Say hello, Jing.</p>
<p><strong>jing</strong>: Hello Jing.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: I’m Ping. She’s Jing. She’s the good one. I’m
the bad one.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: How could you miss your cue? You make me look
like a fool, out there alone.</p>
<p><strong>jing</strong>: You weren’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: Damn right you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>jing</strong>: Tell your men not to bother us! And lock that
door!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Please, I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: What makes you think we’ll help you?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Over the next hour, I described my love for
Sandra Kay Templeton, and the ordeal that brought me before them. As it
had always been, this love was my salvation. It was destined to be.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We put together an elaborate plan for
escape, involving a whaling ship to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a small,
dirty canoe to Miami. We all knew it would be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: And what are we supposed to do when we get to
America?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I can get you bookings. I know the biggest
man in show business.</p>
<p><strong>jing</strong>: Bob Hope?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bigger.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And so the twins and I began our arduous
journey halfway around the world. Unfortunately, there was no way to
send a message back to America.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And so it was no surprise that the Army
believed I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: After four months, Sandra had gotten over
the worst of the nightmares. When the phone rang, she didn’t think it
was somehow me calling her. When a car drove past, she didn’t get up to
check out the window.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I talked with your father last night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You never told me how your parents
met.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They met at Auburn.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: What about the details? How they fell in
love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s because most of it never happened.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: But it’s romantic.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Mmm, what?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance
with a French woman.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Do you love your father?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Everyone loves my father. He’s a very likeable
guy.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Do you love him?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You have to understand. When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking – maybe he has
a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He
leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never
wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life
better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can’t
stand this boring place.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: But it’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is “true?” I’ve never heard my father say
a single true thing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Look, I know why you like him. I know why
everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I need you on my side.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I am always on your side. And I think you
should talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Did I ever tell you about how…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I think someone hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: The tree fell on the car, spilling the
syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off
with the whole car.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: But the real story is how I got the car. You
see…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Son?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can we talk?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’m going to get started on dishes.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were
hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn’t count on
an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m trying to make a metaphor here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Then you shouldn’t have started with a
question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have
started with, “The thing about icebergs is…”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The thing about icebergs is you only see 10
percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can’t
see it. And that’s what it is with you Dad. I’m only seeing this little
bit that sticks above the water.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What, you’re seeing down to my nose? My
chin?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have no idea who you are because you have
never told me a single fact.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ve told you a thousand facts. That’s all I
do, Will. I tell stories.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies.
Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They’re not
elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and
twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your
stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that
everything you said was impossible – everything! – I felt like such a
fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
combined. Just as charming and just as fake.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You think I’m fake.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Only on the surface. But that’s all I’ve ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad, I’m about to have a kid of my own here.
It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding
me.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It would kill you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What do you want, Will? Who do you want me
to be?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me
who you are for once.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I have been nothing but myself since the day
I was born. And if you can’t see that, it’s your failing, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Your father decided he needed to have an
office, and it wouldn’t do to have it in the house. You’ll know better
than me what’s important.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: It was during the war. Your father went
missing. They thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That really happened?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Not everything your father says is a
complete fabrication.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I’m going to check on him.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I need to lie down for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: After the war, the sons of Alabama returned
home, looking for work. Each had an advantage over me. They were alive,
while I was – officially – deceased.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: With my prospects few, I took a job as a
travelling salesman. It suited me. If there’s one thing you can say
about Edward Bloom, it’s that I am a social person.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ve travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu,
and if there’s one thing people have in common, is we could all use a
hand around the house.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why, with this product you can…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch yourself
while wearing mittens. Hold a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog away from
kittens. It’s strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at
all.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You can use it to point out important
information. Or dangers. Or beautiful women.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We’re still working on that one.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Soon I added other products, and other
cities, until my territory stretched from the coast to western
Texas.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I could be gone for weeks at a time. But
every other Friday, I’d put all the money I’d made into an account set
aside for a proper house with a white picket fence.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Edward? Edward Bloom?</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: It’s me. Norther Winslow.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was astonished to see the greatest poet of
both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: I want you to know, when you left
Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was
not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South
America. Every day a new adventure, that’s my motto.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: That’s great, Norther. I’m happy for you. I
can’t believe I helped.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So what are you up to now?</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: I’m robbing this place.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Would you mind grabbing that?</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Now, I want all of you to lie down.
I’m gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is
going to handle the vault. You help my friend, okay?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Look, I’m really sorry. I just don’t want
anybody to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>teller woman</strong>: It’s not that, it’s just…</p>
<p><strong>teller woman</strong>: …there’s no money. We’re completely
bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It turned out the savings and loan had
already been robbed – not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas
real estate.</p>
<p><strong>teller woman</strong>: You gotta promise you won’t tell
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred
dollars! Not bad for just the drawers. Let’s see what you got from the
vault.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: This is it? The whole vault.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: ’Fraid so.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Edward, it’s got your deposit slip
on it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Look, I just didn’t want you to go
empty-handed. There’s something you should know, Norther. You see, the
reason why…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas
oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly
vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: I should go to Wall Street. That’s
where all the money is.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I knew then that while my days as a criminal
were over, Norther’s were just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>norther winslow</strong>: Edward, thank you for the hand!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: When Norther made his first million dollars,
he sent me a check for ten thousand. I protested, but he said it was my
fee as his career advisor.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most
men. But it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket
fence.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And for that, it was all the riches a man
could ever want.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I was drying out.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I see. We need to get you one of those plant
misters. We can spray you like a fern.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Come now.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I don’t think I’ll ever dry out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Is he awake?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: He just fell asleep. Josephine’s with
him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you and Dad have any other property?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I suppose your grandmother’s house when she
passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought
it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So you never bought any land.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Heavens no. We had a hard enough time
keeping the mortgage on this place.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Go back to the start. Right hand
only.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I wasn’t expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you Jenny Hill?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I am. And you’re Will. I’ve seen your
picture, that’s how I recognize you. I almost said something at the
store, but it would have been awkward. Like this.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Listen, Kenny. Why don’t we skip the lesson
today? We can go again next week.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Do I have to give it back to my Mom?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I won’t tell her if you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How did you know my father?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This was on his sales route, so he was
through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Were you and my father having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting
to dance around this for another half hour.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve seen him with women. He flirts. He always
has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just
never had proof.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can I ask you a question? Why did you come
here today? If you found this deed, why didn’t you just ask Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Because he’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Look, I don’t know how much you want to know
about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be
wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father talked about a lot of things he
never did, and I’m sure he did a lot of things he never talked about.
I’m just trying to reconcile the two.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The first thing you have to understand, is
that your father never meant to end up here. And yet he did, twice. The
first time, he was early. The second time, he was late.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Those days, your father was working for
himself. If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it’s
that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him. One night
he was returning from three weeks on the road, when he hit a
thunderstorm unlike any in his life.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and
taking him by surprise.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: A man sees things differently at different
times in his life. This town didn’t seem the same now that he was
older.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: A new road had brought the outside world to
Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt. Almost everywhere you
looked, people were bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Two different corporations were looking at
buying the town, if they could get the price low enough. One wanted to
open a chicken processing plant. The other, a municipal dump. Either
way, Spectre would be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fifty-thousand!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And so Edward Bloom decided to buy the town,
in order to save it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He was never a wealthy man, but he had made
other men rich, and now he asked for their favors.</p>
<p><strong>various shots</strong>: Expressive and passionate as always,
Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Most of them had never seen Spectre – they
only had Edward’s words to describe it. That’s all they needed. He sold
them on the dream.</p>
<p><strong>jing</strong>: You can structure it as a historical trust.
But you’ll need every contiguous piece of property. It’s all or
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: So first he bought the farms. Then he bought
the houses. Then he bought the stores.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Whatever he bought, the people were not asked
to leave or pay rent or anything. They were just asked to keep doing as
they were doing. In that way, he could make sure the town would never
die.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Within six months, his trust had purchased
the entire town. With one exception.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You must be Edward Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No one would come out here unless they had
business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You’re
buying the town.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Apparently I’ve overlooked this one piece of
it, and I’d like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be
preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll offer you more than it’s worth. And you
know you won’t have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the
deed, you have my word.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Now let me get this straight. You’ll buy the
swamp from me, but I’ll stay in it. You’ll own the house, but it’ll
still be mine. I’ll be here, and you’ll come and go as you please to one
place or another. Do I have that right?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: In so many words, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Then I don’t think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing
is going to change, I’d just as soon it not change in the way it hasn’t
been changing all this time.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: It’s not like you’re going to lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town. I’ve been nothing if not generous. I want
the best for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land? Some
sort of midlife crisis? Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a
town?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Helping people makes me happy.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m not convinced you should be happy.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m sorry. Have I offended you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, you did exactly what you promised. You
came back. I was just expecting you sooner.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re Beamen’s daughter. Your last name is
different. You married.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big
difference.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I won’t be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I see. I thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s okay, just leave it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I can get it. I can just…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Lord, I’m sorry I…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Please. Go. Just go.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Most men in that situation would accept their
failure and move on. But Edward was not like most men.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: As the months passed, he found more and more
things to fix, until the shack no longer resembled itself.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Of course, the best part was creating new
material. By the time the twins and I got to Havana, we had a whole new
routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I suppose I should…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You can leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Don’t. Don’t be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that… I am in love with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: And from the moment I saw her until the
moment I die, she’s the only one.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’m sorry, Jenny. I am.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Wait! Edward!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: One day, Edward Bloom left, and never
returned to the town he’d saved.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: As for the girl, the common belief was that
she’d become a witch, and crazy at that. She became something of a
legend herself.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And the story ended where it began.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Logically, you couldn’t be the Witch, because
she was old back when he was young.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, it’s logical if you think like your
father. See, to him, there’s only two women: your mother and everyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You didn’t become crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was
in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy
tale.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: People aren’t like they are in stories. They
hurt each other without meaning to. They are kind and unbelievably cruel
at the same moment. Like me, now. I’m not sure I should have told you
any of this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, I wanted to know. I’m glad I know.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I wanted to meet you for the longest time. I
did. I envied you so much. The way Eddie would talk about you when you
were at Missouri, that award you won. Congratulations, incidentally. And
when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you. I
mean, that’s the thing. Every moment he loved you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: And as brightly as the sun would shine when
he was with me, every time he left it disappeared. I wanted to be as
important to him as you were, and I was never going to be. I was
make-believe and his other life, you, were real.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You knew that, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hello? Mom? Dad?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Your father had a stroke. He’s upstairs
with your mom and Dr. Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Is he going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What I mean is, will he get back to the way he
was when…</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: No. He won’t. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I don’t suppose one of us could stay with
him. In case he… In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll stay. Why don’t you go home with
Josephine and I’ll stay tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: That’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: You’ll call if…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I will. I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mom, do you want some time with Dad?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I’m sorry. It seems every hour I have
to…</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I know. It was the same when I was carrying
Will. Like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Do you like it, being pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved
every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone,
but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of
his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: I really miss that.</p>
<p><strong>josephine</strong>: Don’t stop. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Glad to see you’re not trying to have a
heartfelt talk. It’s one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to
those who can’t hear them.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My father and I have an advantage. We never
talk.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How long have you known my father?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Thirty years. Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How would you describe him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated
hypertension. How would his son describe him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Did your father ever tell you about the
day you were born?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable
fish.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Not that one. The real story. Did he
ever tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Your mother came in about three in the
afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on
business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no
complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to
miss it, but it wasn’t the custom for the men to be in the room for
deliveries then, so I can’t see as it would have been much different had
he been there. And that’s the real story of how you were born.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Not very exciting, is it? And I suppose
if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one
involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version.
But that’s just me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What can I do? Can I help? Can I get you
something? Water?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The river.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The river?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Tell me how it happens.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How what happens?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How I go.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You mean what you saw in The Eye?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t know that story, Dad. You never told
me that one.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how
it starts.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Okay. It’s morning, and you and I are in the
hospital. I’d fallen asleep in the chair. I wake up and I see you,
and…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Somehow, you’re better. Different. You’re
getting ready to go. And I say…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dad, you’re in no condition to…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: There’s a fold-up wheelchair in the
bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me. As soon as we get off this floor,
we’ll be in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hurry! We don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>dr. bennett</strong>: Will! I… What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Security! Stop them!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No time to explain! Follow us!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I pick you up and you hardly weigh anything. I
can’t explain it.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Water. I need water.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Leave it! We won’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And we have to take Glenville to avoid all the
church traffic, because those damn church people drive too slow.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I ask…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where are we headed?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You say…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The River!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: As we get closer to the river, we see
everybody’s already there. And I mean everybody.</p>
<p><strong>ping</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Story of my life.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And the strange thing is, there’s not a sad
face to be found. Everyone’s just so glad to see you, and send you off
right.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We’ll miss
you!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My girl in the river.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You become what you always were. A very big
fish. And that’s the way it happens.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Have you ever heard a joke so many times
you’ve forgotten why it’s funny? But then you hear it again and suddenly
it’s new. You remember why you loved it in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: So he said he’d fight the giant who was fifteen
feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Dad, that’s right, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: See. So he was a giant but my grampa was going
to fight him because he wasn’t afraid of anything because he’d seen how
he was going to die in this old lady’s glass eye…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That was my father’s final joke I guess. A man
tells his stories so many times he becomes the stories. They live on
after him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And in that way, he becomes immortal.</p>
