<p><strong>superimpose</strong>: Presenter credit.</p>
<p><strong>clock</strong>: Tick, tock, seven o’clock. Time to rise and
open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clock</strong>: Tick, tock, seven-oh-one. Time to get up, the
day had begun.</p>
<p><strong>clock</strong>: Tick, tock –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I dreamed about Mars again… it was bizarre,
yet is was so real…</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: It’s your time of the month again.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: At least once a month. Douglas Quail’s
obsession. For twelve years you’ve been talking about Mars.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: People do go to Mars, you know.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: That’s right, Douglas. But not you. Not
us.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: As it is, we can barely scrape by on your
lousy ten thousand a week.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: What do they expect … the way men dress
these days … then they scream rape.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You know – let’s really do it.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Rape men in the park?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: No. Go to Mars.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: We can pool our savings and I’ve got some
sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation…</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: …more of a half-wit. For a start a war
could break out there any day …</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: That’s just media talk. They’re… …just a
minority. They’re powerless.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Well, there’s a lot of things we need
around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars. We’re broke.
I’m just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a
better job….</p>
<p><strong>clock</strong>: It’s now eight. You’ll be late!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’ll be late!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No weapon again, Mr. Quail?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I keep forgetting, Herb. They frighten
me.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeah? Well, it’s the law, Mr. Quail. Has been
since 1990 they tell me. Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get
reported.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Okay. Herb, okay.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: – more violence today from Mars’s
strike-torn ore colonies –</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …but Earth Intelligence Operations
Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars’s all
important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident
groups….</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: We’re dealing with a bunch of extremists
and unrepresentative lunatics. Mars is a happy and prosperous
protectorate of Earth… and will remain so.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: There have been some criticisms, sir….</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: I have no further comment.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Good morning, commuters. This portion of
your trip is brought to you by Rekall, Inc. Do you have a dream that
never came true? Do you aspire - but only perspire? Has the great
adventure passed you by? Then come to… REKALL, where what might have
been will have been. For the memories of a lifetime… REKALL.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But… is the process really that effective? A
false memory!?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Is it in any way dangerous? I mean, the
medical techniques?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: It’s just - incredible.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But… I’ll know I hired you. That’ll destroy
the whole illusion.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I won’t?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: “Intelligence Agent”… wouldn’t that be
dangerous? I might attack….</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I don’t know… about the whole thing… it’s all
such a fake. I won’t really have gone. I won’t really….</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You know that’s illegal.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Yeah? Who’s going to report me? You?…
wimp….</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Screwing around’s illegal, too. But just
give me half a chance…</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Hi, I’m Doctor Sophie Lull. Sorry I’m
late. I’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: instrument</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: It the Pope Martian?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Okay – that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Now, just relax, kid. This ain’t gonna hurt.
Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you’re under, I’ll just ask ya
a few questions, nothin’ real personal, just full details of yer private
life so’s we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: See? Painless. I didn’t feel a thing. Hey,
you’re a nice kid… you like a little somethin’ extra?</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Good! Kid – have I got a girl for you! She’s
gonna like you. You’re good-lookin’. Gettin’ sleepy? Good. Now, what’s
the first thing you think of when you’re thinkin’ about Mars?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Well… I’d like to see the Martian Sphinx…</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Okay – you will, Dougle! I want ya to start
counting backwards from a hundred for me.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: One hundred… ninety-nine… ninety-eight…
ninety-seven… ninety-six… ninety-five….</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars; number
sixty-two… and throw in that blonde… We’ll give him a real good
time.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Sixty-two… and… the blonde…</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Boy, is this one wild. He won’t want to come
back.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Dougie? This Sophie Lull. Can ya hear me?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: …Sophie….</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Good! … I’m gonna ask ya a few more questions
now. Ya think you’ll be able to answer ’em?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: …Yes….</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Attaboy! To begin with, I wanna ask ya; – You
sex life. How many orgasms a week?</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Howie? Listen, you’d better get in here.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: You’d better get in here.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Quail? Dougie, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Tell McClane what you told us.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: All of you in this room are dead.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You’ve broken my cover.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: The Narkadine cracked a memory cap. Mars –
He’s really been there.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: With spontaneous breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You’ve compromised the Sphinx Project. You’ll
have to be silenced.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: My name isn’t Quail.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I believe you, but that won’t stop E.T.O.
from killing you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Killing you… killing you… killing you….</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: He wants a false memory implanted – of a trip
he really took. Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his
memory. All he know was going to Mars meant something special to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: What do we do? Graft a false memory pattern
over the real memory of the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Uh-uh… That could promote a partial
breakthrough of the real trip.</p>
<p><strong>lull</strong>: Why don’t we just wipe out the memory of his
visit here?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Travelling south along Third Avenue, passing
Fourty-third street.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Where am I going?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Thirty-three thirteen “G” Street, Sector
“L”, Twin Towers, Apartment six-thirty- five.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: How did I get here?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I don not understand the question, sir or
madam.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: How did I get into this cab?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You stepped into it in the normal manner,
sir or madam.</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: Aren’t you the man from Mars?</p>
<p><strong>2nd agent</strong>: Don’t give us a reason to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Mr. Zimmer…Mr. Zimmer… help me… they’re…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: You told everyone at Rekall about you
trip to Mars. Where you went, who you worked for, what you did –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But I didn’t… Are you telling me… I did go to
Mars? I don’t remember?</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: You’ve remembered too much. The Sphinx
Project, for a start….</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: remembers only</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: They’ve been taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What are you going to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: My God! No! You’re going to kill me!</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: No one’s going to kill you if We’re
visiting E.I.O. for some new tests. Now get in, or do we start playing
rough?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: No! It’s not my fault! You can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Wait a minute, I remember –</p>
<p><strong>1st agent</strong>: What, Quail? What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: On Mars… they tried to kill me… And….</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Did you know I’ve been to Mars?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: What! This stupid obsess…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I think I’ve been. I vaguely recall…</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Doug, you’ve got to forget…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Forget? Remembering is the problem I must’ve
been to one of those artificial memory places…</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But something went wrong… something about a
real memory… and then those men… tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: What men? Doug, you’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: You’re here now. They didn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: No. That’s what’s so amazing. I killed them.
I think…</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Where? Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Doug! It’s something they put into your
mind at the memory place. Fantasies. That’s their business.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: You’re a computer operator. You’re a bore.
You’re a wimp. You’re not a killer.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m involved somehow with E.I.O. It’s true.
It’s no fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Doug, I want you to see a doctor. Now Alec
and Shirley Turnbull have a good man. He helped Alec through his
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: For fuck’s sake, this is no breakdown!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: My God! Did you say I need a
psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: I haven’t seen you move that fast since
I’ve known you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: How could you do it? After eight years!</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: I’m not your wife, Quail.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Not my wife! You are out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: nursing her</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Why are you lying like this?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: No, Quail. It’s true. You work for E.I.O.
So do I.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But why all of this?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: We had to watchdog you…make sure the
erasure took. A wife seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But I remember it! All of it!… Us!</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: All implanted.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Our friends… my work… eight years.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: The job’s real – you’ve had is six weeks –
since you got back from Mars.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: It’s all a fabrication, Quail. Everything
you know.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: This is crazy! If all my memories are false,
who am I? What am I? Jesus… it’s like I don’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: You exist, all right. That’s the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Why did you try to kill me? Why does E.I.O.
want me dead?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: They don’t particularly. That was my idea.
This assignment was boring me to death. The personality they gave you
wasn’t too thrilling.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Well, what did I do on Mars that they have to
keep me from telling?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: I’ve no idea. I just work here.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: All right… I’m leaving. Don’t try and follow
me –</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: I don’t have to follow you. You can’t get
away from E.I.O. Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife
– type casting.</p>
<p><strong>first gunman</strong>: Fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>second gunman</strong>: We won’t be able to track him again
until he comes up above ground!</p>
<p><strong>tv as voice over</strong>: Tired? Exhausted? Need a vacation?
Don’t settle for memories, experience the real thing. Daily departures
on the space shuttle to Mars. Visit the wonders of….</p>
<p><strong>earplug wearer</strong>: Coming in again. Loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>robot driver</strong>: You are being fired on, sir or madam,
please leave the cab at once.</p>
<p><strong>robot driver</strong>: …leave the cab as bullets are hitting
the vehicle in considerable quantities.</p>
<p><strong>robot driver</strong>: This company, sir or madam, will
institute legal action for damages…</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: A room for the night.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: putting down</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Here’s ten thousand. Forget the ID.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I have a liaison with a lady… and I’m
married…</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I understand, sir. Nothing like a bit on
the side, eh? Bit of fugitive flesh. The greatest aphrodisiac is a new
body, wouldn’t you say, sir?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I told you, I don’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: If you want to live, don’t hand
up.</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: They’ve got you bugged… They’re
gonna find you. Faster than you can say “Back Rodgers”. And don’t bother
shaking down your clothes – the monitor is embedded in your skull.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Who are you? What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: Take a wet towel and wrap it around
your head. That will deaden the signal. It’ll take longer for them to
pinpoint you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Why should I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: There’s a real old saying -
“Beggars can’t be choosers”. Go and soak your head!</p>
<p><strong>earphone wearer</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Cut the language, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>earphone wearer</strong>: It’s gone! Some…malfunction…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Toldya the Martian assembled</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: Head over to Skid Row – to the
Lucky Stub Pawnshop – corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth. Tell the
man you’re Mr. Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What do I want with Grecian candlesticks!</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: Just do it! This is no time for
small talk.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: How did you know where to find me?</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: I’ve been tailing you since you get
back from Mars.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You’re E.I.O. You’re on the other team.</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: I’m E.I.O. But I was your best
friend. Scott Stevens - we arranged this…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I can’t remember - only bits…</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: I was your fail-safe – if and when
the shooting started. Good luck. Look me up if you remember me.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Well, look at that. He’s really got his
hands full.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Not so full, so I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>earphone wearer</strong>: Quick. The guy who checked in
fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Room…thirty-six.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: He was only meeting a lady… Aren’t you guys
overdoing it a bit?</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: You wanta camera? I got some good,
top-quality ones. You want silk rugs? Handmade last century in Iran…all
perfect. You want videos? Old movies… classics…all those Vietnam war
ones…real quaint stuff… you want…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m Hotchkiss…I came for the…Grecian
candlesticks…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I wonder if you could tell me…</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: I trust these will look well in you…
mosque.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Martian money….</p>
<p><strong>thin air and stand there in the room a few feet away
from</strong>: QUAIL: he’s an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail –
down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>cassette voice</strong>: “Hauser, this is Hauser – or
whatever you think your name is now. If you’re listening to this, I’m
talking to myself. Your memory’s been erased and you’ve got a wet towel
around your head.”The first thing you’ve got to do is get rid of that
bug in your head.”</p>
<p><strong>cassette voice</strong>: The monitoring device is located in
your left maxillary sinus cavity. Make a small incision in your neck
just below the left ear, and insert the wire up into the sinus. The head
is self-guiding. Just shove.</p>
<p><strong>cassette voice</strong>: You won’t feel a thing. The spray
cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant. Careful,
it’s my neck, too.</p>
<p><strong>earplug wearer</strong>: It’s come on again.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>earplug wearer</strong>: He’s in that old flophouse. Plaza
Hotel. Central Park South.</p>
<p><strong>earplug wearer</strong>: Boy, he’s really moving around.</p>
<p><strong>earplug wearer</strong>: Ya dirty rat!</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: We’re running every one of his memory
tapes for the past fifteen years. Nothing yet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: There must be something – some place he
would go, some friend he would run to.</p>
<p><strong>red-headed man</strong>: They lost him.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Again?!</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Are you sure the original suppression
took?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Absolutely, sir. He thinks he’s Quail, a
computer…</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Then how do you explain what he’s
doing?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Just his instincts. He was well trained
by E.I.O…. Maybe the memory cap’s fractured. Portions of his prior
identity could be leaking through.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: He’ll remember Mars? The Sphinx
Project?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Fragments. Nothing more. Nothing he
could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than
implanting an identify alternative.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: What do you think I am? A barbarian? We’re
not living in the twentieth century!</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Hold it there.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes man #1</strong>: If he had to travel to Mars
with that bunch, I’d be sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes man #2</strong>: We couldn’t have missed
him?</p>
<p><strong>plainclothes man #1</strong>: No way. Let’s get a coffee
before the next shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, if you’ll
glance out the starboard viewports, you’ll behold an indeed awesome
sight –</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Those long gorges you see, clearly
are the legendary canals of Mars….</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Of course, they are not manmade
canals, but vast natural chasms …many deeper and larger than the Grand
Canyon. Though utterly without moisture now, scientists have determined
that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: Surface temperatures at the Martian
equator is minus one-hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade – in winter.
Fortunately, this time of year it’s slightly more seasonable: Sixty
degrees, Fahrenheit, outside the domes. Please remember, folks, that
outside the domes you’ll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply
at all times. The atmosphere of Mars is almost a vacuum. Thank you for
flying with Interstellar and we hope your stay will be a pleasant
one.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: It’s no Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><strong>tour organiser</strong>: No. Quite a bit to see, though. The
canyons, the old Sphinx…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>tour oraniser</strong>: Not much, really. Millions of years
old. Bit like the one that used to be in Egypt, you know…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yeah. Got destroyed in the Arab wars… What
about this independence movement?</p>
<p><strong>tour organiser</strong>: Not worth worrying about. Mostly
descendants of the original colonists from Earth. Now they want
self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals… I don’t think we’ve met.
You with our group? Takes me a while to know everyone.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Sure. Douglas Quail.</p>
<p><strong>tour organiser</strong>: Richard Toltz. Well, Doug, I hope
we’ll see a lot more of each other.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Smogpsucker!</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You know how it is, sir. Some of these
red-asses are a bit prejudiced.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Prejudiced? Against what?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Earthmen.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What are they singing?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: The Martian National Anthem.</p>
<p><strong>canned voice</strong>: “…the Martian Sphinx… only evidence of
non-human civilization ever discovered …age estimated at over eighteen
million years…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Nice to have you back with us,
Mr. Hauser.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Nice to be back. I’m flattered you remember
me.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Part of my job, sir.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Do you remember my first name, too?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Charles. Charles Hauser, right?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m impressed. Listen. I need transportation
to the… uh… the Sphinx. Can you arrange it for me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. But Earth government has
sealed off the excavation site completely. No one but survey teams and
archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Oh… Do you want the item you left with
us?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What item? Oh… yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>“melina noel</strong>: Last Chance Air Station</p>
<p><strong>calypso guy</strong>: Need a cab, boss mon?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Mine’s right around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: That one’s closer.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: But I out-hustle him, right?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: …if that intergalactic little Napoleon
thinks I’m sellin’ and clearin’ outta here, he can think again!</p>
<p><strong>miner #2</strong>: …watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air,
Luke?</p>
<p><strong>miner #3</strong>: …you’ll be breathin’ red dust and shittin’
bricks.</p>
<p><strong>miner #4</strong>: …my wife ain’t goin’ on one of those space
shuttles… she hates flyin’…</p>
<p><strong>miner #5</strong>: …aw, come on… flyin’s safer’n crossin’ the
road…</p>
<p><strong>miner #6</strong>: …yeah, there ain’t been a real disaster
since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago…</p>
<p><strong>miner #4</strong>: …well, that killed twelve thousand…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What is this, Bennie… Tombstone?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Sorta. Bunch of miners out here got their
own claims, from way back. Cohaagen’s buyin’ em all up, says he’s gonna
cut off the air an’ water if they won’t sell…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m looking for Melina Noel.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You’ve found her.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p>****: As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: You bastard…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: That’s new – the innocent look. You didn’t
have that one before. Well?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Well, uh… I…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: All right, I’ll say it for you.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Don’t worry. I got the note. You discharged
your obligation.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What note?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Oh, the usual one. “Must return immediately
to Earth… the wife needs me…”</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I don’t have a wife. Well, I do - but not a
real wife. Hell… look… someone else sent that note. Someone who –</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: What are you here for?!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: For you! I don’t even know why –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Whoever I was, I must have been a helluva
guy.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: “Whoever you were”???</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Listen. I’ve for to tell you something. I beg
you to believe me… help me –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Something happened to my mind. Memory
suppression, false implant, I don’t know what –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What I’m saying is… I don’t remember you. I
don’t remember us. I don’t remember me –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Who is us?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Memory erasure is what they use on agents.
Go away.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Wait… I was an agent – I’m not now – just
tell me who I am! How did we know each other? Why are they trying to
kill me?!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: I’m not trusting you again.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You loved me once, you must have –</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: That you was a liar. Who you are now I don’t
even know.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Please, Melina –</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I need your help –</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Get out! Get the hell away from me!</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You don’t look so good, boss. All over the
Universe, women is an awful curse.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: It’s a tough planet, boss.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Some guy really screwed her - screwed her up
real good. Some Earthman. Just hopped on a space shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Listen, Bennie. You’re pretty well
informed?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: If that means I know it all, you’re right,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What do you know about the Sphinx?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: I don’t know nothin’. Not about the Sphinx.
That’s out of the ball park.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I have to get there. Can’t you help me?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: No can do, mon. You want women, cigarettes,
red-market money, booze, even air or water… Bennie’s your man. But the
Sphinx… that’s</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Well… look at that one, eh?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Big cheese in town. Big smelly cheese.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Cohaagen? But isn’t he often here?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: No way. That cat just cheat the Martian
workers without ever leavin’ his place in Beverly Hills. Somethin’ must
be cookin’.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Hauser…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you… about
Douglas Quail.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall,
Incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Rekall??</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes. It’s difficult to explain… Could you
open the door, please? I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: Hello, Mr. Quail. May I come in? I won’t be
offended if you prefer to keep the gun you’re holding trained on me.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: All right… come in.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: My card, Mr. Quail.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Okay – so you’re Doctor George Edgemar of
‘Rekall, Inc.’ So?</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: As I said… this is going to be very
difficult – for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: Mr. Quail… I’m afraid you’re not really
standing here at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Sat that again.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: I said, you’re not really here. Neither am
I. We’re both in the Memory Studio – in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Are you trying to tell me that this is all
part of some… artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left
Earth?</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: No, not quite. We didn’t give you this.
You’re creating it yourself – Remember the option we offered you?
Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on
it. What you’re experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you
yourself are fabricating.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What is this shit you’re giving me?</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: This is not – shit, Mr. Quail. It’s the
truth. I know it’s very hard for you to accept, but you’re having a
schizophrenic reaction… we can’t snap you out of the Narkadine. You’re
in a world of your own fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Then how the hell can you be in my dream – if
you know it’s just a dream?</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: I’ve been artificially implanted – like the
first part of your fantasy. I’m actually monitoring your dream at a
psychoprobe console. This is a last resort. When somebody gets stuck in
their own fantasy, we send in someone after them. A specialist, like
myself.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I don’t believe a word you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: I was afraid you’d think that. I’m sorry to
have to do this, but you really are stuck. Doctor Noel, would you come
in now please?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Yes, Mr. Quail, I’m afraid it’s all
true.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: I tried to break through to you earlier, but
you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to
get through to a client as tough as you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: So what’s supposed to happen now?</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: Just do exactly as we tell you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Somehow that doesn’t appeal to me.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Please, Mr. Quail… try to cooperate. You’re
having a schizophrenic embolism.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: If we can’t get you out now… you may never
come out of it. Your wife calls every day –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: If this is a fantasy, there’ll be no real
consequences when I pull this trigger.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: But there will by consequences inside your
mind. Consequences that won’t hurt me… but could be fatal to you. If you
shoot me, you’ll wipe me out of your fantasy – I can’t come back again.
Because to you, I’ll be dead. I can’t help you get back to reality.
You’ll be stuck in permanent psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: You’re going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail.
You’re going to hand it to me –</p>
<p><strong>edgemar</strong>: You’re going to do exactly what I tell you
–</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Watch out, Charles! There’s more of them in
the hall!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve had it, Hauser! Throw out your weapon
if you want a past!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: There’s an explosive in the clipboard! He
has a dead-man switch in his hand!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What do you say, Hauser? We haven’t got all
night! Hauser?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What happens it I come out?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ll put in a word with the big boys. Maybe
you’ll just get exile to Venus.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: All right. Here comes the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Back in, quick!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Wouldn’t you prefer your order in your room,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: In!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Okay. Answers! Now!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: They kidnapped me. Said they’d kill you if I
didn’t cooperate. I told them I didn’t care, but then when I realized
they meant it…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I don’t know why they’re after me, but what’s
your connection with all this?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: We were together before.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Believe me, I’m really sorry I can’t recall
the details of that encounter.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Go, Bennie, for God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Bad news, boss lady.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Black cruiser just pull out behind us.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Forget the shooter, boss. I lose ’em for
you.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Lose them? In this?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p>****: You’re gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie –</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Yutani 650 – you like it, boss? Nothing like
the old gas when you want a bit of speed.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: You better have two aces, Bennie. There’s a
second cruiser – and it’s gaining –</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: I take it, then, you’ve failed to get him
again.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Proceed with Operation Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: But, sir…</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: With him… …on the lose, I’m not taking any
more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Nothin’, boss. Just old smokies. Only place
they can come for a puff. It’s all banned topside.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: So you two are into something a bit more
serious than the taxi and truck-stop business.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: That’s right, boss.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: My God!… T-shirts. They died out on Earth
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Well, maybe we ain’t fashion leaders,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: No. But we still believe in a free Mars.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: So where did I fit into all this?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: You - when you were Charles Hauser with
E.I.O - infiltrated our group. I guess Cohaagen didn’t trust you any
more when you and</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yeah. And I can’t even remember it. We’ll
have to arrange a return bout.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: …so he had your memory wiped and fixed you
up with a new identity.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: But - the Sphinx. Why is that stuck in my
mind? Why’s it so important?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Just an ole heap o’ stone, boss.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: It’s more than that, Bennie, I know it’s
more. Somehow it’s connected.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Maybe there’s a way you can get your memory
back.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: How? What? Where? When?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: A bit of Martian Wisdom. We’re not all
stupid colonists.</p>
<p><strong>voice from loudspeaker</strong>: …all residents are to report
to their nearest space-travel agent within twelve hours, all residents
will be departing on shuttles within twenty-four hours. Air and water
supplies will be cut off at that time. I repeat…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: He’s doing it!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Clearing everyone out! It’s been rumored for
months…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Wow. I can see why I was willing to betray
E.I.O.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: I though you believed in our cause?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yes. Of course. That, too.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet
you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast
jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of
life.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What use is this weirdo?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Ssssh…there are skills on mars that Earth
has forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail.
Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you
are the most sought-after man on two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: This way, my dear man. We have much to
accomplish – – and very little time.</p>
<p>****: In the scenes inside Kuato’s sanctum, the loudspeaker</p>
<p><strong>voice from loudspeaker</strong>: …for information leading to
these arrests, first-class travel to Earth will be provided plus a
weekend at the Leningrad Disneyworld, all expenses paid. I repeat, an
Oriental girl and Earthman, possibly to be found in the company of a
black taxi driver. These are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of
the glorious Peoples Republic of</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: The turbulence you hear outside is but a
reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in
your search for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: And you’re going to help me by reading my
mind?</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Indubitably. There is only small matter of a
fee.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: A fee!</p>
<p><strong>kauto</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: This is for our cause!</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Income before ideals. Shall we say
five-hundred-thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars,
that’s…</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: That’s interplanetary robbery!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: With today’s exchange rate… that’s over two
million Martian dollars!</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the
future of the solar system?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Aw, come off it, man. Just for a bit of
mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball.</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Listen, buster, we’re talking heavy stuff
here. You try and work out what’s with this guy!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Okay! Okay! I’ll pay it, but the Interstellar
Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this.</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Retrieving the past is like walking backwards
along a perilous road. The half-recalled, the half-forgotten, the
repressed, the fantasies, the triumphs, joys, failures, betrayals…</p>
<p><strong>kuato</strong>: Yes… I can feel it… a wall. Erasure
techniques are so brutal. Blocks. Side channels. Future and past all
jumbled. I shall have to enter deep trance to break through. I will be
scanning you through the Oracle Head.</p>
<p><strong>oracle head</strong>: Do not fear me. I need your
openness…</p>
<p><strong>oracle head</strong>: Open you thoughts to my presence…</p>
<p><strong>oracle head</strong>: Open…</p>
<p><strong>oracle head’s voice</strong>: You have seen your past. Now
read the future…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Charles! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into
the trance! We couldn’t wake either of you!</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You stopped breathing!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Why did you kill him? It was the next bit I
really…</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: No choice, boss. It was him or you.</p>
<p><strong>oracle head</strong>: – the vengence you seek… and the
salvation of Mars… are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Phobos and Demos! What was that all
about?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Are you okay?… Charles? Doug? Whoever?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m fine… only I’m not Doug – I’m Charles
Hauser… and I know everything Hauser knew.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Bennie, where’s your depot?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Well… you go outta here… take a left, then
down past the first… no second… water bureau you…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Can you get us there?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: We’re going to the Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Impossible, man. Guards everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: The Oracle… what did you learn?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Only everything. I’ve got total recall.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: We’ll never get near the Sphinx! They’ll
blow us apart!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: What are we doing, Charles? For God’s sake,
tell us.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: The Sphinx… it’s not some useless artifact,
it’s a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago. The
same race that built the on one Earth… for the same purpose.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: This is what we need.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: It’s a hunk of old stone, man.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Purpose? What purpose?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Come on, Bennie, move it. Have you heard the
word, “terriform”?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Just deliverin’ some old junk to the mine
out at Apidalia Planitia. Got them people you’re lookin’ for in the back
as well.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight
down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts
everywhere, all powered by fusion generators…</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You sure the little man didn’t fry your
brain, Quail?</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: For what? To do what?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: To combine elements in the Martian core and
release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: That’s air!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: That’s right. Air and water. Terriforming
will create a permanent livable environment for Mars. No more
pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert. There’ll be
rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone
out?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Don’t you see?! From being a pile of red dirt
with minerals, Mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real
estate.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: And Cohaagen’s going to own it all!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Right! He can start selling it off to
well-heeled investors from Earth. Beach condos, ski resorts, you name
it.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: No wonder he wanted you to… penetrate… out
group.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Once word of this gets out, the whole planet
will support you.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: So what can we do?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead
of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: But who’ll work the machine? Do you know
how?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I’m the only one who does. Why do you think
Cohaagen’s left me alone all this time?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I was the first one inside when they cracked
the riddle of the Sphinx. It must’ve been programmed. Some kind
of…force…shot into me.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: But Cohaagen wiped your memory!!!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Just a way of putting me on ice. He’d of
reversed it once the planet was evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Man! This is real complicated. Go over it
again, real slow.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: What he hadn’t counted on was your effect on
me.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: And all without the marvels of modern
science!</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Bennie, don’t stop now, take it…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Like I said. It’s a tough planet. I’m a
baddie, not a goodie.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: I should have known, you were just too
helpful.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: EIO Rule One, man. Trust Nobody. Now you can
do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: But what about the Martian people? Out
cause? I thought you believed in it.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Your cause? That bunch of dead beat
radicals! When I hand in this little number… …I’ll get real estate
rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia…</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: This makes Bennie a cut above anyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Hope I’ve got this direction right.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: The air supply is off under the domes?</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: Yes, sir. In a couple of hours it’ll be all
gone.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Any trouble with the rabble?</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: Not much, sir. A lot of complaining. But
they’re all heading towards the shuttle areas.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: We got in with this thing, but we’ll never
get back out.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: A shame. Such a pleasant trip.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: This is the main tap – straight down to the
core of Mars. When we trigger the mechanism, fusion reactors will
detonate down there – four hundred miles deep.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Remind me not to slip.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: The new elements will come booming up through
this shaft – and six thousand others all around the planet.</p>
<p><strong>guard leader</strong>: Stay in contact. I want to hear from
this checkpoint every four minutes.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: No. Where?</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>quail’s voice</strong>: I’m not there, boys. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Watch him. He was EIO trained. They’re all
full of tricks.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Yeah? Like…who was that guy? – Fred Bond??
Keep ’em up, Fred, keep ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: A hologram!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Where’d you get that little trick?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Mail-order company. It’s a great one for
fooling the wife.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: How the hell did they get in?</p>
<p><strong>security aide</strong>: Up the fusion core.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Up the fusion core??</p>
<p><strong>security aide</strong>: They’re on Level One.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Seal all upper levels.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Know how to use one of these?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Catch!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Great stuff, but how do we get up?</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Forget them. We’ll pick up Quail once the
shuttles have left for Earth.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: If you’re afraid of the heights, you better
get over it real quick.</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: If Quail’s the only one who can operate all
this… …then he can call all the shots.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: We’ll tell him the computer’s worked out
the operational details so we don’t really need him. We’re just doing
him a favor.</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: And if that doesn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: We offer him rewards.</p>
<p><strong>emile</strong>: What if that doesn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: We’ll torture him. You don’t think I got
this far by being a nice guy?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: First of the shuttles ready for departure,
sir. Two minute countdown.</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Seal the breach! Repressurize!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Those shuttles are starting up any minute.
If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Don’t you know how?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Yes… there’s a vital connection missing…</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: …me…</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: Don’t wait!</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: If you activate the mechanism you’ll
die…there were glimpses of it in your memory.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Wrong, Cohaagen, there’s a long tunnel, a
brilliant white light, hands reaching for me…</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: That’s your death. That’s what it looks
like. That’s what is always looks like.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: space shuttles</p>
<p><strong>cohaagen</strong>: It’s not too late. Join us again. U’ve a
lot to offer. A whole world.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: You don’t deserve a new world, you and people
like you made too big a mess of the old one. Time someone else had a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>heaves beneath him … huge stone blocks crash donw
on</strong>: ALL SIDES! We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,
each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last –</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Am I dying?</p>
<p><strong>masked miner</strong>: I won’t lie to you, pal. You are.</p>
<p><strong>2nd miner</strong>: Shippin’ us all out. Mars is
finished.</p>
<p><strong>melina</strong>: It’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>miner</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: That’s just the start. Next there’ll be rain
and growth and … life.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong>: Rekall could never have come up with anything
like this.</p>
