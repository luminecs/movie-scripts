<p><strong>note</strong>: All dialogue is in French until otherwise
noted.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Turn on the flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I’m trying. It doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It has to work. You just bought it this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Do they come with batteries?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You didn’t buy batteries?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I thought they came with batteries.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I can’t believe you didn’t check.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I bought everything you put on the list.
Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Why should I have to put it on the list?
It’s like saying to buy a car with tires.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Be careful it’s…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: … hot!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Light your lighter. I can’t see anything…
and try not to burn down the house!</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I don’t know. He looks dead.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: He looked dead before he fell.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Start the car! Start the car!</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: You didn’t think to move the car before we
came out!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Raymond, get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You know what makes a good get away
driver?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You’re always pointing out my negative
qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more
productive way of relating with people.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Fine. Raymond, we’d like to commend you on
how well you fucked up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I heard you almost got your ass blown off
last night. Some thief. A regular black panther.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: A Black Panther was a member of an African
American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you’re referring
to The Pink Panther.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a
shit? And I don’t remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little
turd.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: There’s no reason to be abusive. You’re
projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: What the hell is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m talking about human beings
communicating openly and honestly.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: How about getting on your knees and
communicating with my dick?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Shut up! Both of you! You’re giving me a
fuckin’ headache.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Where’s your brother?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Vincent’s in the States on business. That
it?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Okay. Now I’ve got something I want to
–</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Do you mind? I’m trying to do some
business here.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: One more sound out of you and I’m going to
cut your fuckin’ tongue out.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You take someone in. Give them a steady
job and how do they repay you? By claiming to misplace a shipment of
your merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Maybe he did misplace it.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You misplace your car keys. You misplace
your cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Laurant, how long has he been in there?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: I don’t know. What day is today?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Is it Thursday already? This week has just
shot by.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You and your crew speak English, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak
English?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Good. I have a job for you in America.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An
acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an
assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: It seems like a long way to go for a
necklace.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Besides, we don’t know the city and–</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Mr. Bastaldi isn’t asking you if you want to
go.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Thank you Marcel, for that… extremely
redundant explanation.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: C’mon, Laurant, America?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: The job is worth about two million euros.
Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel.
You leave tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: We’re going to need to find someone who
knows the city.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I know someone.</p>
<p><strong>his pov – across the plaza</strong>: of two police officers
moving towards him . He knows he has no more time. He takes off running,
disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: All dialogue is now in English unless
otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else.
If I knew it was you I would have never run.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You’re probably here for the money I owe you.
I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You know this is how rumors get started.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Told you.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Today’s your lucky day, Sami.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Yeah, I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Normally I’d be breaking your fingers right
now, but I’m going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back
and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do
a job. You’re going with them.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: You lived there. You know the city.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’ve still got a few legal problems back in
the States.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: But I’d be… I’d be happy to go.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: If you try to leave town I’ll know. If you
manage to leave town I’ll find you… and the next time we meet in a
bathroom I’ll be cutting you up into little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Be at this address at nine o’clock tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I have
everything. Of course I’m coming back. I’m not leaving you. I’m only
going to be gone a few days. I’ll call you when I get there. Okay? I’ve
got to go now. Mama, I’ve got to go. No, I’m not yelling.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’m Sami. Marcel sent me.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What is it you do, Sami?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You know, a little of this, a little of that.
I’ve boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I’m into
pick-pocketing.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I see. A master criminal.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You
guys don’t want me, I’ll be more than happy to leave.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This is Zero.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hi. I’m one and this is two, three, four and
five.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Let me give you some advice. You don’t want
to piss him off because he’ll kill you for the fun of it. What you want
to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: So, we are going to America?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: In English. Sami doesn’t speak French.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Algeria.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: And you don’t speak French?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Well, you know, not all Algerians speak
French. It’s a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really
–</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: – Zero isn’t interested in your life story.
Who gets killed?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hopefully no one.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: No one? Then why is Zero here?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: He speaks about himself in the third
person?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Feel free to correct him if you want.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I just want you there in case there’s
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: And if there is, then Zero can kill
someone?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: I thought I would accompany you to the
airport to say bon voyage… and tell you that Marcel will be going with
you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: This is a considerable move up for you,
Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for
you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You don’t trust me?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: I don’t trust anyone. You don’t get to the
top of this game by trusting people… and after all, you are a thief.
It’s in your nature to steal. I’m just protecting my investment.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Stop it! Both of you!</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: … que je t’aime… que je…</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Are you sure you guys have the right
address? This ain’t no tourist area.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Yes. We are sure.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Let me handle this.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hey, brother. What’s happening, man?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Don’t you brother me, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What’s in the bags?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Dirty underwear.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Dirty underwear. That’s a good one. Let me
explain something to you. This is my street and you’re gonna give me
want I what or I’m gonna bust your heads open.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Lamar, violence is never an answer to
settling disputes. I can see you have a lot of anger… but this is not
the way to get it out.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Get outta my face!</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Now, are you going to give me the suitcases?
Or are we going to have to take them?</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Va te faire foutre!</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He said to go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So,
put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Who is Zero?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: He speaks about himself in the third
person?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and
take my knife from me?</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: If you insist.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Leave now before Zero shoots off those little
raisins you call balls.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought
it through customs? How stupid is that?</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in
yours.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: We are looking for Sophie. Laurant send
us.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Ouh La La.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I wasn’t expecting this many of you. I’ve
got a few sleeping bags you can use.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: This is Wayne. My roommate.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to
stay here.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite
well known in France.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yeah, I dig him.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Although a cartoon I feel he shares a
universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Whoa… That’s deep.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You guys hungry?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Could we see a wine list please?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: They don’t have a wine list.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Oh, then we will have the house wine.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sure – and would you like that before your
escargot in white truffle sauce?</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I did not order escargot.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: They don’t serve wine here.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What kind of restaurant doesn’t serve
wine?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: This kind.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Okay. I will have a beer.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I don’t think he’s grasping the concept.
Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or root beer.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: C’est quoi root beer?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He’ll have a sprite. We’ll all have
sprite.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Good. Now that we’ve gotten the beverage
selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course?</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: And no smoking.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: No smoking? No drinking? What kind of country
is this?</p>
<p><strong>close on man’s face.</strong>: VINNY, 40’s, not the brightest
bulb on the tree. His head snaps back as someone punches him in the
face. Blood flows from his nose. We are in…</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I’m sorry, Frankie. Really.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You bleed on me, I’ll kill ya.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: What’d I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What’d I
tell you when you came to me for money? Didn’t I ask you not to do it?
Did I not say that? What’d I say to him?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: You said don’t do it, boss.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: That’s right. I said don’t do it. Did you
listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now
it’s been three weeks and you ain’t paid a dime. What do you think that
makes me look like on the street? I don’t do something to you and
everyone will think they can skate.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Frankie, I –</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: – Shut up! Don’t you try to make me feel
bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn’t pay.
This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Jesus, Frankie, I’m your brother!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: That’s why we’re only breaking one arm.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: There’s an exterior alarm system. There’s
also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion
detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one
in the bedroom is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: After the outside alarm is off we go in
through the bedroom window.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the
window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in
through the front door.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What about transportation?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You can use my car.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Not a good idea. Someone gets a license
number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you’ll steal one.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: When do we go?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I know they won’t be home tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You ever hear of jet lag?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Take a nap.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Neighbors. They do this all the time.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I can’t even hear myself think.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: How are we supposed to sleep with this
noise?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’ve asked them a hundred times to keep in
down. They don’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I will talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s just a matter of communication.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting
next door and I was wondering if you could make your music a little less
loud.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: But the music is very–</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Listen asshole, I told you –</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: What’d you say to them?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Hey, Bobby beans… How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: Good. I’m doing good. How you doin’,
Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Good. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest
regards.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: When you return please extend my regards to
Mr. Maranzano and his family.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Can I offer you something. A drink?
Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso
from Sicily. Special blend. Can’t find anything like it in the
States.</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: I’m good. Really.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Okay. I understand you’re interested in one
of our properties?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant
Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The
proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the –</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: – Super what?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: Supernumerary. It means better than
expected.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Then why not just fuckin’ say better than
expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: I’m taking a vocabulary course to
enhance my communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Okay. How much?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: I’m not here to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: To tell you that we’re interested in
the property.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You told me that on the phone. What the
hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back
to your people and tell them when they’re serious to put a number on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>bobby beans</strong>: I will relay the particulars of our
conversation to Mr. Maranzano.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah – you do that.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Jerk-wad!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: How’s my brother?</p>
<p><strong>nicky “the rake”</strong>: He’s over at St. James. They had
to put two pins in his arm.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I said a clean break.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Hey boss, it’s not a science.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or
carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to
his house. I don’t want the kids to go hungry while he’s
recuperating.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You like shoes?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No, I like the bag. It would be good for the
job tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it
last time he was here. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you used it.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: So, how did you get hooked up with these
guys?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Just lucky I guess. How’d you start working
for the Bastaldi’s?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: The art world doesn’t fully appreciate my
talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay
well for information.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: So you arranged to have the people you worked
for robbed?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: They’re not nice people.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I like your tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Casandra. Old girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Did she break your heart?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It looks old. Did you get it a long time
ago?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: That’s how you get to know someone. Did it
hurt when you got it?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I don’t remember. I was drunk.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You got it in a bar?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No. I got it in prison. I went in for three
years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t mean to pry.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s okay. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’ve been thinking about getting tattoo. You
know, a flower or something. On my ass.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Who’s gonna see it there?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: The lucky ones.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Gimme the money!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Open the safe!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t have the combination.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I swear! I don’t have it!</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey, Vato, where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: My car!</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: It’s Raymond. He’s outside with the car.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: For luck.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’m glad you didn’t get something flashy.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Maybe you should call the police.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hey, idiot – I’ve got stolen wheels and a
stolen radio in the car.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I just thought that–</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: – Don’t think. Okay? You’re not good at
it.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Go do something – get some beers for the
guys.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: When I find out who did this I’m going to
mount their head on my dashboard!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: Mr. B. wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Now? I’ve got a date with a drop dead major
babe.</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: I’ll tell him that.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Okay. I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
tell her I had an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Of course, Mr. Zammito.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I think we went the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Oh, you think?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: The map said to go left.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Yeah and if you turned it around it would
say to go right.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want
something?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: No, I’m good, Angelo.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: I understand Bobby Beans came to see you
today.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about
buying the Merchant Street warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: And nothing. He’s just feeling us out.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: He’s trying to get a foot hold in our
territory.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: He sticks his toes in the water again,
we’ll cut ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Business must be good if he can afford to
buy up useless property.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I heard this quarter his profits are gonna
be supernumerary.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: They’re gonna be what?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Supernumerary. It means better than
expected.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Good word.</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to
remind you that you have an appointment in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Someone else coming?</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Nah, that’s just Tony’s way of telling me
Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Uh, no –</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: You should. You can learn a lot about the
criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay
and watch it with me.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You know, I’m kind of tired. I’m just gonna
go home if it’s all the same to you.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Go. Rest.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Oh Frankie, what’s this I hear about your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: He missed three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Your own brother? You couldn’t send someone
else to do it?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I did. Joey “Two Tons” and Nicky “The Rake”
did the deed.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: But you were there?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Angelo, we live and die by the rules we
make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a… horse-less
carriage.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: What the fuck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Park on the next street over. We’ll meet you
when we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: So much for no one being home.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: At least they got this right.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We’ve got to be careful not to use our real
names while we’re in here.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’ll be Elvis and you–</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: – I want to be Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s my idea.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: C’mon, I look more like Elvis than you
do.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Okay. You can be Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: And the rest of us are… John, Paul, George and
Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Hey, Barry Bonds. The home run king.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: It’s for my nephew.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - through the binoculars</strong>: of Zammito tied to
the chair and surrounded by the others.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Looks like Zammito’s being robbed.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Should I call C.P.D.?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Yeah, but tell them not to move until
these morons come out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Where are the jewels? There aren’t any
jewels.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: There has to be.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I’m telling you I’ve pulled out everything
in the safe. There aren’t any jewels.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: There must be half a million dollars here
though.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Marcel, we came here for jewels,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We have a problem. Problem isn’t the right
word. Dilemma. No that really doesn’t describe – Do you know who that
is?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Mr. Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No, that’s not Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It’s not?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: That’s Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the
Chicago Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a big
mistake here. May I use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Feel free.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: It’s Elvis…</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: It’s me…</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Marcel?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You’re there now?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You’re calling me on your cell phone,
right?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You’re calling me on is phone?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: My number’s going to show up on his
bill!</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Should I call you back?</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: You’ve already robbed the safe?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Take what you’ve got and get out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Walk out of here with nothing and I’ll
forget this ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Yeah. Right. You’re not a vendetta kind of
guy.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I’ll find you. No matter where you go I’ll
find you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You don’t carry the same weight in France as
you do here.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: You think it’s smart to tell him we’re
French?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I think he’s already figured that out.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: We are being watched.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Cops?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: FBI. They’ve been there for months. Think I
don’t know. Morons.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I was told to take what we have and go.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Go where? The police are outside.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: If we do this we all have to agree.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe if we did just leave
–</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: C’mon, get real, will you. You think he’s just
going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about
honor. He’s coming after us, so we might as well take the money.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You’re all dead.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Wayne, who is it?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I wasn’t expecting you guys back so fast.
How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: How’d it go? I don’t know. Daniel, how would
you say it went?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I would have to say… pretty fuckin’ bad. You
gave us the wrong address Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: That moron.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway…
Ridgeroad… Ridgeway Road.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Everyone get some sleep. We’re leaving in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: What the hell are they doing in
there?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Chicago P.D. says they can’t hold the
units here any longer. They want to know if they should go in?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Tell them no. We’ll advise if anything
changes.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Hmmm…. Oh yeah… Uh huh</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: That’s right baby, give it to papa
Joey.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons” wife</strong>: Joey, who is that?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: – And don’t call here again, you
pervert.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Yeah boss?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Boss?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Someone stole my car tonight!</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: C’mon Raphael, you don’t think that I would
steal your car?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You run a chop shop for low riders. Yes, I
think you’d steal my car.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: I swear I didn’t. I wouldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: And I should just believe–</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: – you stole my cousin Enrique’s car.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hector, don’t interrupt me.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: He told Enrique he didn’t know anything
about his car.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I don’t give a shit about your cousin’s
car. We’re here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do
that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: If I find out you’re lying. If I find out
you know anything about this I’m going to come back and cut off your
nose.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Vamos.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Sir, do you think we could have a hostage
situation in there?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Hold on a second. Joey “Two Tons” just
pulled up.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Jesus, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: They were all French guys.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: French guys? You mean like from
France?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah, French guys from France.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: What’d they take?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Boy, you must be pissed.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Well, you know, when five guys break into
my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up
and steal from me… it does irritate me.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Well, I must say you’re handling it
very well.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You know why I’m handling it very well?
Because you’re going to get these guys for me.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Okay boss. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: If I knew where they were you wouldn’t have
to find them, would you?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: You didn’t say find them. You said,
“get them.”</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Just find them!</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Okay boss.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Papa Joey?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Can’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’m sorry things went so wrong today.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I thought I’d listen to some of the tapes. See
what’s so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Sounds boring.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s three in the morning. Not much else to
do.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I can think of something.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: She’s not here, man.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I think she went to do some laundry. Threw
some stuff in a bag and left.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Bag?</p>
<p><strong>close on daniel</strong>: Asleep. Sami shakes him. He opens
his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Get up. We’ve been ripped off!</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Oh, man… this is bullshit! You can’t trust
anyone these days.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: She took everything! Didn’t even leave us
cab fare.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Not everything.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I was going to listen to it last night but I
–</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: – feel asleep.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No you didn’t, dude. You were bangin’ Sophie.
I saw you guys going at it.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You slept with her?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Well, actually I would say she slept with
me.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What’s the big deal? It’s not like I was on
guard duty or something.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You didn’t think it was little suspicious
that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No. Chicks dig me.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: It’s me. I need an answer from you
if I’m going to move.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: We’re not just talkin’ about a ‘piece
of work’ here. We’re talking about a boss.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: Bonanno’s a dinosaur. Guy thinks
he’s fuckin’ Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we
don’t change now we’re going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can
count on your support?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No wonder Zammito didn’t want us to walk out
with this stuff. He’s planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the
family.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: This wasn’t the deal! The deal was to steal
a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it
is.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You know, if you could get your nose out of
Bastaldi’s ass for two seconds you might see what’s going on around
you.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last
night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little
voice in my head saying, “don’t do it! Don’t you do it!” Jesus, why
don’t I ever listen to myself?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Yeah, but you did do it. So let’s deal with
that.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: What are you guys so scared of? Zammito
doesn’t know who we are. We just get out of town and it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Oh, you think it’s that easy?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yeah. We just go home.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the
airport and get on a plane.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: They’ll be waiting for us at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You steal some money from a man he gets over
it in time. But these tapes. He’s never going to stop looking for
us.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We have to find Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: How are we going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I know where she went.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I heard her talking on the phone. Bay View
Motel. It’s about five blocks from here.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Tell me the truth Hector… do you think
we’ll find my car?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: How do we know what room she’s in?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hi. Did a woman just check in? She’s about
five six. Pretty. Dark hair.</p>
<p><strong>motel clerk</strong>: I can’t give out information on our
guests.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: C’mon man, I think she’s having an affair.</p>
<p><strong>motel clerk</strong>: So are half the people in this place. I
can’t help you, pal.</p>
<p><strong>motel clerk</strong>: Look, I can’t tell you –</p>
<p><strong>motel clerk</strong>: Room fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I really thought we had something special
going. I can’t tell you what a disappointment you’ve turned out to
be.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: After last night I could say the same for
you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The money isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Where is it, Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: If you think because you’re a women this
can’t go hard on you, think again.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Who are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Stick around and find out.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: He’s FBI.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What is she doing with an agent du FBI?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We’ve been set up.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We didn’t go to the wrong house. We went to
right one, didn’t we Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: They send us to Zammito’s house. The FBI is
right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don’t move. A
crime is going down and they don’t move. Why? Because they were waiting
for us to come out so they could arrest us.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: What does arresting us get them?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You wanna tell him?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You’re telling it fine.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You see my friend over there? I nod to him
and he’s going to put a bullet in your knee.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: That’s going to make a lot of noise.
Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: He’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Okay! Okay! We’ve been investigating
Zammito for years, but we’ve never had enough evidence for a warrant to
search his house. We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning
on taking Bonanno out.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We know all this.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You just don’t take out a boss. You
need permission from the other families to do something like that. Our
informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and
recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren’t
involved. Look at these tapes. The guy has recorded every conversation
he’s had for years.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we
come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use
against him.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What are you getting out of this?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Money. It was supposed to simple. In and
out.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
will you explain to her I had an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Of course, Mr. Zammito.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hi. I’m meeting Frankie Zammito –</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Laurant and Vincent were in business with
Zammito.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What kind of business?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Black market art. Zammito got to a few key
security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi’s supplied the
artists to make copies of famous works. They’d switch the paintings,
send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi’s would sell them to
private collectors.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: We’re talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.
We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh’s “Vase with twelve sunflowers”
last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery
and they’re not going to be very happy when they find out about it.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to
trade up for his brother?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Yeah. He delivers the goods on
Zammito. If we got what we wanted we’d let his brother go providing he
tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No one has mentioned the part of the plan
about us getting caught and going to prison.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’re leaving. Raymond get the bag.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You walk out with that bag and you
won’t only have Zammito and his people after you. You’ll have the entire
United States justice department. How far do you think you’ll get? I
know who you are Mr. Foray? Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet. Mr…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Zero. That’s all I know.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You’ll never get out of the city.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Bastaldi’s dead. He is fuckin’ dead!</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: You want Zero to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’m going to kill him myself!</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: What about the money?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It has to be at Sophie’s. She didn’t have time
to go anywhere else before she came here.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: We don’t know that for sure.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Forget the money! We’ve got bigger problems
than the money right now.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: She probably hid it at her place. The six
of us could find it in –</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: – We don’t have time to look for it. Hadley’s
first move is going to be to look for us there.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’re moving. Pack up and be on the street
in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: This is turning to shit. If word gets
out of my involvement in this I’ll go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Listen, we know their names. They don’t know
the city. You’ll find them. You’re the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I can’t bring the Bureau into this. If
I do the tapes become evidence.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: They’re supposed to be evidence. That’s why
Bastaldi set this up.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These
tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them
back?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I thought you wanted Zammito?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: What for? The minute I get him some
other Gavone will take his place. I’ve been doing this for twenty years.
When I retire it’s not going to be to some trailer park in the
suburbs.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Too many people know about my
involvement in this.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Then we just have to make sure everyone who
knows can’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You’re right about that.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I would like to thank you for your
hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What do you want now?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Guns. Can you get them?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Man, I can get anything.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Don’t bullshit me.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I ain’t bullshittin’. I can get guns. I can
get any kind of gun you want. But they ain’t gonna help your sorry ass.
You ain’t been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest
people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ve got a way with people.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I can see that. The man’s car you stole.
Raphael Ruiz. He’s head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy
motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito’s got the word out he’s looking for
some French dudes. You’re French ain’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’m from Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Yeah, I’d be from Belgium too if I was you.
You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm
cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of
people who are lookin’ for you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Why haven’t you turned us in?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I ain’t no rat. You got money, right?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: And, uh, I’m going to have to charge you a
commission… kind of like a brokerage fee.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: A thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Take this. I’ll call you in a few hours. You
tell me where we meet.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Hey dude, what do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Uh… excuse me, but don’t you need a warrant
or something?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Not today. Where are your friends?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: They left about a half hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Hey man, you can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: What? This?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Or this?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I’m your worst fuckin’ nightmare. Now,
if you don’t want me to keep on hurting you, it’s important that I
believe you and right now I don’t. So tell me, where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I swear man, I don’t know. They packed up and
left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Maid service.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I know Mama, but I couldn’t call you
yesterday we were very busy. No, nothing’s more important than you. I
don’t know. I think I’m going to have to stay a few more days.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Did you know about Bastaldi’s deal with
Zammito?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I think if he told me he was going to steal
Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers in a vase” I would remember it.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: “Vase with twelve Sunflowers.”</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Whatever! He never told me about the Van
Gogh or any of the other paintings.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he
would come along if he knew we were being set up?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I think he’d cut his dick off if Bastaldi
told him to.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Fuck you! You know I’d never go along with
something like this.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: This ain’t about that and you know it. This
is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You guys used to work together?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Yeah and he can’t stand it that I tried to
do something to better myself.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You call being Bastaldi’s lap dog
better?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Better than spending my life crawling
through windows in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: All right, knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: All you are is a professional
ass-kisser.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m not a guy who is known for his patience
and right now you’re testing mine.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What is that a threat? Are you fuckin’
threatening me, Marcel?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I said knock it off! Now as far as I’m
concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is
over, but right now we’ve got to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s simple. Bastaldi’s moving up. He’s
closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all
of us.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Well, I say the whole deal is off. In fact,
if you ask me, there never was a deal because we were screwed from the
start.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Hey Sami, you’re on TV.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … Sami Zerhouni in connection with the
murder of Sophie Nichols.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Police have confirmed that Zerhouni was
seen entering the woman’s room by the Motel Manager.</p>
<p><strong>close on television</strong>: The Reporter continues her
story.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Zerhouni is also wanted by police for
questioning regarding a robbery last night at the home of alleged Mafia
member Frankie Zammito.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>close on television</strong>: The Reporter continues.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The other members of his gang are reported
to be French nationals Daniel Foray, Marcel Burot, Julien Labesse…</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Dumb crackers –</p>
<p><strong>close on television</strong>: The reporter finishes her
story.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … Raymond Gayet and an unidentified man
only known as Zero.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: That should shake things up.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Up next. A vacation get away on a budget
–</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hadley –</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Has to be.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: This is bad. This is really fuckin’ bad. Am
I the only one who sees how bad this is?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hey, it’s not your picture on the TV, it’s
mine. So, try to be cool.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Don’t tell me to be cool! We were supposed
to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we’ve
managed to get the Mafia… the FBI… the Chicago Police Department and a
group of Latin gang members after us. I haven’t left out anyone, have I?
I don’t think so, because we’ve already pissed off everyone in the
fuckin’ city!</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: We’ve got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: That’s brilliant! Care to elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You’re not helping.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Julien, what you’re doing right now is a
very normal psychological reaction to stress. You’re projecting your
anger onto us.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Oh, Jesus. We’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just
watching the news and–</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: – Did you set it up?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o’clock.
Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent
notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I’m going to have to increase
my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We had a deal.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: We had a deal before you and your friends
became the new poster boys for crime.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Fine. Ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from
someone who looks like one of us.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We need to rent a car and for that you need
a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why not just steal another one?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Too risky. We don’t need to get pulled over
because of a stolen car.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Maybe I’m missing the obvious, but why
aren’t we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than
Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It doesn’t matter where we go. Between Zammito
and the FBI they’ll find us. We have to end this here.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: And how do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: That’s an excellent plan. Very
comforting.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me about this?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You
don’t need my problems.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: We’re family. An insult to you is an insult
to me.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: They knew who you were when they broke in
your house?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: What is happening with the world? There was
a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world
thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can
replace, but there’s a cardboard box… photos of my mother. They’re the
only ones I have of her.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: We’re doing everything we can to find these
people. Right Tony?</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: We’ve reached out to everyone we
know.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: If they’re still stupid enough to be in
this city, Tony will find them.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Frankie, come here a second.</p>
<p><strong>nicky “the rake”</strong>: Who is closer to the wall, Joey or
me?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>nicky “the rake”</strong>: Just tell me who’s closer to the
wall?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You are! Now get in the fuckin’ car!</p>
<p><strong>black guy</strong>: I’m gonna have to search you.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’ll save you the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>black guy</strong>: You can’t come in here with that.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What’s wrong with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: He’s my cousin. He’s deaf.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’re here to buy, not steal. If you guys
are straight there’s not going to be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: Let them in.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: What can I do you for?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How much for the nines?</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: A grand a piece.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ll need extra clips and ammo.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What the hell you doing, Ellwood? I gave them
my word.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: Zammito’s offering twenty grand a head for
these guys. You think I’m going to settle for four G’s when I can make
forty? All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: I said put it on the floor, not kick it
under the bed.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: Get that and add it to my inventory.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: I assume you’re carrying too?</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: Okay, put it on the floor… and do not kick
it under the fuckin’ bed.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy, if
you’re thinking about makin’ a move, don’t. Nobody is that fast.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Zero is.</p>
<p><strong>ellwood</strong>: Who’s Zero?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>black guy</strong>: Found it!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: There’s ten grand in here. It’s yours. I’m
going to call you again. There’s one more thing I need you to do.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ll tell you when it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I am not comfortable with this. I’m not a
good liar.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Relax. It will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>car rental agent</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton,
Ohio and I would like to rent a car with my visa gold card.</p>
<p><strong>car rental agent</strong>: I got a couple French guys here
trying to rent a car. Sure. I can stall them.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Angie, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Hey, you’re looking good. There’s something
different about you. You get a boob job or something?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I’ve gained weight.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah, well, it suits you.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Hey Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I’m Richie. He’s Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Angie, take the kids down to the gift shop
and buy ’em something. I need a word with Vinny.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we buy?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: She seems pleasant enough.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: She doesn’t know. She thinks I fell down the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: That’s good. That’s what a stand-up guy
does.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: So, I just come by to see how you’re
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You broke my arm. How the hell do you think
I’m doin’?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating
you all right? Food okay?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Yeah. I’m going home today. What do you want,
Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I don’t want anything.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: A little?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and… well
I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So,
I’ve decided to make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You gonna forget about the money I owe
you?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was
thinking I’d throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down
to the club, make espresso for the boys… wash their cars… run some
errands… things like that.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah? I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I got something I gotta do. I’m glad we had
this talk. Heal. Get better. Let me know when you’re ready to start.</p>
<p><strong>gang member</strong>: I ain’t seen it your car. Sorry man.
Hey, you know who you should talk to is Freddy O.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I thought he was in prison.</p>
<p><strong>gang member</strong>: Got out last month. He’s trying to go
straight but he’s still wired in.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Agent Hadley.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Do you know who this is?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Yeah. I figured I’d be hearing from
you.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me
in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.</p>
<p><strong>car rental agent</strong>: I’m sorry about the wait. There
was a problem with the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Everything okay now?</p>
<p><strong>car rental agent</strong>: Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I don’t know the little one, but the other
guy is definitely one of them. Follow them and call me when you find out
where they go.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m the driver.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: I’ve never driven a Cadillac before.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: This is a car. I think this is the best
American car I’ve ever driven.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: This is the only American car you’ve ever
driven.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You set me up, you piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You think I’m going to talk to you
until I know if you’re wired.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Wired? I ain’t wired.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Okay. Okay. I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You killed her!</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: No. You killed her. Manager remembers
you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with
you.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You’re fucked, Sami. You know it.
That’s why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I
don’t know these guys. A few days ago I’m in Paris picking pockets and
now I’m America’s most wanted.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Where are the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I can get them – but what do I get if I
do?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: A pass.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A
witness can put me at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Witness’ can be convinced they made a
mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won’t have enough to
prosecute you.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: They don’t have a murder weapon?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: No. I have it. The lamp? The one with
your fingerprints and her blood on it? Remember?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Of course they could always get an
anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster behind the motel.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You want the tapes for yourself. You’re going
to sell them.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I’m going to retire with a shit-load
of money. Find me a small country that doesn’t have an extradition
treaty with the States and live the good life.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You didn’t have to kill Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What about me? Aren’t I a loose end?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: When this is over you can say whatever
the hell you want. I’ll be long gone. Besides, who’s going to believe
you? You’re just a two-bit crook.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: And you’re a dirty cop. At least I don’t
pretend to be something different than what I am.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: When you’ve got the tapes call me on
this number. We’ll make the exchange and that’ll be the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>his pov - in the mirror</strong>: of the Lincoln several cars
back. Julien seems concerned. He turns the steering wheel hard to the
right.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: We’re being followed.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I knew I should have driven.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Stop talking. I’m trying to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What are we going to –</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: When we get to the next corner jump out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m not going to leave you.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: We both know I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. raymond of the towncar – day</strong>: The driver is
reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and is just about to
shoot when…</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. a large truck – day</strong>: Speeds through the
intersection and smashes head on into the Lincoln. It crumbles like a
toy under the weight.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Julien?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s not your fault, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We had a chance to walk out of Zammito’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: We all agreed to it. You had no way of
knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I just want to live long enough to get back
to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I say we make him pay first. After that you
can do whatever you want to him.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: He’s right. Do you have any idea what Van
Gogh’s “Vase with twelve Sunflowers” is worth?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: No. How much?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t know. It’s gotta be millions.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We still have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Maybe if we gave the tapes back –</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: They killed our friend. It’s personal now.
Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the
key.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: He’s right. The tapes give us leverage with
Bastaldi.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Hello? Mrs. Gayet? Do you speak
English? You do. Great. Oh, you taught Raymond English. You did a
wonderful job. I’m sorry to call so late but I’m supposed to meet
Raymond – No, I didn’t know he was a difficult child. Mrs. Gayet, I’m
calling because – No, I don’t have any children of my own. I’m supposed
to meet Raymond tonight at his hotel and I forgot what Hotel he is at. I
wondering if you – The Holiday Hotel. Room 912. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: What’d you guys find?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln
are your… associates.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: And the other car?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Some French guy. At least that’s what
his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn’t be talking to you about
this.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Are you forgetting who supplements
your income?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: No. It’s just that the French guy had
a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys
involved in this?</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Yeah. I’ll come down and make a
full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some
cash.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: What hotel?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: The Holiday Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: What room number?</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: I don’t know. I didn’t look.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Go look.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station
are out. We know they’re connected to the car rental agencies because
that’s where they picked up Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Even if we get out of town and go to another
airport I’m sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: How about Canada?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What are we going to do, take a taxi?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’m going to get some cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>freddy o</strong>: I can’t believe someone would have the
balls to rip off your ride.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: When I find them they won’t have them for
much longer.</p>
<p><strong>freddy o</strong>: I’ll ask around. If they try to move it I
can find out.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I’d like to see the manager
please.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I’m looking for several French men who
checked in within the last twenty four hours.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: They checked in last night.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I need you to take me to their
room.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me. I was here first.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey buddy, you just can’t push in here.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I most certainly will not go–</p>
<p><strong>operator’s voice</strong>: Operator.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Room 912.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Get that, will you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why do I always have to answer the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Because you’re the closest.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m not any closer than you are.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Why is everything an argument with you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m just setting my boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Get out of the room! You’ve got company coming
up. I’ll meet you at the Chevy.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Raymond, grab the tapes. We’re leaving!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why do I have to pick up the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You should go now.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: C’mon, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: on the gun as it flies through the
air.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: One of the WISEGUYS has almost circle
around the car.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: on the gun has it flies through the
air.</p>
<p><strong>real time – on marcel</strong>: He looks to his left just as
the gun arrives. It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: The bullet went clean through.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I can’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: So, can I have your fries?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: When we get back to Paris I’ll take you
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Bring me the scissors.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: And the Vodka.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: And be careful when you get near the top. Zero
has a very long one.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What’s he joking around for? He’s been
shot.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He’s been shot a lot. He’s used to it.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Anybody hungry?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Some bread and…</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Cheese? In a can?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: God, I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hey, you know you can’t this in France.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nicky “the rake”</strong>: They sort of got away.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: I see. Well, get back out on the street and
find them before I “sort of” kill you.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: But we ain’t had nothing to eat all
day boss.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Try to get this through that fat, stupid
fuckin’ head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do
and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Cafones!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: You gonna bring that over here today, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The new Beaujolais’ come out in France next
week. You like wine?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I’m more of a whiskey drinker myself.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Glenmorangie.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Glenmorangie is very good.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: But I’ll have a glass of Beaujolais with you
when we get back.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ll be back in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Can I trust you, Sami?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Hey, who warned you that they were coming up
to the room?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: If they had taken us by surprise they would
have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No, that would have left me with nothing
because all of you would be dead.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You haven’t answered my question.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Does it really matter what I say?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’m leaving you with my friends. I’m
trusting you to do the right thing today.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You better.</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Tell him I’m the guy who robbed Frankie
Zammito.</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Either you are incredibly brave, or
incredibly stupid. Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I guess we’re going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: You rob an associate of mine… a friend
and–</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Not such a good friend. May I reach in my
pocket?</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: He’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: Of course. I need an answer from
you if I’m going to move.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: We’re not just talkin’ about a ‘piece
of work’ here Frankie. We’re talking about a boss.</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: Bonanno’s a dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ve got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This
guy’s an idiot. How he’s lived this long is a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: I don’t think it will be a mystery much
longer.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He’s recorded every conversation he’s had
with you for years.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: I assume you want something?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We’ve got a lot of people looking for us.
We’d just like to go home.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: You want me to help you get out of the
country?</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: And for my help I would get what?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Half the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: And the other half?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’ll destroy them when we get back to
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: I only have your word for that.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I just want to get my people home. I know
who you are and what you could do to me if I don’t honor my word.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: Where are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: I only ask so I can call you when the
arrangements are made.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: How about if I call you?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Same place. One hour.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: What the fuck was all that about at the hotel
last night? I thought we had a deal?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Hey, you’re not exactly the most
trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn’t work. Did you
bring the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: The lamp?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Just a second. You must think I’m a
real moron.</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: I just came by to tell that “piece
of work” you asked for on Johnny Wicks – It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno’s voice</strong>: Good. How’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: Like the crying rat bastard that he
was.</p>
<p><strong>zammito’s voice</strong>: Angelo, we can’t lean too hard on
this guy. He’s a congressman.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno’s voice</strong>: I made Peter Dimiano a congressman.
We pay him each month to look after our interests.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Here you go, sport.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I’ll take the bag.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You don’t think I see through this?
You tell Sami he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: You’re making a big mistake. I’m an
FBI agent.</p>
<p><strong>lamar’s buddies</strong>: C’mon, man! Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>on hadley</strong>: He can’t believe his luck. He runs over,
picks up the loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: he peers out from behind the fountain,
watching as Hadley walks off in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: See, I told you that you could trust me.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Okay, we’re square now, right?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: There’s just one more thing I need you to
do.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Mr. Bonanno, I was wondering if you– That
would be fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: This came for you.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Since we’re such good pals I thought I’d sneak
you an advanced copy of my latest work. I call it, “I am a scum-sucking
FBI agent”.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You want the tapes for yourself. You’re going
to sell them.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I’m going to retire with a shit-load
of money. Find me a small country that doesn’t have an extradition
treaty with the States and live the good life.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: You didn’t have to kill Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: It’s a little arty I know, but it has great
content, don’t you think? You were so busy looking for a wire you
probably didn’t even think about a video camera. It was on the statue.
Anyway, I’ve sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the
FBI. They’ll get it tomorrow. If I were you I’d take the day off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey boss, some guy named Hadley. Says he’s
got some tapes you want?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah? How much? Are you nuts? Okay. Okay.
There’s an old warehouse on Merchant Street…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Mr. Zammito?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I represent a person who wishes to remain
anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I understand. The person who sent me wishes
to help you.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You see that car?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s yours. A gift. A gift you could give
to your brother… or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The papers for the car will arrive
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Those the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Watch the paint.</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: The money?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: How’d you get these?</p>
<p><strong>agent hadley</strong>: I got ’em. That’s all you need to
know.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>wayne newton’s voice</strong>: Danke Schoen, darling Danke
Schoen. Thank you for all the joy and pain…</p>
<p><strong>wayne newton’s voice</strong>: Pictures show, second balcony,
was the place we’d meet…</p>
<p><strong>wayne newton’s voice</strong>: … second seat, go Dutch treat,
you were so sweet…</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Can you believe that guy? What a moron.</p>
<p><strong>joey “two tons”</strong>: Good song though.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Great fuckin’ song.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: This plane will take you to Canada. From
there you can fly back to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: You have something for me?</p>
<p><strong>half tooth tony</strong>: They’re good, boss.</p>
<p><strong>bonanno</strong>: And the other half of the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You have my word. I’ll destroy them.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: A car.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a
sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: For me? What am I going to do with a piece
of shit like this?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I don’t know. Sell it. It’s gotta be worth
something. Someone gave it to me. C’mon Frankie, I’m trying to make good
here.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I’ll get you the papers tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Hey, if you’re well enough to be walking
around you’re well enough to start working here.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You lost?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Don’t come off like a hard-on with me. I’m
about to make you a very happy man.</p>
<p><strong>a series of quick cuts</strong>: Music continues as several
gang members check their guns.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Anybody know about that car outside?</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Yeah. It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: No. It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: The hell it is.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I’m telling you that’s my car! And
someone’s gonna pay for it!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: And I’m tellin’ you it ain’t! Now, turn
your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Fuck you, grease-ball!</p>
<p><strong>zammito</strong>: Fuck me? Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>series of quick cuts</strong>: – Raphael’s eyes burn into
Zammito’s – A Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side. – A Wiseguy
bites his lip. – Nicky “The Rake” twitches his fingers nervously. –
Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey “Two Tons”.</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: My love, forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: I didn’t mean to have it end
like this…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: I didn’t mean to have you fall
in love, in love with me…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: My love, please kiss me…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: Arrivederci amore kiss me…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: Remember when we part…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: You’ll have my heart…</p>
<p><strong>jerry vale’s voice</strong>: I love you so…</p>
<p><strong>a different angle</strong>: We can see the five of them
crouched behind a parked car. Marcel peers through the window at
Bastaldi who is still trying to figure out where they went. They are all
amused with Bastaldi’s bewilderment.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: He’s looking around for us.</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: Zero can’t stay like this much longer. His leg
is hurting.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It’s Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Daniel. Listen I’m afraid there has been a
big–</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: – I’ve got the tapes. If you ever want to
see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million
euros to your boat at six o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: A million! I don’t have that kind of
money.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Don’t bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the
Van Gogh.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: I don’t have it. That’s why Vincent went
to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Well, you better get the money somehow. Six
o’clock and come alone. If you don’t we’ll destroy the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Go back on deck. There’s a small rowboat in
the water –</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Put the money in the rowboat and untie it.
The current will carry it down river. When we see that the money is
there I’ll call back and tell you where the tapes are.</p>
<p><strong>daniel’s pov</strong>: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the
suitcase in the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the
current.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Go down into the main cabin. The tapes are
in the wooden chest.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This is for Julien.</p>
<p><strong>bastaldi</strong>: Oh, Merde!</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Did you have to use that much explosive?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I promised Bonanno I’d destroy the
tapes.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: You didn’t check it?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m sorry! I was caught up in the excitement
of the moment. I should have checked. I made a mistake. I suppose that
none of you have ever made a mistake before?</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: This is great. After everything we’ve been
through we’ve got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: The baseball is mine.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No! You can’t have the baseball! You’re not
entitled to the fuckin’ baseball!</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m the one who took it. It’s my
baseball!</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: If you say baseball one more time Zero will
shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Raymond, don’t you think they’re over
reacting a little?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. I think they have a right to express
their anger with you in light of the fact that you’re…</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry…
but I’m the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Give it to me, Sami.</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sami</strong>: Perfect.</p>
