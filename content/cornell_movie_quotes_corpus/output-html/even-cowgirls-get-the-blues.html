<h1 id="even-cowgirls-get-the-blues">even-cowgirls-get-the-blues</h1>
<p><strong>the chart keeper</strong>: She is restless tonight.</p>
<p><strong>another indian</strong>: She dreams of loving.</p>
<p><strong>still another</strong>: She has the blues.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Well, you’re lucky that you don’t suck
’em.</p>
<p><strong>daddy</strong>: Sissy couldn’t suck ’em, she’d need a mouth
like a fish tank.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: The poor little tyke might have a hard time
finding herself a hubby. But as far as getting along in the world, it’s
a real blessing that Sissy’s a girl-child. Lord, I reckon this youngun
would never make a mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>daddy</strong>: Nope, and not a brain surgeon, neither.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Course she’d do pretty good as a butcher. She
could retire in two years on the overcharges alone.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: One thing, that youngun would make one hell
of a hitchhiker…</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: …if she was a boy, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: She is, if I may speak frankly,
somewhat of a medical oddity. Due to impaired dexterity, her life
activities and career potentialities will be reduced. It could be worse.
Bring her back to me if there ever is pain. Meanwhile, she will have to
learn to live with them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hankshaw</strong>: That she will. That she will. The
Lord made them things big for a purpose. God don’t never git tired of
testing our kind. It’s a punishment of some sort, for what I don’t
rightly know. Oh Doc, if a young man ever shows up here with, a young
man with ugly fingers, you know, something similar, a similar case, Doc,
would you please…</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: Remember the words of the painter Paul
Gauguin, dear lady. “The ugly may be beautiful, the pretty never.” I
don’t suppose that means very much to you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hankshaw</strong>: It’s a judgement. She’s gotta bear
the punishment.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: I am the enlightened Madame Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: There is nothing about your past,
present or future that your hands do not know, and there is nothing
about your hands that Madame Zoe does not know. There is no hocus-pocus
involved. I am a scientist, not a magician. I, Madame Zoe, chiromancer,
lifelong student of the moldings and markings of the human hand. I,
Madame Zoe, to whom no facet of your character or destiny is not readily
revealed. I am prepared to…</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ!</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: You have a strong will. Will power and
determination are indicated by the first phalanx. The second phalanx
indicates reason and logic. You obviously have both in large supply.
What’s your name, dearie?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Sissy.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Hmmm. I’d say that you have an
intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic nature. However, Sissy, however,
there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx- the phalanx of logic –
that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior, a refusal to
accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be
disrespectful of those who do. Your mama tells me that you’re pretty
well behaved and shy, but I’d watch out for signs of irrationality. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: I guess the most important aspect of
your thumbs is the, ahem, over all size. Uh, what was it, do you know,
that caused…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs hankshaw</strong>: Don’t know; the doctors don’t
know…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Just lucky I guess.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Do you study history in school? Galileo,
Descartes, Newton? Lebinitz had very large thumbs; Voltaire’s were
enormous, but, heh heh, just pickles compared with yours.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What about Crazy Horse?</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Crazy Horse? You mean the Indian? Nobody
that I’ve ever heard of ever troubled to study the paws of savages.
Well, I guess that about covers the three-fifty charge…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hankshaw</strong>: Husband.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hankshaw</strong>: Husband. Will she find a husband?</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: I see men in your life, honey. I also
see women, lots of women.</p>
<p><strong>madame zoe</strong>: A husband, no doubt about it, though he
is years away. There are children, too. Five, maybe six, but the husband
is not the father. They will inherit your characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: I’ve traveled through the Yucatan with a
circus, popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip.
When I ate peyote one night and had a vision. Niwet�kame, the Mother
Goddess, came to me on the back of a doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears
she was shedding, crying ‘Delores, you must lead my daughters against
their natural enemy. You must come to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare
for your mission, the details of which will be revealed to you in a
third vision….’ That night I whipped the shit out of my black lover and
ran away. For a while I drove around, making a living selling peyote
buttons to hippies, until I made my way here…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Going north?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You bet your raggedy white ass I am.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: American Cheese. The king of road food.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are you in show business?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I was a successful model once.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: For magazines?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl
from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So now you’re bummin’ around?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hitchhiking?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’m the best.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re the best?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred
and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed
the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and
caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Whooee!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: As I developed, however, I grew more
concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H.
no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to
geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping
car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately
that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass,
then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: I will send this out to Sissy, she
should get it in a week, and you will be able to meet her. When I send a
letter to Sissy, duplicates must be sent to U.S. Post Office Boxes in
LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge, Cherokee and that other place, for her to
pick up… Why she’s probably out there right now in Hibbing, Minnesota,
or Deluth, Montana… hitching her way across the country.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Right off, I don’t remember how old I was
when I found out I was part Indian. My mamma’s family, a lot of them,
had lived out West, in the Dakotas, and one of them had married a squaw.
Siwash tribe. My pleasure in Indianhood and my passion for car travel
might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive…….. After all, the first
car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief
of the Ottawa: Pontiac……</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: NEW YORK CITY. It’s still a helluva
town….</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Sit down dear, do sit down.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Take a load off those lovely tootsies.
Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy some sherry?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Shit O goodness, I’m all out of
sherry; how about some Red Ripple?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: You know what Red Ripple is don’t you?
It’s Kool-Aid with a hard on. Tee Hee.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And
welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake
City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first,
tell me about yourself. It’s been six months, hasn’t it? In some circles
that’s half a year. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Tired…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: That’s the very first time in the eons
that I’ve known you that I’ve ever heard you complain. And now you’re
tired, poor darling.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: A born freak can only go uphill.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks
in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a
white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you’ll see what I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’ve always been proud of the way nature
singled me out. It’s the people who have been deformed by society I feel
sorry for. I’ve been steady moving for eleven years and some months.
Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I’m not as young as I used to
be.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Shit O goodness, you won’t be thirty
for another year, and you’re more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Does that mean you might have an assignment
for me?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let’s
see, from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You’ve always
smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me.
You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn’t need Dew. I loath
the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they
start fooling around with men and soon they’re stinking. Like rotten
mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna
fish’s retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to
Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Bonanza Jellybean?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: She’s a young thing who works on my
ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She’s
cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one’s
name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Your ranch?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Oh my dear yes, I bought a little
ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have
cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal
products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off,
actually.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can
desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has
arranged a job for you. And what a job…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: A job for me?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: I am once more about to make
advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could
possibly assist me.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: The Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as
blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported
reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from
the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label
warnings.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Shit O dear, that’s enough to make me
asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female
odor? Don’t interrupt. Here’s my concept. My ranch out West? It’s a
beauty ranch. Oh, it’s got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax
purposes. But it’s a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women –
divorcees and widows, mainly – can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles,
change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next
disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose
douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most
popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It’s on the migratory
flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping
cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond
– Siwash Lake, it’s called – twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend
a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes
do. I’ve never seen them, understand, but I hear they’re magnificent.
Very big specimens – I mean, huge mothers – and white as snow, to coin a
phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and
bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn’t know it, are
noted for their mating dance. It’s just the wildest show in nature. It’s
probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old
maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full
dance – leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping
their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it’s overwhelming. And
picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home
screen, creation’s most elaborate sex ritual – yet clean and pure enough
to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a
white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in
black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she
dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum.
And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A
sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love.
Are you starting to get it? Doesn’t it make the hair on your neck stand
up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic
and Girl Scout- oriented; you can’t top it. I’ve hired a crew of experts
from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around.
You’re my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn’t be better,
not even if she had your personality which she doesn’t; Anyway, dear,
I’m out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous
conversation is! We’re back at the beginning. The exact man I’ve wanted
you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: If you don’t want me to pose for him, why do
you want me to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Purely personal. I believe you might
enjoy one another.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: But Countess…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Now, now. Don’t get exasperated. I
realize that you’ve always avoided all but the most rudimentary
involvements with men, and I might add, you’ve been wise. Heterosexual
relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a
matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV,
pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he
doesn’t have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too
much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is
what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: But here you are, still a virgin – you
are virginal yet, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I
came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Yes, well, what I’m getting at is that
there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to
lose her virginity. She can’t wait too long, you know. Now, there’s no
reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What makes you think this watercolorist and I
would develop a romantic relationship?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: I can’t be certain that you would. But
what have you got to lose?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Well, okay. I’ll try it. I don’t see the
point in it, but I’ll try it. Just for you. It’s kind of silly,
actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Good, good, good… you’ll enjoy it,
you’ll see. Julian is a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: By the way, Sissy… he’s a full blooded
Indian.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Well, I’m not scared of a little rain.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Might as well brave it.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: Right. I don’t know about you but I’m sure
not sweet enough to melt.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Someday…… if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows
up here, I’m gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken. Chickens are
the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize. If you can look a chicken in
the eyes for tens seconds, it’s yours forever.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want to complain that some of the cowgirls
have been sleeping two to a bunk again, in violation of the agreement
that “crimes against nature” are to be confined to the hayloft.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t care who lay with whom or where or
how, but the moaners, groaners and screamers ought to turn down their
volume when others are trying to sleep or meditate.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: I want to complain about the food around
here! It’s rotten to the core.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: My sacred crocodile! She’s flipped.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I move that the meeting be adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: At the end of the endless game, there is
friendship.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What the heck did she mean by that!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Just that in Heaven all business is conducted
this way.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: We’d better take you home.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I beg your pardon. I’ve been enthralled with
your photographs for years. When the Countess hinted that you might like
to meet me – he never explained why – I was ready to paint for him free
of charge. And now I had to go and spoil it.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: This is dreadful. You know, asthma attacks
are brought on by emotional stress. Poor Julian is so high strung. The
excitement of meeting you – my dear, you look so stunning! – must have
upset his chemical balance.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: Come on, Sissy, don’t be afraid of us.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’ve never ridden in a cab. The whole idea of
paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It’ll be all right, dear. It isn’t as serious
as it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: There, that ought to beat them bronchial
buggers into submission.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: I was a medic in the Army. I really should
have become a doctor. Sometimes, though, I feel that pushing books is a
whole lot like pushing medicine. Think of books as pills. I have pills
that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom. I have pills to elevate
moods and pills to open people’s eyes to the awful truth…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Too bad you don’t have a pill for
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’m staying with the Countess.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I know, but where do you reside when you
aren’t visiting New York?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Well, no, I don’t reside anywhere in
particular. I just keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: A traveler, eh?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You might say that, although I don’t think of
it as traveling.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: How do you think of it?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: As moving.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: How… unusual…</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Mmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Rupert, before you get too engrossed in your
research on Scotch as a cure for aging, don’t you think you’d better
phone Elaine’s and cancel our dinner reservations?</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: What would we do without you, Carla? Without
our little efficiency expert, Carla, everything would just go to hell.
Carla is thinking about running for mayor next year, aren’t you,
Carla?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Up yours, Herr Doktor Book Salesman. Will the
demands of your medical practice allow you to call Elaine’s or shall
I?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Oh let me do it.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: No Indian blankets… no Indian blankets…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and
went home.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Julian fell asleep on the couch; we covered
him up.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We thought that we should make you
comfortable too.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yes, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly
shaped.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Highly debatable. I’ll wager they’re the
exact same size.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Hmm. Yours are larger, Marie, but Miss
Hankshaw’s – Sissy’s – are more firm. You’d think they would have
started to droop; I mean, from not wearing a bra.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Howard! Watch your manners. You’ve made her
blush. Here, Sissy, let me compare.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: This place is finer than the place I
live!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: So this is what it’s like… so this is what
it’s really like.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Oh, Sissy. I am sorry about all the
fuss.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It is the measure of Western Civilization
that it can encompass in harmony, balance off, as it were, such
divergent masterworks as A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM and THE AMERICAN
DREAM, as the dome of the Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of the Paris
opera.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Here. I’ll turn down the air
conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: It’s not the air conditioner that’s making me
cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Getting dressed. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: But I don’t want you to leave. Please stay.
We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight… we can… really
make love.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I have to go, Julian.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Why? Why do you have to go?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: My thumbs hurt. I’ve made a mistake. I’ve
been negligent. I haven’t exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit
every day, no matter what. It’s like a musician practicing his scales.
When I don’t practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and
sore.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I will hitch with you, out where tall birds
wade in a lake named for my Siwash kin. Out where Smokey the Bear lay
down his shovel to romp with more playful beasts. Out where starlight
has no enemies and the badland wind no friends. Out where the boogie
stops and the woogie begins.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: So she left town. Well, that shouldn’t
surprise you. Leaving town is what Sissy is all about. But tell me, how
did she strike you?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Extraordinary!</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: She’s obviously that. Jesus! Which
would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy’s thumbs full
of pennies?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Oh, you! I’m not talking about her hands.
They’re difficult to ignore, I confess, but I’m speaking of her whole
being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example.
She’s so articulate.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: It’s high time you realized, honey
babe, that a woman doesn’t have to give the best years of her life to
Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Countess. I’m really in a dither. She’s
turned my head.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Ninety degrees to the left, I hope.
How does she feel about you?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I think she’s disappointed that I’m not
more, ah, sort of atavistic. She’s got some naive, sentimental notions
about Indians. I’m sure she liked me, though; but…. then she left
town.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: She always leaves town, you dummy.
That doesn’t mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in
bed?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How does she like what in bed?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Well…. er…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to
tell me you didn’t get it on?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Oh, we didn’t get it all the way on.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Whose fault was that?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely
was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: What do they do to you boys in those
Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of
you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck.
Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he’d be
fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in
the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or
Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they’d
turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps.
Oogie boogie.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: If we Ivy Leaguers aren’t earthy enough to
suit you hillbillies, at least we don’t go around indulging in racist
terms such as ‘Chink.’ Next thing I know, you’ll be calling me
‘chief.’</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Chink’s the guy’s name, for Christ’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Aw, he’s some old fart holyman who
lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies,
too. But though he be old and dirty, he’s alive, I’ll bet, clear down to
his toes. They don’t have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I
suppose that I’ll have to write Sissy out on the road.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Are you a pilgrim?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: No, I’m more of an Indian The trio doesn’t
smile.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: She means are you going to see the
Chink?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Oh, I may and I may not. But seeing him is
not my main objective out here.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That’s good. Because he won’t see you. We
came all the way from Minneapolis to see him and the crazy bastard tried
to stone us to death</p>
<p><strong>other man</strong>: Yeah, but I no longer believe that guy’s
a master. He’s just a dirty, uptight old mountain man. Why, he pulled
out his pecker and shook it at Barbara. I’d stay away from there if I
were you, lady.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: By any chance are you Sissy
Hankshaw?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: My goodness. Why didn’t you telephone?
Someone would have driven into Mottburg to pick you up. I’m Miss Adrian.
From the ranch. The Countess wrote that I should expect you. Get in,
won’t you? You must be exhausted. Gloria, assist Miss Hankshaw with her
luggage.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Little twit. You really ought to have
phoned. We were just in Mottburg escorting some guests to the afternoon
train. More guests leaving ahead of schedule. Three checked out today.
They decided to transfer to Elizabeth Arden’s Maine Chance spa in
Phoenix, Arizona. It costs two hundred and fifty dollars a week less at
the Rubber Rose, so why are our guests leaving and going to Elizabeth
Arden’s?</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: I’ll tell you why, it’s that plague of
cowgirls. They’ve gradually infiltrated every sector of our program. The
one named Debbie considers herself an expert on exercising and diet.
With Bonanza Jellybean’s permission and against my explicit orders,
she’s been coercing the guests into trying something called kundalini
yoga. Do you know what that is? It’s trying to mentally force a serpent
of fire to crawl up your spinal column. Miss Hankshaw, our guests can’t
comprehend kundalini yoga, let alone do it. Yesterday, she ordered a new
cookbook by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third Eye in the Kitchen:
Himalayan Soul Food. God knows what that will be like. The little
barbarians are destroying everything that I’ve built, mocking all that
the company stands for. And there’s a new one, one they call del Ruby.
She has the good will of a scorpion. I’ve considered it prudent to avoid
a confrontation that might further upset the guests. But now that the
season is practically over – we operate April through September – and
the Countess is finally coming…</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian’s voice</strong>: Our Ranch has all the latest in
modern facilities…</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian’s voice</strong>: We have a facial wing, and next
to that is the Hair Barn…</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: We have a team of fifteen hair experts
from all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: And fanny flab flies off in this room
at the rate of six hundred and seventy-five pounds a day… that’s a lot
of salted ham, Sissy….</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw
is with us.</p>
<p><strong>cowgirl</strong>: Cool! We’re going to make a movie!…</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: Get rid of the furniture…. it’s too
masculine… Get rid of all the furniture and use it for kindling!!! Break
away from these pig-like chauvinist masculine influences….</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: O merciful Jesus! They’re murdering the
guests!</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Where are the guests?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Take it easy, lady. They went on a short ride
with the cowgirls. Rode over the hill yonder. You’re Miss Adrian, aren’t
you? We need to talk to you about the filming.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Not now, you fool, not now. Those
crazed bitches have led innocent women out and are slaughtering them at
this moment. We’ll all be killed. Oh! Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: There’s a slaughter going on all right,
but it’s not the fat ladies that are getting it. Your hired hands are
killing the cattle.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: The cattle? They’re killing the cows?
All of them?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: putting a zoom lens</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: How dare you slaughter the Countess’s
cattle! What is a ranch without cows?</p>
<p><strong>cowgirl</strong>: We’re going to replace them with goats.
Most of the cattle are diseased and in pain. We’re just putting them out
of their misery. According to Bon-an-za Jellybean, the Rubber Rose is
in-di-cat-ive of the Countess’s values. He has purchased a cheap weak
strain of cow to begin with and with improper care….</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Oh heavens! I don’t want to hear what
Bonanza Jellybean has been telling you girls…. Come on Sissy. I’ll show
you to your quarters.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Excuse me, Miss. Do you care for your
breakfast now?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yeah. I feel a bit hungry.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Road food. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Well it is a change of our usual grapefruit
and melba toast, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Bonanza Jellybean….</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: She will be up to see you directly.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Welcome, podner. By God, it’s great to have
you here. It’s an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we’ve
had a mess of hard work these past few days – and a heap of planning to
do.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even
what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right.
I’ve done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that’s like telling
Annie Oakley you’re a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can
off a stump with a fieldstone. I’d heard tales about you from people I’d
meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah,
your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac’s girl
friend…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: No, I’m afraid that part isn’t true. Jack was
in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging
in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel
alone.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Well, that doesn’t matter; that part never
interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got
anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich�s and the clap. But the
example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: About…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: About being a cowgirl. What’s it all about?
When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on
the side of a pearl.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common
image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our
culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should
prevail. Otherwise, they’re being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in
Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of ‘em are
trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in
rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do
tricks. That’s what prostitutes call it, you know: ’tricking.’</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You’re political, then?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: No, ma’am. No way. There’s girls on the
Rubber Rose who are political, but I don’t share their views. I got no
cowgirl ideology to expound. “Politics is for people who have a passion
for changing life but lack a passion for living it.”</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Did that last comment sound too profound to
be coming outta my mouth? It’s not original. It’s something I picked up
from the Chink.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Really? The Chink, huh? I’ve gathered that
you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the
Chink?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That’s
hard to say. We mostly…. Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the Chink
taught me something about cowgirls. Did you realize that cowgirls have
been around for many centuries? Long before America. In ancient India
the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called
gopis. Being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully
horny, just like we do here. Every gopi was in love with Krishna, a
good-looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of
style When the moon was full, this Krishna would play his flute by a
river and call the gopis to him. Then he would multiply himself sixteen
thousand times – one for each gopi – and make love to each one the way
she most desired. There they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling
Krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great
that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was God.
Wow! Quite a picture, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: That couldn’t be Krishna, could it? A bit
shrill for a flute. Just our rotten luck.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Gotta run now. Delores says I’m needed.
Somebody’s here. Maybe it’s the Countess.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Sissy, cowgirl history is about to be made.
I’m damn glad you’re here to witness it.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: It’s cute. Way cuter than a cow.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Goats are always testing you. They’re like
Zen masters. They can tell instantly if you’re faking your feelings. So
they play games with you to keep you true. People should go to goats
instead of psychiatrists.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: It’s so loving.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Look at those playfully wise eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ooo! It licked me!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: More and more people are discovering that
cow’s milk isn’t fit for human consumption. Billy West says if we can
produce enough goat’s milk on the ranch to make it worth his while,
he’ll run it into Fargo regularly.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: I’m aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs until
her ninth month, but I don’t think pregnant cowgirls are going to be any
asset on this ranch. I hope you itchy clits who are sneaking down to the
lake every night are taking precautions. It’s bad enough we’ve got
cranes coming; we don’t need storks. I feel that those film makers
should be removed from the Rubber Rose as soon as possible. Men can
cause nothing but trouble here. I also feel that our guest should be
excused while we discuss this matter further.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: ……Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a
week, but so far her Third Vision hasn’t happened. Niwet�kame, the
Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and
Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools.
Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What is Debbie’s position?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Debbie says that if women are to take charge
again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn’t resort to
aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to
show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them
and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She’s a real dreamer, that
Debbie-dear.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You don’t agree with Debbie, then?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: I wouldn’t say that. I expect she’s right,
ultimately. But I’m with Delores when it comes to fighting for what’s
mine. I can’t understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he
could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn’t
it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that
fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I’ll stand with Delores and
fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I’ve always been a
scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a
silver bullet.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: Look at him. Perverse as a pink pickle.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: Sick as a vice squad.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: He’s in a snit. He wants to see you right
after the barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Get the girls. He’s gonna see me right
now.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Any of you ladies who would like to join us,
you’re welcome to stay on as a full working podner at the Rubber Rose.
Rest of you get packed – and I mean now. You’ve got fifteen minutes to
move your lard asses off this ranch.</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: You will all be rounded up and sent to
prison if you take this any farther! This is not your ranch!!!!</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do
you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing
the cause of freedom?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: You owe us this here ranch, as a token
payment for your disgusting exploitations</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Then take it.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Go for it, girls!</p>
<p><strong>miss adrian</strong>: Go to your bunkhouse and remain
there!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Better reach for your spray cans!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Not one of these pussies has been washed in a
week!</p>
<p><strong>the cinematographers’ rented convertible and their
equipment</strong>: VAN drive away.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Ha ha ho ho hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Well, aren’t you going to shake your whanger
at me?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: nervous chipmunk</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’m a friend of Bonanza Jellybean’s.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Oh? Well, there’s been some trouble on the
ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It’s so dark now I doubt if
I could find my way back down. If you could help…</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Save your breath for the climb.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Sissy and the Chink eating supper on a rough
wooden bench.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Yip! Yip! Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Personally, I prefer Stevie Wonder, but what
the hell. Those cowgirls are always bitching because the only radio
station in the area plays nothing but polkas, but I say you can dance to
anything if you really feel like dancing.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: But I don’t know how to polka.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Neither do I… ha ha ho ho hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: So this is how Jelly spends her visits to the
Chink.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Clockworks.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Clockworks?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: The Clockworks is one reason that I am here
on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman
by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the
Clock People.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Siwash, huh?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: He was a degenerated warlock who could turn
urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of
occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to
the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: But unlike the clockworks of the Clock
People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe…. ……ha
ha ho ho and hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: The Clock People?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: During the Second World War I busted out of
Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there
and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered
me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra
Nevada mountains.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Then if you are Japanese, then why are you
called the Chink?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And
the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be
labeled “Indians” through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a
taste for oranges, it is only fitting that “Indians” misnamed me. The
Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of
Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: The pivotal function of the Clock People is
the keeping and observing of the clockworks. It is a real thing, and is
kept at the center, at the soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar as it is
possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of
the clockworks. Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily
visits to the clockworks is to check the time.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: These people have no other ritual than this
one. Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a
continuum they call the Eternity of Joy. It is into the Eternity of Joy
that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed.
The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means,
must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute
stirrings thoughtless people call “earthquakes.”</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: The Earth is alive. She burns inside with the
heat of cosmic longing. She longs to be with her husband again. She
moans. She turns softly in her sleep. In the Eternity of Joy,
pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will
smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake. I loved those loony
redskins, but I couldn’t be a party to their utopian dreaming. After a
while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity
of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second
Coming. Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. Or the
Debbies waiting for the flying saucers. All the same. Just more suckers
betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery
on a happy ending to history. Well, history is ending every second -
happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second,
unhappily the next. History is always ending and always not ending… ha
ha ho ho and hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What do you believe in then?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: If this be adultery, make the most of it.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Sissy, don’t play dumb with me! You’re
a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this
whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last
seen in Nebraska. Didn’t make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between
Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And
who else but Jellybean’s wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing
something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly
extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those
cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I don’t know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Sissy. You’re trying to protect those
scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy
used to say, but it won’t work. Those stinking sluts are going to
suffer…</p>
<p><strong>the countess</strong>: Shit O dear.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Well, he’s not out of danger, but I think
we can safely say he’s going to make it. I’d be pretty surprised if he
didn’t. However, there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe, and I
have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent. The patient may
never again function as a normal human being.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Brain damage? You mean he’s going to be a
vegetable?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn’t say that,
no. We won’t ascertain the extent of the injury for some days. But there
is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects. I
wouldn’t classify it in the vegetable category, however.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’m going to give it to you like you’ve
never had it before. Oh, you didn’t know it could be this good. You’re
gonna like it. You’re gonna like it. You’re gonna like it so good.
You’re gonna love it so much you’re gonna cry. You’re gonna cry. You’re
gonna cry and cry. Do you like to cry? Do you like it when it hurts a
little bit? Whatever happens to you, it’ll be worth it. The way I’m
gonna give it to you, it’ll be worth anything. Everything. Go ahead and
cry if you want to. I like it when women cry. It means they appreciate
me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: But Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dreyfus</strong>: Please, child, don’t be dismayed. We all
have problems these days. But as the painter Van Gogh said, ‘Mysteries
remain, sorrow or melancholy remains, but the everlasting negative is
balanced by the positive work which thus is achieved, after all.’ I
don’t suppose that means very much to you. I have retired. A victim of a
malpractice suit.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Oh, Doctor! You’ve got to do it. You and
nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: Ah, the thumb.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: The thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb
the thumb the thumb. One of evolution’s most ingenious inventions; a
built-in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an
alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the
mind and art; a humanizing device. The marmoset and the lemur are
thumbless; none of the New World monkeys has opposable thumbs; the
spider monkey’s thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the
thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to
the other digits.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: And so you are demanding at last the
privileges of thumb that nature has perversely denied you?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I just want to be normal, give me that
old-fashioned normality. It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it’s
good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. dreyfus</strong>: Ah, yes. Very well, my dear. Here is
what we can do.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Yep, the whooping cranes are here all right.
They’re in fine shape, and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly
machine, unrestrained, free to go as they please. But this is private
property and you aren’t laying a foot on it. None of you.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: We’ll be back with a court order and a
fistful of search warrants.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Just come back with a couple of people who
know what they’re doing and we’ll let’em in for a nice close look at the
birds.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: And make sure at least one of them is
female, and you better do as we say or there may be trouble.</p>
<p><strong>the assistant interior undersecretary is speaking into
a</strong>: MICROPHONE FOR THE NEWS, and reading from a paper in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: It will be my extreme pleasure to
report to the President…</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: …who has been gravely concerned
about the fate of our whooping cranes….</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: …and to the Interior Secretary and
to the American people that the entire flock of cranes is, indeed,
at…</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary voice</strong>: …Siwash Lake and in apparently
healthy condition.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary voice</strong>: ….The cranes have built
brooding nests around the whole circumference of the small lake, and
have…</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: ….hatched chicks there. Counting the
young birds, there are now approximately sixty cranes in the flock.
While this is good news, it is also quite bewildering…</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: …Whooping cranes are territorially
minded and have never been known to nest as close as a mile to one
another, yet here they are virtually side by side.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a
communiqu� that was sent to the federal judge and copies of a recording
to the press, today.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: That’s Jellybean!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Man, this is the stupidest music I’ve ever
heard. This radio should have stayed in the privy where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You know what you’re getting into if you come
over to the lake…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yes, but I want to be there. I want to see
Jellybean. I want to see the cranes.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: We heard on the radio that the judge has set
Delores’s bail at fifty thousand dollars. Now she won’t be here when we
really need her.</p>
<p><strong>radio news report</strong>: The American Civil Liberties
Union has requested an extension for the Rubber Rose Ranch. The
government is aware of the inflamed situation and are afraid that all
the marshals and agents might be too willing to uncork the bottle of
blood…</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Let’s celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Ain’t that just like women.</p>
<p><strong>below</strong>: The cowgirls.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Looks like every time we get together things
are in a mess.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: So be it. It looks serious this time, though.
All these guns… are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping
cranes?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but
I’m not in this for whooping cranes. I’m in it for cowgirls. If we
cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become
just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that – for me and for
every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls
compromised.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: How did this business get started, anyhow?
Why are the birds nesting here?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You were aware that we were feeding them,
weren’t you? We fed them brown rice and they stayed over a couple of
extra days. Then we decided to try something different. We mixed our
brown rice with fishmeal – whoopers love seafood, and fishmeal is cheap.
Then Delores suggested another ingredient, and we think that’s what did
the trick.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You mean…</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: They’re drugged.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Aw, come off it, Sissy. What do you mean,
‘drugged’? Every living thing is a chemical composition and anything
that is added to it changes that composition. When you eat a
cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers bar, it changes your body chemistry.
The kind of food you eat, the kind of air you breathe, can change your
mental state. Does that mean you’re ‘drugged’?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: No, I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: ‘Drugged’ is a stupid word.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: But the peyote is obviously affecting their
brains. It’s made them break a migratory pattern that goes back
thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: The way I see it, is that the peyote
mellowed them out. Made them less uptight. They were afraid of bad
weather and humans. That’s why they migrated and kept to themselves. But
the peyote has enlightened them. It’s taught them there is nothing to
fear but fear itself. Now they’re digging life and letting the bad vibes
slide on. Don’t worry, be happy. Be here now.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Fear in wild animals is completely different
from paranoia in people. In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural
and necessary. It’s merely a mechanism for maintaining life. If the
cranes hadn’t had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long
ago and you’d be having to get loaded with common old everyday
meadowlarks and mallards.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: This here discussion is destined to become
academic. Because we’ve got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left
and Delores’s run ended up in the Mottburg jail. So any day now we’ll
get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see
if the peyote experience really changed them or not. But in the
meantime, I want to say this about fear…..</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Judge Greenfield, at the request of the
ACLU, has granted a forty-eight- hour extension of the deadline by which
the Rubber Rose cowgirls must comply with his order. Negotiations
between the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow. Another
item in, the forewoman of the Rubber Rose Ranch, a Delores del Ruby is
now free on bond after having been arrested in Mottburg with more than
fifty pounds of peyote buttons. Her bail has been paid by the owner of
the besieged ranch, Countess Products, Inc. Miss del Ruby’s bail having
come from the tycoon’s personal advisor, a certain Dr. Robbins of New
York City.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Dr. Robbins?</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Every time I tell you that I love you, you
flinch. But that’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: If I flinch when you say you love me, it’s
both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse
teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts
confuse lovers with clear hearts….</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: It isn’t for ourselves that we take this
stand. It isn’t for cowgirls. It’s for all the daughters everywhere.
This is an extremely important confrontation. This is womankind’s chance
to prove to her enemy that she’s willing to fight and die. If we women
don’t show here and now that we aren’t afraid to fight and die, then our
enemy will never take us seriously. Men will always know that, no matter
how strong our words and determined our deeds, there’s a point where
we’ll back down and give them their way.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: I’m prepared to win! Victory for every
female, living or dead, who’s suffered the temporary defeats of
masculine insensitivity to their inner lives!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I’ll fight the bastards.</p>
<p><strong>big red</strong>: I’ll fight ’em with bean gas, if
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: The sun’s going down. Let’s those of us not
standing watch get some sleep. In the morning we’ll plan our fight.
Tomorrow afternoon those of you who’d like can join me in the reeds,
where the cranes and I will be sharing the last crumbs left in the
peyote sack.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: It is woman’s mission to destroy as well as
to give birth. We will destroy the tyranny of the dull. But we can’t
destroy it with guns. Or whips. Violence is the dullard’s Breakfast of
Champions and the logical end product of his or her misplaced pride.
Violence fertilizes that which we would starve. No, we will destroy the
enemy in other ways. The Peyote Mother has promised a Fourth Vision. But
it won’t come to me alone. It will come to each of you, to every cowgirl
in the land, when you have overcome that in your own self which is dull.
The Fourth Vision will come to some men too. You will recognize them
when you meet them, and be their steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic
escapades of poetic behavior and romance.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: First thing, you must end this business
with the government and the cranes. It’s been positive and fruitful, but
it’s gone far enough. Playfulness ceases to serve a serious purpose when
it takes itself too seriously. Sorry I won’t be with you at the
conclusion. As you know, I’ve been sick and stupid for a long time. I
have a lot to make up for, a lot to accomplish, and there’s someone
important that I’ve got to see. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Well, what we got to do is one of us has got
to go up that hill and tell them boys that America can have its whooping
cranes back. Since I’m the boss here, and since I’m responsible for a
lot of you choosing to be cowgirls in the first place, it’s gonna be me
that goes…</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: No buts about it. It’s getting lighter by the
second. You podners keep your heads down. Ta ta.</p>
<p><strong>cowgirl</strong>: Jelly! Please!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Better get rid of these. Might give those
greenhorn dudes a fright.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: She’s going to fire….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve got two minutes to come out with you
hands over your heads!</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden
horse when I was twelve. Haw, I wasn’t really shot with a silver
bullet.</p>
<p><strong>jelly</strong>: Or was I?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: The brown paper bag is the only thing
civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature.
Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, like the fossilized brain of a dryad;
its kinship to tree unobscured by the cruel crush of industry; absorbing
the elements like any other organic entity; blending with rock and
vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl’s door mat or a jack rabbit’s
underwear, a No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of Dakota
and appeared to live where it lay. Once long ago, it had borne a package
of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried
hamburger. More recently, the bag had held…….. love letters.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel’s family
jewels, the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a bunkhouse
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then one day after work, the button- nosed
little cowgirl to whom the letters were addressed gathered bag and
contents under her arm, slipped out to the corral…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …past ranch hands pitching horseshoes and
ranch hands flying Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted into the
hills.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she
dismounted and built a small fire; she fed the fire letters.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …one by one, the way her girl friend had once
fed her french fries.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: As words such as sweetheart” and “honey
britches” and “forever” and “always” burned away, the cowgirl squirted a
few tears. Her eyes were so misty she forgot to burn the bag.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: You know, podner, you can tune a guitar but
you can’t tuna fish.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: God, but it’s good to be a cowgirl.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Is everything getting worse?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Yes, everything is getting worse. But
everything is also getting better.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber
Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been
asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the
Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was…
here’s a picture!</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind
of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they’re up to. What’s
happened to Jelly?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: You mean she’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: But that’s an old story now…… I can’t believe
that you would leave the Butte.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p><strong>delores</strong>: Wow, you sure have a way with words.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: I can’t help it if I grew up in an antipoetic
culture. Language will be different when I’m with the Clock People
though. They’re from an oral tradition. And I’m not talking about what
you horny hop toads do in bed every night.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Well, if the Clock People give you any inside
information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: The world isn’t going to end, you dummy; I
hope you know that much. But it is going to change. It’s going to change
drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see
calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right,
since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are
long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming… unless the
human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of
civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit
– and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most
of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of
progressive consumption. It isn’t merely that our bad habits will cause
global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic
philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from
preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the
apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there’ll be
some of us it’ll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock
People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease
on Siwash Cave. There’s almost no worldwide calamity – famine, nuclear
accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield –
that you couldn’t survive in that cave.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Suppose that you bear five or six children
with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe
world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a
tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big
Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could
not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on
its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals – and
plants! – as virtual equals. It’s extremely pleasant to me to think
about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and
plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect
they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: How am I going to be the progenitor of a
tribe when I’m living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: That’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Listen to the way I’m babbling. That bullet
must have loosened one of my transistors. Don’t pay any attention to me.
You’ve got to work it out for yourself. The westbound choo-choo leaves
Mottburg at one-forty. I want to be on it. Will you drive me to the
station?</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Schedules! Ironic how I have to follow
timetables in order to get back to the clockworks.</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: Don’t ever bet against paradox, ladies…</p>
<p><strong>chink</strong>: ….if complexity doesn’t beat you, then
paradox will. Ha ha ho ho and hee hee…..</p>
