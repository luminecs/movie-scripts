<p><strong>t w i n p e a k s</strong>: ——————-</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: OK, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: OK, Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Okay, Gordon!!!</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Smell something fishy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s a pleasure. I’ve heard a lot about
you.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Congratulations. I heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Federal?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Right, Gordon. We’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That was really something. That dancing
girl. What did it mean?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Code. If you work with Gordon you learn
that right away.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Code, I’ve heard a lot about this.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Sort of shorthand.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shorthand. really?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: We’re heading into a difficult
situation.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I’ll explain it to you. Do you remember
Lil’s dance?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Lil was wearing a sour face.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Her face had a sour look… that means we’re
going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to
be receptive to the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Both eyes blinking means there is going to
be trouble higher up… the eyes of the local authority. A sheriff and a
deputy. That would be my guess. Two of the local law enforcers are going
to be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, the uncle is missing.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Not Cole’s Uncle but probably the sheriff’s
uncle in federal prison.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So the sheriff had got an Uncle who’s
committed a serious crime.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Right, which is probably why Lil was
wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let
me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the
dress?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The dress she was wearing had been altered
to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had
been taken in. It wasn’t her dress or she must have lost some
weight.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Gordon said you were good. The tailored
dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A blue rose.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Very good, but I can’t tell you about
that.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What did Gordon’s tie mean?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What? That’s just Gordon’s bad taste.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why couldn’t he have just told you all
these things?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: He talks loud. And he loves his code.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I see. He does talk loud.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Gordon would not have sent us to Deer
Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It must be a high priority situation.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I’d like to see Sheriff
Cable.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Why don’t you folks have a seat. Make
yourself at home. It’s gonna be a while.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Okay, that’s it. I’ve had enough of the
waiting room now.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: You can start that FRESH pot of coffee
right now.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: How the hell did you…</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
Agent Chet Desmond.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Well, little fella, we don’t need any outside
help here. I don’t like you people sniffin’ around my neck of the woods.
In fact, when the state boys called me about a “J. Edgar” coming up I
think I said, “So what?”</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Your behavior is not funny and is wasting
the time of the Federal Government.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You’re lucky I am not wasting you.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Well, little fella, let me put it this way.
The operative word here would be “Federal”. With or without the
semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent
information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody
knew her. My boys have been all over this. It’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: That’s why we’re here, Sheriff Cable.
Where’s the body?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Out back in our morgue</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: We’ve got our own clock. We’ll lock up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this
whole office, furniture included, is worth 27,000 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer
Park for a month. We’ll check that. And worked as a waitress at Hap’s
Truck Stop. Worked the Night Shift. Good place for dinner when we’re
thru here, Sam. No one came to claim the body and no known next of
kin.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Solved the Whiteman Case with this.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: That’s what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No one could find those splinters without a
machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes, it is good. What do you think is in
these other drawers?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I don’t know, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Maybe, later we could take a look.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Sure, but let’s finish up with this
first.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated
blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object.
Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Cole said she was 17.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I wonder where her ring is?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Yeah. Personal effects include a watch,
under garments, and a blue waitress uniform… the ring is missing. It
says the rest of her things haven’t been removed yet from the trailer.
Let’s hope it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: There appears to be a contusion under the
ring finger of her left hand.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A laceration.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Accidental?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger
for me. There’s something up there.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It is a piece of paper with the letter “T”
imprinted on it. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Geez, Agent Desmond, it’s three-thirty in
the morning. Where are we going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: We’re not. You and I are going to get some
food.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes, it’s been several hours since we’ve
eaten. I didn’t realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent
Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Had the FBI here once before. Back in the
fifties when Hap was running the place.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Where’s Hap?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s dead - good and dead.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Sorry to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He didn’t suffer.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I’d like to ask you a few questions about
Teresa Banks</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sheriff Cable’s already asked me a few
questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Any friends?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Ever see her with someone else?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Did she ever mention any friends?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. Ask Irene over there.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Take a good look around. There’s nobody in
this place - you’re meetin’ the reason why. What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: How come Jack let’s you work here?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Say no more.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
Agent Chet Desmond. I’d like to ask you a few questions about Teresa
Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: She only worked here a month. Nice girl.
Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem
with –</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: There was only one job. Teresa took the job.
Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Do you take cocaine, Irene?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any
other drugs. I don’t take drugs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nicotine is a drug. Caffeine is a drug.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Who’s Shorty? Those drugs are legal.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: He’s with me. Anything you would like to
tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ve thought about that. I think her death is
what you would call a “freak accident”.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: You talking about that little girl that was
murdered?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: You have something to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: I can tell shit from shinolah. Gets me
along way down that road.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You think we ought to question him?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What time is it, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Agent Desmond, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: It’s late, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s not late, it’s early. Really
early.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You know, I never told anybody, but once for
about three days, just before her time, Teresa’s arm went completely
dead.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Her left arm. It was numb. She said she
couldn’t use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was
taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem
with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve
work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I think we should see the sun rise at the
Canyon Trailer Park.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are you speaking to me in a code?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: No, Sam, I’m speaking plainly and I mean
just exactly what I say.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: In that case, we should go to the Canyon
Trailer Park.</p>
<p><strong>stanley and desmond</strong>: Thanks, Irene. Good… Good
morning.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thank god it is morning.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nine’s really late. We are really
early.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: God damn, this better be important.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we
would like to see Teresa Banks’ trailer, please.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: More popular than Uncle’s Day at a
whorehouse.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Did she have someone with her?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Right. She had a friend with her. The friend
took off.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Was there an argument?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not that I know of. But arguments do happen,
don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Yes they do. Did she have visitors?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing
to Sheriff “Not-Quite-Able”… Here’s the trailer now.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: She lived alone.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: She must have known someone.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ll get my kit.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: 5,600 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: She’s wearing a ring.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: My guess is there isn’t enough detail in
the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a
blowup of this anyway.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: May I see the magnifying glass, Agent
Desmond? There doesn’t seem to be enough detail in the photo to
ascertain the design on the ring.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m gonna make myself some Good Morning
America. You want some?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: You weren’t kiddin’. This stuff’s got the
sting of the forty-eight hour blend.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s right. That’s the best coffee you’re
gonna get around here.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We really do need a good “wake me up”,
don’t we, Agent Desmond? We really do need a good “wake me up”, don’t
we, Agent Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Did you know Teresa Banks?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Hey, how’s J. Edgar doin’? Bet you appreciate
them bustin’ your mornin’ in half, eh, Carl? Bet they woke you up.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: They’re only doing their job.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: What are you doing here in the trailer
court, Deputy?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Maybe I just live here, what do you think
about that?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Can I ask you where you were the night
Teresa Banks was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party
and I got fifteen fuckin’ witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Maybe if you did a little less partyin’ that
little girl would still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Did you know Teresa Banks?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap’s from
her. That’s it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I
could ask you the same question.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: No you couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Is there a golf course around here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but
not very many fellas with balls.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke
you up.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s alright. I was having a bad dream. I
was dreamin’ about a joke with no punchline.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I couldn’t help but notice that you had a
suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn’t
you, Agent Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: He’s not the murderer. But he’s a bozo.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes, he is like a clown.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: What the hell is that thing doing out there?
You’re not taking that body anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: We’re taking the body back to Portland and
there’s not a thing you can do about it.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Maybe not <em>a</em> thing, but maybe
<em>two</em> things.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what
happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: We got a phone, here, that’s got a little
ring.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Sam, get the body and put it in the van.
Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: My alibi is as strong as these bands of
steel.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: When he says, “Discussion”, how do you take
that, Agent Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I don’t take it, Sam. I give it.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Now, J. Edgar, I’m going to take off my
badge, here. Do you mind? The only way you’re going to get that body is
over mine.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: You try that you little monkey.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I think I’ll take off my badge as well.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: This one’s comin’ from J. Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Who’s next?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Take the van back to Portland, Stanley. I’m
going to take one more look at the trailer park.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: One thing that has been troubling me. That
lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic
reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Faulty wiring.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Esthetics are subjective, aren’t they,
Agent Desmond? I’m Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a
good eye for detail.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: We do notice things, don’t we, Agent
Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: 83,000 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: And that’s Deputy Cliff’s trailer over there.
The red one.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll be in my trailer if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Six to eight hands clapping. I was referring
to the possibility of a little silence.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I know you haven’t changed your hair and
I’ve seen that beautiful dress before, but I must say, Diane, you look
sensational today.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: No, I am not trying to buy time. It’s
Thursday and I know you have changed something in the room… and this
time you’ve done very well… And I am going to tell you exactly what it
is… in a moment… you have moved… Got it! It’s the clock, you’ve moved it
12 inches to the left. Another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper. And
you, Diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee
from Sally and make a damn great pot of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What is it, Gordon?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Agent Chet said he wanted to check the
trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back
here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I’m up to speed, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Agent Chet wouldn’t tell me what the Blue
Rose meant.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: And neither will I.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent
Desmond. He had his own M.O.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I cracked the Whiteman case with this.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Stanley, I heard all about it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No one could’ve found those splinters
without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Tell me about the letter.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Take a look at this. Chet and I found it
under Teresa Banks’ ring fingernail.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: And no one found the ring?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, sir, we did not.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m Sam Stanley, if you ever need me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: GOD. I’m beginning to lose faith in the United
States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don’t you
folks talk to one another. That’s her trailer there and I haven’t
touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and
asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard’s trailer …which I showed him. I went
back to my trailer… After that I never saw him again.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Thank you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s not the way to Cliff’s trailer. I told
you.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I am not going to Cliff’s trailer.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I am going over here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: God damn, you people are confusing.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What was here, Mr. Rodd?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A trailer was here. What the hell do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Can you tell me who’s trailer it was… and
who stayed in the trailer?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: An old woman and her grandson.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Can you tell me what their names were?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the
folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Is that Agent Desmond’s vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yep, it sure is.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Diane, it’s 4:20 in the afternoon. I am
standing here at Wind River where they found the body of Teresa Banks.
Diane, this case has got a strange feeling for me. Not only has Agent
Chester Desmond disappeared but this is one of Cole’s Blue Rose cases.
The clues that were found by Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have lead
to dead ends. The letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that
the killer will strike again. But like the song says, “…who knows where
or when”.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Gordon, it is 10:10, on February 15th.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: I was worried about today from the dream I
told you about.</p>
<p><strong>head clerk</strong>: Here’s your key, Mr. Jeffries. I hope
you enjoy your stay here at The Palm Deluxe. This is for you. The joven…
ah… young lady… she left it.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: 612 — very nice.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: I’m not going to talk about Judy. Keep
Judy out of this.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: Who do you think that is there?</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Suffered some bumps on the old noggin’, eh,
Phil?</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: I want to tell you everything, but I don’t
have a lot to go on. But I’ll tell you one thing: Judy is positive about
this.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: How interesting. I thought we were going to
keep Judy out of this.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: Listen to me carefully. I saw one of their
meetings. It was above a convenience store.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Who’s meeting? Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: It was a dream. We live inside a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: And it’s raining Post Toasties.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: NO, NO. I found something… in Seattle at
Judy’s… And then, there they were…</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: They sat quietly for hours.</p>
<p><strong>first woodsman</strong>: We have descended from pure air.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: Going up and down.
Intercourse between the two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Light of new discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. tremond</strong>: Why not be composed of materials and
combinations of atoms?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. tremond’s grandson</strong>: This is no accident.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: This is a formica table.
Green is its color.</p>
<p><strong>first woodsman</strong>: Our world.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: With chrome. Any everything
will proceed cyclically.</p>
<p><strong>second woodsman</strong>: Boneless.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes, find the middle place.</p>
<p><strong>tremond’s grandson</strong>: Fell a victim.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: Fire Walk With Me…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Fire Walk With Me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: I followed.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: The ring… ring…</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: May? 1989?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I’ve got the front desk right now. He never
was here. No record of him entering the building… and the doctors should
be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Teresa Banks.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Tylenol.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks
was killed. I’m wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: No offense, sir, but after a day with you it
is mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>jeffries</strong>: Hey… hey…</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Oh, Mr. Jeffries. De shit it come out of my
ass! Santa Maria, where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: He was here.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Donna?… Donna?…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Just a minute, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: If I am going to get through math today,
you’re going to have to bring me up to speed quick.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You didn’t do your homework?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Noooo…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Okay, this test is going to be about the
theorems I told you about last week. You remember the…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t tell me now. Tell me right before the
test. I won’t be able to remember long enough.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You graduating this year will be proof that
miracles happen.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: James called me last night looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: The usual, 9:15.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He probably wanted to drive over.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still
fighting?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, and yes. I don’t know what I’m going to
do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that’s okay with
me, and he thinks I’m seeing someone else and that’s not okay with
him.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Are you going to tell him about that “someone
else”?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You know what your problem is? You’re just
too adorable…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You know, I think you’re right. I’m just too
adorable.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Laura Palmer, you’re just too adorable.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m just too adorable. I’m just too
adorable.</p>
<p><strong>admirers</strong>: “Laura… Donna… Laura… Donna…”</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s why you need a real man, Babe, you’re
tough to handle.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: And you’re the real man?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: James…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Laura, I’ll meet you at 2:30 after phys.
ed.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Hey, Baby.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Laura, do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes, I love you. I’ve told you, but it
doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Why? It does.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, it doesn’t… just kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It does matter. We’re in love.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: James, you don’t know what you are talking
about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I’m gone… long gone like a
turkey through the corn.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re not a turkey. A turkey is one of the
dumbest birds on earth.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Gobble, gobble, gobble.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Don’t ever leave, Laura, ever. I’ll never
leave you.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Where were you for the last hour? I’ve been
lookin’ for you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I was right behind you, but you’re too dumb
to turn around. If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall
down.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Get lost Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Oh, yeah? You’ll be callin’ soon and maybe
I’m not gonna be there.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Love ya, Babe.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hi, E.H.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Mom H.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Why are you suddenly so interested in who I
am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You’re telling me, but only because you never
let me in on any of it… you’re not going to see Bobby, are you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Oh god, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Well, why not?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Because Bobby is a loser, you said so
yourself. He’s a goon. James is the one. He loves you with that “lasting
love”… “true love”.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes, James is very sweet. Why don’t you get
out your violin, Donna?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Sweet? God, he’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: James is very sweet and very gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I wonder if Mike could ever write a poem?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Faster and faster. For a long time you
wouldn’t feel anything. Then you would burst into fire… forever.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Maybe I better start our homework.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay, I suppose I should go home.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Sure. What do you want me to call you?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Call me anything just don’t call me late for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mom… Mom?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Laura, honey… Cigarette… Cigarette…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Can I take the car?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sure honey, what’s the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I forgot my books at school.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’ll never be a smoker if you don’t</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: My secret diary. There are pages missing.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Who would do that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But Bob isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The pages are gone. That’s real.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Bob is real. He’s been “having” me since I
was 12.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What does Bob say?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He wants to be me… or he will kill me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No… No…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, yes… yes…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What? Please.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The trees… the trees…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You’re not Bob are you, Harold? If you are,
you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Laura, no, I’m not. I’m not Bob. Poor Laura.
I wish I could help you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it.
But now I’m afraid. I am so afraid.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But you’re strong Laura… so much stronger
than I… How can I help you? I can’t. I can’t even go outside.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s in love with a girl who’s dead. It
<em>is</em> dangerous for you to have it. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m so sorry, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I don’t know when I can come back. Maybe
never.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You lied to me about those school books. I
found them upstairs on your bed.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What were you doing in my room?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I was looking for that blue sweater that you
borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why
did you lie to me? Where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I had to see Bobby. I know you really don’t
like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn’t think you would
understand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, honey, you don’t have to lie to me. Ever.
You can tell me anything. I’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m sorry, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Now hurry, dinner’s almost ready. Your father
says he’s starving.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where’s my axe?
“I’m hungry”.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Leland.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland
Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: The Norwegians are coming next week and I
want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can
talk to them. I want you to learn to say, “Hello, my name is Leland
Palmer”.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: But my name isn’t Leland Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Neither is mine. And can’t we talk about
something serious for a change.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne’s got a
delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to
learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland
Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Sarah
Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Good. We’ll practice some more. Laura, now
you try it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Laura
Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: All together now…</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Friend of Leo’s, right? Partyland?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: If you can fuck and drive the party starts
right now.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up
above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole’s practice of word
association works?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: The very fact that we are talking about word
association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice
of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Yes, it’s a great big psychedelic circus
ride, isn’t it, Cooper?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Albert.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: You said, “Teresa Banks”, so you think
something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected
with her murder?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Yes. Either right now or right when I
thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me.
Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will
strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it.
And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me
solve it.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Let’s test it for the record. Will the next
victim be a man or a woman?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: A woman.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: What color hair will she have?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Blonde.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Tell me some other things about her.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: She’s in high school. She’s sexually active.
She’s on drugs. She’s crying out for some help.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: You’re describing half the high school girls
in America. What is she doing right now?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: She is preparing a great abundance of
food.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand
with the “Meals on Wheels”?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m kind of busy, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re not busy, sweetheart, now go.</p>
<p><strong>nadine</strong>: I changed my mind, I don’t want any coffee,
Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sorry, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Can I give you a hand getting the dinners
together?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s alright, Shelly. I know you have
better things to do.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Norma asked me to give you a hand.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. You can help me carry them to the
car.</p>
<p><strong>tremond</strong>: This would look nice on your wall.</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: He’s looking for a book with pages torn
out. He’s walking towards the hiding place. He’s moving under the fan
now.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Shelly, you really can help me. I can’t do
the “Meals on Wheels” today. I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Laura just took off. She asked me to do the
run today. Should I do it?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What’s with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a
look around. There’s no one here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You’re right. There’s no one here.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: There’s no one here.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Norma, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Come back as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: If Leo comes here, he won’t believe that I
am out doing the “Meals on Wheels”.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t worry, Shelly, I’ll handle Leo.</p>
<p><strong>toad</strong>: Kind of quiet.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s looking for the book, he’s going to the
hiding place!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What? It can’t be… It can’t be him… no…
no…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Laura…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What… Laura are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I… lost my necklace… it must have fallen.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, here it is.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, I’m glad you found it, darling.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Donna, are you my best friend?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Of course…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What is it Laura? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I just want a friend. Just one friend for
just one minute…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Laura, how about one friend for the rest of
your whole life?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Yes, that’s what I want. Thanks D.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Okay, L. toward confronting something I am
your friend… always. But sometimes… lately… I feel that you don’t like
being around me because I am so uptight. No, I am uptight. I hate it… I
don’t want to be this way, but Laura I don’t… I mean… I’m your friend no
matter what way you are.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You know, even when I think about your face I
get happier.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Do you want to talk?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, I want to smoke.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I’m in a mess today, too. I’m thinking about
doing it with Mike. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Donna, you are such a crack up. You don’t
even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not
uptight.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: This is about sex, not like. Mom, Laura’s
here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. You want
a muffin?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: If I can smoke it.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You want a muffin?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Donna, you are a muffin.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The red rose. Where is the red rose? You know
the light at Sparkwood and 21? It worked right there. I just did it
right there.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why is it that you can’t smoke at your home and
I’m a doctor and I don’t allow smoking in my home and I let you smoke in
my home?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Because you love me so much.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I do love you, you little smoking whipper
snapper.</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: These muffins each have at least seven full
huckleberries in them.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Dad, what in the world are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: It’s a prescription.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My handwriting is so bad that now I can’t even
read it. You girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you
can take care of me.</p>
<p><strong>donna and laura</strong>: We’ll take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yep, she’s right here, Leland… It’s for you.
It’s your father.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>leland’s voice</strong>: Time to come home for dinner,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Goodbye, Muffin.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, you’re the muffin.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, you’re right. I am the muffin.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hi, honey, how’s Donna?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: School?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: …school’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Sit down… sit down… Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: You didn’t wash your hands before you sat
down for dinner did you?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Your hands are filthy… look, there is dirt
way under this fingernail.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Leland, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Look at this finger here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Leland…</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Laura didn’t wash her hands before dinner.
And look at this.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Oh, is this from a lover?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They don’t call them lovers in high school,
Leland.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Bobby didn’t give you this?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How would you know if Bobby didn’t give her
that?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Did Bobby give you that or is there someone
new?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Leland leave her alone… She doesn’t like
that. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: How do you know what she doesn’t like?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Oh, I’ll sit down, but none of us are going
to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What is it, Leland?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: I can’t remember the last time I told Laura
that I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, honey, go in and tell her now.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Laura, honey…</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Goodnight, Princess.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: Is it future? Or is it
past?… Do you know who I am?… I am the Arm… And I sound like this…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Don’t take the ring… Laura, don’t take the
ring.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My name is Annie. I’ve been with Laura and
Dale. The good Dale is in the lodge and he can’t leave. Write it in your
diary.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Where were you last night? We were supposed
to get together. You didn’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You were supposed to show up. Maybe I
wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: We were supposed to be together.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: How can I be together if I’m not
together?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re on somethin’ again, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: James…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: When am I going to see you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: A friend from school.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: A special friend?</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No… No, go away.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: I’m glad you let me talk to you. You
used to not let me talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Go away. I am not talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: I want you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Laura?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Laura, now I can’t find that blue sweater.
Did you take it again?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mom… what are you wearing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: My god, I am going to have another breakdown.
God, god.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mom, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, no… this can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mom, you’re not having a nervous
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Someone who knows how to clean knows where the
object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to
its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is.
Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture
where every item is.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Lay off the bennies, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but
dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below
the surface.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: As if I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I’m going to show you how to wash this tile and
then you’re going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Come off it, Leo. I’m late for work…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore. The
first thing you’ve got to WORK on is a good attitude. That’s the key.
Anybody will tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Don’t even <em>think</em> about going anywhere,
Shelly. I’m not finished with you.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: What are you doing calling me here?… No way,
you already owe me money… Five thousand, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Five Thousand???</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: How come you only call me when you are
desperate? Are you desperate, baby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You interested or not?</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Maybe, Bobby, baby. Maybe. I have friend
who has what you want. His stuff is the best.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jacques… you crazy Canadian. This sounds
BIG…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No place, fast. And you’re not coming.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Come on, Laura. I’m your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Isn’t tonight the night you are going to do
it with Mike?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Laura, aren’t you going to fix me a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Where are the Cookies?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You mean Fred and Ginger?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Dancing.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: If I had a nickel for every cigarette your
mom smoked, I’d be dead.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Gotta go, Donna. I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>log lady</strong>: When this kind of fire starts. it is very
hard to put out.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Margaret?</p>
<p><strong>log lady</strong>: The tender bows of innocence burn first
and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Let’s go around the world, babe.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: This isn’t going to get you to Walla-
Walla.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You do go all the way, don’t you, little
girl?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You willing to go all the way? Huh? You wanna
do it for me. All the way for me means all the way - DEAD.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Let’s boogie.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You part of the deal?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, she isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Buck.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Buck, that was really nice.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I’m goin’ for it.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: No. I don’t need to take this to be you
friend.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you

<p><strong>buck</strong>: Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hold on, I’m chokin’ the farm fed.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t expect a turkey dog in here.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Hey, slow pokes, guess what? There’s no
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Baby, you know why? Cause it’ll never get
here.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hey, Jacques…</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: No “Jacques”. I am the Great Went.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I am The Muffin.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: And what a muffin you have.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: I am as blank as a fart.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Oh, Laura’s friend. I am “The Great
Went”.</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: You smell nice.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Haven’t seen you since I was thrown out of
One Eyed Jacks.</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: What else did we do together? Oh, I
remember… Hey, you know what? It’s been a year. She’s been dead a year…
she’s been dead a year.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: The party twins. My high school sandwich.
Let’s put some meat inside…</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: She’s been dead a year.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: Teresa…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Teresa Banks? Yeah, a whole year.</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: Yeah, she was going to get rich… she was
blackmailing somebody…</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: That’s right. She called me. She even asked
me what your fathers looked like…</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What? She asked about my father?</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: But it wasn’t him… she was after a huge
guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a
boxer. Speaking of sandwiches… I think Bobby was arranging something for
you… Speaking of arrangements… SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS… Why don’t you
two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is
coming to town… Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>ronette and laura</strong>: Okay, Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: “The Great Went”.</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: Here we go again. Like we’re back at One
Eyed Jacks.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, god. It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>ronette</strong>: Shit, is that Donna Hayward?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Okay, I won’t wear your stuff… Why can’t I
wear your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I won’t wear your stuff. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Not you, Donna, not you.</p>
<p><strong>ed… ed.</strong>: I’ll take over here.</p>
<p><strong>nadine</strong>: You were cutting this deer like a sissy… Sit
down and watch while I do it. AGAIN. THIS YEAR.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Works every year…</p>
<p><strong>sparky</strong>: Sure wouldn’t work at my house. My wife
couldn’t take the wrapper of a twinkie.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Josie, I think we should go public.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That would be wonderful, but it’s only been a
year since Andrew died.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What are you afraid of? What people
think?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t want to offend the customs of your
country.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the
customs of this country. For instance, I don’t eat fish eyes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Fish eyes?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Even if it offended someone, I wouldn’t eat
a fish eye.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why wouldn’t you eat a fish eye, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle.
He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five
minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I
guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he
started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there
was a wind blowing. And he couldn’t swallow and they rushed to him and
loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he
started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and
he still couldn’t get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich
maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency
tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the
fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just
stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar.
And that’s why I don’t ever eat fish eyes.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: We throw away the <em>whole</em> head.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I can’t remember anything about last night.
Is there something I should remember?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No, you should forget about last night.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Laura, I am your friend.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I know you are and you don’t have to do
anything crazy to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You’re not mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night
long. They all knew you at that place.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What can I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: How did the car get back here?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: WE got it back, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: How did I get in the house? How did I get
into my bed?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I can’t help you there.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Was I wearing something of yours and you got
mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: All my things have me in them. I don’t want
you to be like me.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: But I love you, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And I love you, too. But don’t wear my
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Why do you do it, Laura?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Cause I like it.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Excuse me, honey…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad, is the engine on fire? Something is
burning.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: It’s the engine.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: You stole the corn. I had it canned above
the store.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: Miss, the look on her face when it was
opened. There was a closeness. Like the formica table top.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: The thread will be torn, Mr. Palmer, the
thread will be torn.</p>
<p><strong>gerard</strong>: It’s him. It’s your father.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: DAD!… What was that all about? Who was
that?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Mr., Mr., you shouldn’t do that to your
engine. You ought to take it easy, Mr., you’re going to burn your engine
out.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: What the hell was all that? Why doesn’t
someone do something about all of this. My god, that guy came out of
nowhere. He was harassing my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Teresa Banks. You look so much like my
Laura.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: That sounds like fun… Where did you see my
picture?… Okay, come to the Blue Diamond City Motel… Yes, that’s just
your side of Blue Diamond City… I’ll be there. Room one two three…
Right, as in “Get Ready”.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: When’s the next business trip, big
fella?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Soon. How about next time we party with the
girlfriends you told me about?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I can arrange that. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad… Dad… Who was that? How do you know him?
He looked familiar. Have I met him?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: No, you haven’t met him. Have you met
him?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: We’re late to get to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Just sit here for a moment. You seem very
upset.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Guy just pulls up out of the blue… I mean…
what is this world coming to?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Nothing, I chickened out.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Did you come home during the day last
week?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Oh, I thought I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: You know, I did come home, come to think of
it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the
neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house. Where were you,
Laura? I didn’t see you?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I was down the street.</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Hey, Teresa… what?</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: What does Ronette’s father look
like?</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: A short guy… heavy set… balding…</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: What does Laura Palmer’s father look
like?</p>
<p><strong>jacques</strong>: Very handsome… wavy black hair. He looks
like a movie star.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: No, this was a big huge guy. Six four… Nose
broken… like he was a boxer.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: Hey Handsome, this is your little
party girl.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where were you two?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: The guy split.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: The same ring…</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: That’s not important. I will tell you
what is important. The fan will soon be starting.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Who are you? Who are you REALLY?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Don’t forget: It’s Johnny Horne’s birthday
today.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m nearly out.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s taken care of, babe. You and I are going
to make a big score tonight. This will tide you over.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Thank you, Bobby. A big score?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Maybe our biggest. I’ll see you two doors
down from your place at 11:00.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I’ve got to see you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: This afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Okay. Oh god, it’s Johnny Horne’s birthday
today.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What about tonight?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I can’t tonight.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I just can’t, James. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why did we have to have the party here in my
office?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Because Johnny wants it in your office.
What’s so “private” “private” about your office, anyway? Why can’t we
have the party in your precious office?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s a lovely place for a party, Ben. And
look at the new decorations Johnny’s provided.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Don’t you have a picture of Audrey, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Don’t you have a picture of your own
daughter, Ben? Where’s Johnny’s picture? And where’s <em>my</em> picture
I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: At the photographer’s studio getting a gold
frame with floral monograms of your birthday and our wedding vows.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Happy Birthday, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Johnny, Johnny… let your Daddy and your Uncle
and Leland talk. Ben… Leland, we can play the French against the
Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Boating?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Hiking?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Eating?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’d think so.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Sex?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re getting warmer.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Trees?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get
goofy over trees.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: I’ve never heard anything like this before.
The French liking wood anymore than anyone else likes wood. Are you
three crazy?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Sarah’s cousin is French and she can’t stop
talking about the trees around here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: History is on our side, Ben. It’s no accident
that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: They were looking for wood.</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Joey just called in. Bernie, the mule, left
Canada about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Then stop watching Jacques and let’s set a
trap for Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He’s coming in on foot.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: That’s right, Andy. I guess you’re saying
there’s an awful lot of trails for us to cover.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, I was thinking what a long hike Bernie has
to make.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ll get on it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I just wanted to say, “Hello”.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You missed the party. Look at my office. Come
here.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Sure, I’d do a lot more than that for it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ssshhhh, your father’s in the next office. You
should’ve seen him get upset at Johnny’s party about your photo
here.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: He’s always been jealous of you. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: We got to wait till midnight. But I got
plenty here to make it. And I got plenty of dough… right here</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, Pete. Can’t believe your tank’s dry up at
the mill.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No… hell, no. Just got in the truck, started
drivin’, looked down at the gauge and saw a big “E” starin’ at me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know what that Big “E” stands for? Big Ed’s
Gas Farm.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yep. You’re right. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Fill ’er up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I haven’t got it yet.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Nice night.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yep…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I did? I didn’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah… look in here. Look at it from this
angle.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I see it. Hell, it’s on the inside, Pete. The
inside is your territory.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Even this heavy work beats being at home with
the old ball and chain.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Brother, I hear you talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Bobby, I found a leaf.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I shot him. Oh, my god, I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Look at your face.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: This isn’t Mike. Is this Mike?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Bobby… ssshhhh… you killed Mike.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: I want to kill thru you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: I want you to kill <em>for_me</em>.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: No. Never. You’ll have to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>bob’s voice</strong>: I want you to kill <em>for_me</em>.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Babe, I’m on my way out to the woods to divvy
up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box… It’s ten
thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You killed Mike.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’m not going to give you this if you don’t
stop laughing. It’s not one god damn bit funny.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: Laura, you didn’t come and see me today.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I couldn’t it was Johnny Horne’s birthday. I
promised I’d be with him. I told you not to call me here.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: A little trouble with your parents is the
least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up
with.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: Did you make me a tape?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I already made you two tapes.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: Laura, you have to deal with <em>all</em> of
this.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe
I’ll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jacoby</strong>: Send me a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Laura, I would like to talk to you. Is
something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>leland</strong>: Laura. What’s wrong this morning?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I hate asparagus.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sure you do, it’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the
Norwegians.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: If it’s okay with you I’m going to Bobby’s to
do my homework.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s a school night… back by nine.</p>

<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The stuff we got last night.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Baby laxative? We can’t snort baby
laxative.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No shit… We killed a guy for baby
laxative.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: What is the world coming to when you kill a
guy for baby laxative?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t get funny with me again.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I’m not… Bobby I’m gonna need some more

<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: Is it future? Or is it
past?… Do you know who I am?… I am The Arm… And I sound like this…</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Where is the ring?</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: Someone else has it now.</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: That would indicate that it’s the
future.</p>
<p><strong>man from another place</strong>: The later events have never
been kept a secret.</p>
