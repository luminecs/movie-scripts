<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: How do you respond to them?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I say, “Check wif my muver.” After that,

downstairs is vampires so that’s where they should go.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I’m going to the doctor now too. It’s
nice. Miz Rain, she fall out when she finded out that I ain’ been to no

<p><strong>65 continued: 65</strong>: Precious stops to watch two
“society” ladies in hats and gloves push antique buggy style baby
carriages along the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Miz Rain say the longest journey begin wif

talk about how there be all different types of welfare. I want filfy
rich white folks welfare. Mama crazy but Mama not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I am happy to be writing. I am happy to be
in school. I am happy to know my baby coming soon. Don’t see the sense
in pretending I am not pregnant anymore. I am also thinking about lil
Mongo a lot. Miz Rain say we gonna write everyday, that mean home

<p><strong>precious</strong>: And she gonna write back everyday. Thas

<p><strong>precious</strong>: I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls
and then I’d feel right that I have to quit school. I love my baby but
want school too.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Precious, I am glad you love your
baby.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: I think a beautiful young girl like you
should have a chance to get an education. I think your first
responsibility has to be to yourself. You should not drop out of school
…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Come back to class. We miss you. Love, Ms
Rain.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Dear Miz Rain…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Social worker ask me if I want to give
Little Mongo and Abdul up for adoption. I could kill her. She never help
before. Now she want to take my kids away? If she take Abdul, I won’t
have nothing nomore.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Precious, It seems the opposite to
me. If you keep Abdul you might have nothing. You are learning to read
and write, that is everything. Come back to school when you get out of
the hospital. You’re only seventeen. Your whole life is in front of
you.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Dear Miz Rain, Grandmuver come visit and
say only a dog will drop a baby and walk off. Say later not even a
dog.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Precious, You are not a dog. You are
a wonderful young woman who is trying to make something of her life. I
have some questions for you. 1. Where was your grandmother when your
father was abusing you? 2. Where is Little Mongo now? 3. What is going
to be the best thing for you in this situation?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Dear Miz Rain, Lot of questions you ask.
No muver, no grandmuver and father rape me years. Little Mongo wif my
grandmuver. Best for me to stop breaving sometimes I think. I want to be
a good mother too tho.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Dear Precious, Being a good mother
might mean letting your baby be raised by someone who is better able
than you to meet the child’s needs.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Dear Miz Rain, I is best able to meet my
child’s need.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Precious, When you are raising a
small infant you need help. Who is going to help you? How will you
support yourself? How will you keep learning to read and write?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: The welfare help Mama, it help me.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Dear Precious Miss, When you get home from
the hospital, look and see how much welfare has helped your mother.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: You could go further than your mother. You
could get your G.E.D. and go to college. You could do anything Precious
but you have to believe it. Love, Blu Rain.</p>

SOUR-LOOKING WOMAN glaring down at her.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I delivered your last one.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You know I’m sorry to see you back here. I
remembered hoping that you would have learned from your mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Was there something else?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I …No…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Well, I was thinking…</p>

<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Everybody has those Precious.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Ms. Rain, some folks just got it made in
the shade.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: It only looks that way. Yes, I talk to
people all the time for support.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Oh, okay…I didn’t have nobody to really
speak wif for a long time. I know how that be sometimes so thas why I
asked cause almost evrybody need a little help once in a …</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: What on earth are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Well …only that -well, evrybody need a
little help once in a …</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I jus …</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: You just what?!</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I just thought that if you might need some
…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Precious?!</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: You’ve helped me already.</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: 114</strong>: Precious looks both confused and
relieved. Ms. Rain sits while motioning for Precious to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Me? I never…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Last night I had a conversation with my
mother, and that never happens cause our relationship is…. complicated.
We don’t speak, and when we do, it always ends in a fight about my
filthy misguided existence. Most times I feel terrible for days
afterwards wondering whether all the hateful things she said are true.
Those days I just feel like…like…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Nuffin?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: …Yeah. I didn’t feel so bad this time
though. Cause this time I thought about how strong you’ve had to be and
then I decided that I had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother
was wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6 hundred other things. You ask if
you can help me? Baby, you already have.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: …For real?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: That’s the for real, hope to die if I’m
lying truth. Now shouldn’t you be out the door?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I jus help you finish up first. I got some
time.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Some folks got a light around them that
shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel
before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that
was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel,
they still be shining for everybody else. Thas Miz Rain to me.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: In a book I read, a lady escaped to a 1/2
way house. And the lady, she asked the people there just what a 1/2 way
house was. They tole her, you is 1/2 way between the life you had and
the life you want to have …Thas nice. That also mean I can’t stay here
forever and that there is still a ways to go. It be something to get
apartment of my own.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Abdul nine months old and walking! Smart
too. I been reading to him since the day he was born almost. Barely
talkin’ and he countin’ .</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Mama, Daddy, I.S. III and 444 Lenox Avenue
already seem like a past life or some old bad dream. I wish I could have
started out from here but still wif Abdul and poor Mongo.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Come in…</p>
<p><strong>chelsea</strong>: Precious …you have a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Thas Rhonda. She always early.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I should’ve said 4 ’cause then that
way…</p>
<p><strong>chelsea</strong>: It’s not Rhonda.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your daddy dead.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: …Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. Carl …Carl had that AIDS virus.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: … You got it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Got what?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: The AIDS virus.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: How you know?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We never did, you know…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: No, I don’t know Mama.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We never did what you got to do to get it.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: He never been wif you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah…but not like faggots, in the ass and all,
so I know.</p>
<p><strong>120 continued: 120</strong>: Precious sighs.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: You better go to the doctor Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You welcome back home.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I’m home here. I better go see ’bout Abdul
and do homework.</p>
<p><strong>122 continued: 122</strong>: From this distant view, it
appears as if she is almost walking in place.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Rita, what do I mean when the author
describes her protagonist’s circumstances as “unrelenting”?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I don’t know Miz Rain.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: C’mon Rita, think about the question
before you just give up like that…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Precious?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Precious?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Precious, bring your journal to me.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Precious, would you come to my office for
a moment?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Preci-</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Nurse say I am H.I.V. positive.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t have nuffin to write today and I
don’t hate no one. Not even my muhver. My head is all dark inside so I
don’t have nuffin to write today…Maybe nuffin never.</p>
<p><strong>125 continued: 125</strong>: Still trying to stay composed,
Precious wipes her face.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Your baby okay?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Yeah. He good…Won’t bress feed him no more
to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: One time in your journal you told me that
you had never really told your story. write.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: What for? How?! I feel like I am drowning
inside a giant river Miz Rain. Thas what…</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: I think telling your story will get you
over that river Precious …</p>
<p><strong>125 continued: 125</strong>: A moment later, Ms. Rain walks
calmly across the room, retrieves the journal and places it back on top
of Precious’ desk.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Open your notebook Precious.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I’m tired Miz Rain!</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: I know you are but you can’t stop now. You
gotta fight through this. You still have to live your life and do the
best you can with the hand you’ve been dealt. If not for yourself then
for the people who love you.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Nobody love me. Thas a lie.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: People do love you Precious.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Please don’t lie Miz Rain! Love?! Me?!
Love rape me, beat me, call me animal, get me sick and make me feel
wurfless. I had enough love.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: That wasn’t love. There are people in this
room who love you. Your child loves you too. Is that clear Precious? Now
if Rita decided to just give up? Would you let her?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Would you?!</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: And why not?!</p>
<p><strong>125 continued: 125</strong>: Precious doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Because you love her…as much as she loves
you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Now the rest of the world can judge you,
cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we
won’t let you give up and that’s the only thing that matters. Some
people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going.
It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Some things is hard to say and maybe not
your business no way but Rhonda’s brother rape her for years and when
her muhver fine out, she throw Rhonda out her house.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Rita’s daddy kill her muhver in front of
her eyes and Rita been out on the street selling herself since she
12.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Jermaine say mens beat her and then rape
her for what she is. Muhver throw her out the house when she fine out
that she different from other girls.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Miz Rain still a sort of mystery, but a
nice one like the sun.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Miz Rain right too. These girls is my
family now. They visit me at hospital when I had Abdul and even take up
a collection when Mama kick me out. They got love in they eyes and in
they hearts for me, same as I got for them.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: …You know you can use your notebook
between sessions Claireece.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: I mean you can use it specifically for
trying to recover certain early memories.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Tired of this lady asking me questions.
Miz Rain say talk anyway but Miz Weiss just a spy for the State who
write reports on me undercover. Reports go in file. File say what I
could get, where I could go and if I could get cut off and kicked out of
Advancement House.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Oh I doubt that Claireece. It seems like
you’re always thinking about something.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t know. It’s sort of hot in here I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: It is, isn’t it? As a matter of fact, I’m
going to get myself something to drink. Would you like something to
drink Claireece?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: A soda sounds nice …please.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Oh c’mon, you must.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Orange.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Okee Dokee.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Back in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: You know your mother’s been calling here
wanting to come visit.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Would you like her to come to a
counseling session with you?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t know. I never really thought about
it before.</p>
<p><strong>ms. weiss</strong>: Well that’s just one more thing to
consider before I see you next week.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: ’I have just finished a session with
Claireece Precious Jones, an eighteen-year-old African American female.
According to her teachers at Each One Teach One where she attends school
she is a pen-, phen-</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: … ‘phenomenal’</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: …success. Having made strides so
tre-men-tremendous in the past year, she was given the mayor’s award for
outstanding achievement. She seems actively en…engaged in all aspects of
the learning process. However, her TABE test scores are disappointingly
low… ’ Not to Miz Rain! Not to Miz Rain! ‘She scored 2.8 On her last
test.’ So what! Miz Rain-</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: Get a grip and gon’ read the report and
don’t get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say. Anyway, if
your shit wasn’t dope you wouldn’t be standing up here readin’ -what,
what’s her name</p>
<p><strong>132 continued: 132</strong>: Ms. Weiss. What Ms. Weiss got to
say.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: ‘She will need at least an 8.0 Before she
can enter G.E.D. Class and begin work toward her high school
e-q…equivalency.’</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: …Nice.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Thanks. ’Abdul is the client’s second-born
child. He’s from all outwhere…</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: ‘outward’…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: ’Appearances, a healthy and welladjusted
toddler. Precious attends to his needs a-s-s-i-d-u-o-s-l-y…</p>
<p><strong>precious &amp; jermaine</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: … ‘and with great affection and ee…’</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: ‘eagerly’</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: … ‘seeks any and all information on child
rearing. The time and resources it would require for this young woman to
get a G.E.D. or into college would be considerable’…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Finish reading this …I know what’s
coming.</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: ‘Although she is in school now, it is not
a job readiness program. Nonetheless, Claireece is capable of going to
work. In January, her son will be two years old. In keeping with the new
initiative on welfare reform, I feel Claireece would benefit from any of
the various workfare programs in existence. Despite her obvious
intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home
attendant.’</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t want to be no motherfucking home
attendant! I wanna be…</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: Hush! ‘My rapp-o-r-t with Precious is
minimal. Although I am not sure with whom, she evidently has access to
counseling services provided by Each One Teach One. She has a history of
sexual abuse and is H.I.V. positive.’</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: She say she not put that in my file!
Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: That’s the bitch’s job, to get the
mofuckin’ goods on you! ‘The client seems to view the social services,
AFDC, as taking care of her forever.’</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: That file do show one thing -that</p>
<p><strong>132 continued: 132</strong>: this hoe don’t know nuffin wurf
knowing about Claireece Precious Jones.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I’m getting my G.E.D., a job, and a place
for me and Abdul, then I go to college. I don’t want to ‘home attend’
nobody!</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: You better put this shit back before you
get in trouble. We talk about it with Ms. Rain in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s</strong>: And don’t be coming back late for his bad
ass neither.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Miz Weiss just part of the gang but
definitely not cool. And social worker look at me like I am ugly freak
who did something to make my own life like it is. I guess I am trying to
figure out just what has happened to me while Miz Weiss just hell bent
on making me go wipe old people’s asses.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Got to sort dis out quick tho ’fore
Abdul’s next birthday -coming up fast.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Time is up. Does anyone want to share?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Okay Precious.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: I don’t really want to read all I wrote, I
jus’ wanna kinda say what it is I’m writing about and how it came
about.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Well, to make a long story short, the
counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc.,
etc. But it’s really about workfare. She want to send me out as home
attendant.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: How you know?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Cause I stole my file from Advancement
House and read it.</p>
<p><strong>jo ann</strong>: Next time get mine’s too.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: All this ‘What you wanna be?’ And ‘You can
talk to me.’ They ain’ no motherfucking therapists on our side, they
just flunkies for the ’fare. I wanna work, but not for no motherfucking
welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who
really got jobs cleaning up ’cause I’m there working for free.</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: And what kinda shit is it for someone like
Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D. to work at some
live-in job for some old-ass crackers. She’ll never make a rise she get
stuck in some shit like that!</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your
language. Both of you. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: Now I see your points, but is
stealing…</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Miz Rain, If I didn’t steal that file I
wouldn’t know what I was facing!</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: You read the whole thing by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Yeah…basically.</p>
<p><strong>jo ann</strong>: Rhonda home attend. Say old bitch would ring
a bell when she want Rhonda in the night!</p>
<p><strong>jermaine</strong>: Rhonda used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach where she work for them people.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: The people had her there all day and night
- ‘on call’ they call it. But you only get pay for 8 hours so that’s 8 X
$6.37 = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause
you is working more than eight hours a day. You is working 24 hours a
day and 50.96 divided by 24 is…</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: $2.12 by my count.</p>
<p><strong>jo ann</strong>: Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a
actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night!</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Home attendants usually work six days a
week. I would only see Abdul on Sundays? When would I go to school? Am I
gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was?</p>
<p><strong>ms. rain</strong>: No! So stop worrying about it. We’ll cross
that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern
now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you’re working with and can’t
trust, she’s out! We gotta find somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>precious</strong>: Well, I just write in my notebook till I
get wif some kinda therapist I can trust. Actually that always help me
more than talking to her. Plus, I’m going to start going to meetings wif
Rita for insect survivors.</p>

is like a roach or bugs.</p>
