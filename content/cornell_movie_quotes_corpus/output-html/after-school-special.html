<p><strong>final shooting script</strong>: December 21, 2001</p>
<p><strong>1 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 1</strong>:
As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American high
school…</p>
<p><strong>1a another corridor 1a</strong>: …we hear all the sounds of a
STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to
the cheesy music.</p>
<p><strong>1b int. william wall high school - auditorium - day
1b</strong>: The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
from an open door…</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: This is unwatchable. It’s not even in focus.
And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy
work.</p>
<p><strong>1c int. william wall high school - a/v room - day
1c</strong>: The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV
MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy’s ugly face.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Why do they always show the guy’s face? It’s
like, can’t we just assume he’s enjoying it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Because they’re trying to make us feel like
we’re better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks
as hot as her.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: How the hell do you know?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a basic rule of porno.</p>
<p><strong>2 int. william wall high school - a/v room - day 2</strong>:
… before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear
the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps
to conceal any possible bonerage.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It all started on my seventeenth birthday
with our usual morning routine: film appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Deacon! What are you doing? I was watching
that.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Come on, let’s go. We’re going to be
late.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And when I say film appreciation, I mean
film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and I sell
them.</p>
<p><strong>3 int. william wall high school - cafeteria - day 3</strong>:
The guys are waiting in line for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Fred’s the kind of kid who’s basically given
up on high school. He figures his glory days are way ahead of him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then
when I’m making a hundred grand a year, I’ll have a whole stable of hot
chicks sitting around topless on my yacht.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Will that work?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You are a complete moron.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>4 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 4</strong>:
The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image that reads
“Fifteen Days Till Midterms.” Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking
towards him.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Until that big payday, Fred’s sex life
consists of spanking it.</p>
<p><strong>amazing girl</strong>: That test was sooo hard.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. boys’ bathroom - day 5</strong>: Fred looks under the
stalls to make sure no one’s in there, then enters a stall and locks the
door. He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the toilet
seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet paper off the roll.
Then, from out of the book bag, Fred pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand
lotion. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 6</strong>:
Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a stain off
of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: We’re going to be late. Are you
coming?</p>
<p><strong>7 int. boys’ bathroom - day 7</strong>: Fred walks into the
stall and grabs the toilet protector.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Fred averages two to five time a day,
depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 8</strong>:
Matt is videotaping the students running down the hallway to class. Fred
watches.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Now Matt– Matt’s what you’d call a late
bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and
complete dork.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: All great directors start this way. I’m
documenting the essence of high school. Teenagers running to meet their
destiny only to find it’s just home room. It’s very existential.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So’s my balls. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>10 int. outside the locker rooms - day 10</strong>: Matt
trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to his bloody
nose.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: In the normal course of things, Matt
probably wouldn’t even have been our friend, but Fred likes having
someone to boss around, and I think Matt’s actually pretty cool once you
get to know him.</p>
<p><strong>10a matt’s pov 10a</strong>: The proverbial jackpot. Teenage
girls changing. Bras. Panties. Towels…</p>
<p><strong>10b reverse angle 10b</strong>: Matt’s eyes widen. And then,
they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly scurries away.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Well, at least he’s got the key to the A/V
room.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 11</strong>:
Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is
grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dorky freshman</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: People always talk about how tough it is
being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about
bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s really hard. Being a
seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it’s like to have only one thing on
your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting
it.</p>
<p><strong>12 int. biology class - day 12</strong>: CLOSE ON a textbook
showing the anatomy of the vagina. PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly
staring into space, but really staring at…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Testosterone is a drug more powerful than
heroin. I don’t really have any evidence to support that, but the point
is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of
sex.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: … the increase in the hormone
testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent
male…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We’re suffering. Suffering from a deep,
debilitating addiction to something we’ve never even had. Teenage boys
are like time bombs, ready to explode.</p>
<p><strong>behind deacon</strong>: Two GUYS are whispering.</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: Did you hear about Rachael?</p>
<p><strong>guy 2</strong>: No, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: John Baldwin nailed her.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Are you talking about Rachael Unger?</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt’s party.
In the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. deacon’s bedroom - day 13</strong>: RACHAEL UNGER,
Deacon’s girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon’s sheets after
school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately
surprised by her state of undress.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Rachael! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: We’ve been together for a year now, and I
thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: You’ve been talking about this for
months.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I didn’t think you were listening to me.</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Don’t you want to?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Of course I do. But, I, um… I don’t have
anything…</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Deacon, what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I have a math test tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>14 int. biology class - day 14</strong>: The Teacher CLEARS
HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He turns away from the guys
behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: “I have a math test tomorrow.” The bottom
line is, I just couldn’t do it. I don’t know why, I just couldn’t. And
I’ve cursed myself every day since then.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. william wall high school - hallway - day 15</strong>:
… very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared
to how he feels when he looks</p>
<p><strong>down the hallway</strong>: and sees Rachael at her locker,
hugging some people good-bye . Rachael looks down the hallway towards
Deacon, but Deacon ducks away. Now he’s even more embittered.</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. william wall high school - parking lot - day
16</strong>: Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after
school.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Did you videotape it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You are the biggest moron I have ever
known.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, guys. Here’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with John
Baldwin.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, you had your chance. I told you to seal
that deal.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Shut up, Fabio. I don’t see you sealing any
deals.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m biding my time.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Whatever. It just wasn’t good timing.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It doesn’t get any better than that. You and
Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don’t just appear
out of thin air. “I have a math test tomorrow.”</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Will you shut up already? Look, I’ve been
thinking about this all day. We’re juniors now. Upperclassmen.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: So we have a responsibility to ourselves to
start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. There’s
nothing holding us back any more.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You see? That’s exactly what I’m talking
about. That could be us.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s not going to be us this year, or next
year, or any year, ever.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Why not? All we have to do is follow the
simple lessons of Tony Montana in “Scar Face.”</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ooh. Good movie.</p>
<p><strong>deacon and matt</strong>: “First you get the money, then you
get the power, then you get the women.”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So, we’re going to become Cuban drug
lords?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Listen, the porno pirating operation is
bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my
birthday, we’ll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there’s
nothing stopping us from getting the girls.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Bye, Sphincter!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Nothing’s going to change, Deacon. You’re
still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one
will ever let you forget it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I had a stomach virus, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, that’s just not fair.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. video casa del russ a.k.a. russ’s video magic - day
18</strong>: Fred arrives dressed for work and waves to RUSS, the
scraggly owner of this small video rental store. Fred passes J.T., Mark,
Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other CUSTOMERS on his way to the back
section of the store.</p>
<p><strong>adult section</strong>: Fred makes sure Russ isn’t looking
and ducks into the porno section. Hurriedly, he pulls out “Half-Cyborg
5: Final Showdown” from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape
for “Dirty Darla #7.” He makes the switch. Fred sighs a breath of
relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult section…</p>
<p><strong>main area</strong>: …right into…</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: I’ve been watching you.</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: Those movies aren’t for little monkey-
boys!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: Come back here, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: What else you got in here?</p>
<p><strong>russ</strong>: What’s this for?</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: I’m Candy. Let’s play dress-up.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. suburban street - day 19</strong>: Deacon drives the
DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of the DMV TESTER.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And I signal exactly two hundred feet before
the turn. Rule 108-1.</p>
<p><strong>dmv tester</strong>: Great. Now after the right, I want you
to parallel park in the open space.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I begin the parallel parking maneuver by
pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into
reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise…</p>
<p><strong>flash!</strong>: Deacon’s picture is taken. He passed.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. deacon’s house - day 22</strong>: It’s dark, but
suddenly the lights come on.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Wow. This is great.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Were you surprised?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Really. I was.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Happy birthday, Deacon. It’s Lois Lane #2. Be
careful. It’s still in the wrapper.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. deacon’s house - later 23</strong>: Half-eaten cake
and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt videotapes the event.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Are you ready for the big present?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You mean there’s more?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: It’s in the garage. Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. deacon’s house - garage - day 24</strong>: The door
opens, the lights come on, and Deacon’s face drops. No new car. Instead,
several large wrapped boxes. Deacon halfheartedly rips open the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: It’s a new computer system. You’ve been
talking about it for months.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: What? That’s not what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, it is. It’s just–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Max!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: We can exchange it if it’s not the right
one.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, I just thought– I thought you guys were
buying me that car I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: A car? Why do you need a car?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: You can ask permission to use our car
whenever you want, champ.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: I told you he didn’t want a new
computer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Like you know what anyone in this house
really wants.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. deacon’s bedroom - night 25</strong>: The guys set up
the computer. Deacon is really depressed.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Now what are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: At least you got this great party.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Actually, we were expecting a lot more
people.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You invited more people?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, we did send out flyers to like three
hundred people from school.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And no one showed up?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Uh, guys. No one showed up because they’re
all at Tom Cooperman’s house. He’s having a keg party.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What? Why didn’t I hear about this? That
shit’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the 411
in study hall.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in
third grade, and I swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing that
I ask for on my goddamn birthday?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fine. Watch your balls.</p>
<p><strong>25b int. coop’s house - night 25b</strong>: CLOSE ON a set of
feet, stomping on a Sony D.D.R. mat. REVEAL TOM COOPERMAN dancing up a
storm, in a heated competition against several challengers. The CROWD
goes wild at Coop’s moves. The DOORBELL RINGS. Continuing his dance
steps, Coop moves to the door.</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. coop’s house - front door - night 26</strong>:
Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting. The door opens, and
we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Grommets!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, Coop. Can we come in?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Sorry, son, that dog won’t hunt. Y’all ain’t
on the list.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Coop. It’s my birthday today, so cut me some
slack, all right?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Well, pickle my turnips, why didn’t you say
so? Happy birthday, friend.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Little help?</p>
<p><strong>27 int. coop’s house - night 27</strong>: People drinking,
dancing, couples making out. Girls everywhere. And over near the keg
is…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh, my God. There’s Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: She looks good.</p>
<p><strong>deacon and fred</strong>: are zombies, completely mesmerized
by her.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: She spilled her beer.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’m gonna go talk to her. What have I got to
lose?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Your dignity?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: She’s Rachael’s friend. It’s not like I
don’t know her.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls
like that.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Happy Birthday, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You remembered.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Well, I got this flyer and–</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh, right. So where’s Jake?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Like I care.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: So you two aren’t going out any more?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Freakin!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He shoots, he misses, right, ass- sphincter?
Come on, Naomi. We’re going in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Screw off. I’m talking to Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. coop’s house - back yard - later 28</strong>: Deacon
wanders out back. It’s very dark and there are several people in the
pool, including Jake’s good-looking friends, Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and
MARK. It’s hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they might
not be wearing any clothes. Deacon sees this and starts to walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: Deacon. I heard it was your birthday. Come on
in the pool, man.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: No, seriously. It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Come on, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Yeah. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Dude, what are you doing? Take off your
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We’re skinny dipping, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh. Okay. Sorry, I’ll just leave you guys
alone then–</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: –No, come on in. Join us.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: looks at her, thinks it over, and finally…
slips off his shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Wow. This feels amazing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Coop’s doing funnels. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: Sorry, dude.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, give me back my clothes!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Freakin? I can’t see you. Maybe I need to turn
on the LIGHTS.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did you really think Naomi was into you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon shit
his pants again!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, I didn’t! Give them back!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sphincter boy shit his pants!</p>
<p><strong>28a int. coop’s house - night 28a</strong>: Jake locks the
sliding glass door and waves at Deacon in the pool. The group laughs and
walks away.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. coop’s house - back yard - later 29</strong>: Deacon
is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled. Finally, the lights turn
off in the back yard, and Deacon ventures out of the pool. He grabs an
inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around his privates. He slowly
sneaks around the house.</p>
<p><strong>29a ext. coop’s house - side of the house - night
29a</strong>: A dog BARKS! He snarls at Deacon standing there wearing
only the pool toy. Deacon runs away into the</p>
<p><strong>29b ext. coop’s house - driveway - night 29b</strong>: The
Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, watch the nads!</p>
<p><strong>coop’s dad</strong>: What the hell kind of sick shit is
this?</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. william wall high school - parking lot - day
30</strong>: The next day, the guys are at the bike rack, when a hot
SPORTS CAR drives by. Deacon is visibly bummed.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You know how long it’s going to take to save
up for a car selling porno tapes twenty bucks a pop?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: There’s a small problem.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and went
berserk. Some sort of sting operation he’s been planning for months. I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You’re kidding me, right? Tell me you’re
kidding.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No. And now I have to work twice a week at my
dad’s office. I told you this Scarface plan was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Great. So now we’ve got no girls, no car,
and no money.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And no porn.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Tony Montana would be very disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. biology class - day 31</strong>: … very depressed, as
he sits, bored out of his mind in his biology class.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: Now turn your textbooks to chapter
six, the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by now, biology is the study
of life, in all its infinite varieties.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: So to keep things a little fun
around here, tomorrow we’re taking a field trip to the zoo.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. william wall high school - parking lot - day
32</strong>: Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike
rack.</p>
<p><strong>dorky freshman</strong>: Is this some kind of extortion
racket? I’ll pay you double if you can get me something today.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’m sorry. There’s nothing we can do for a
while. We don’t have anything new.</p>
<p><strong>dorky freshman</strong>: I’m dying. I just need
something.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Going home to cram for midterms.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed
any help.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: That’s okay. I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: So where did Rachael go off to?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: She went to Paris with the French Club.
We’re seeing other people.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, sphincter.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Look, can you please stop calling me that? I
think we’re old enough to just let it go. All right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, sure. Sorry about that… Shit-pants.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi, Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oops. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>33 int. aerostar - day 33</strong>: … pissed. His crushed
bike is in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Look, mom. I need a car.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: But I thought we agreed–</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I need a car of my own.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Well, honey. A car is a lot of
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Jesus, Mom. I’m seventeen now. I think I can
handle it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Well, it’s also a lot of money. I’ll
tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a
car. I’ll talk to your father.</p>

<p><strong>fred</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Your dad really knows his firewalls.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, asshole. Don’t just come barging in here.
We could have been naked.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Shut up. I figured out how to get back on
the Tony Montana track…. So, I’m at the zoo today…</p>
<p><strong>36 ext. zoo - day 36</strong>: A crowd of people are watching
something in the monkey cage.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: People! People! Come quickly.
Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And these monkeys are doing it. I mean,
they’re going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: With one final thrust of his
engorged penis, the male deposits his seed and moves on. Probably to a
younger, more desirable female. One who doesn’t have any “issues.”
Whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: That’s when it hit me.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: A little help!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Well, Roger actually…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Let’s make one.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: One what?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: A movie.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Great! That’s perfect! I’ve already got an
idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing. It’s like “The Shining” meets
“The Jetsons.”</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, you moron. A porno film.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Even better.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And check this out. The best part of all, is
I’ve got an angle.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What kind of angle?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We can make pornos that cater to guys like
us.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You mean virgins.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yes. Adult films made by virgins for
virgins.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: With good cinematography.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And cute, nice girls. The kind you’d want to
take to dinner with your parents.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Right. No shots of sweaty guys’ faces.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And nothing up the butt.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What? I don’t like it when they put stuff up
their butt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: These have to be nicely edited. We should
shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, Matt. We’ll shoot it on your video
camera. We’re not getting any expensive equipment.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How are we going to get the women to star in
the film?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And the guys.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t know. We’ll surf the net. We’ll
figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That was really funny.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’m serious about this.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We can’t make a porno movie.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Do you have any idea how much trouble we’d get
in?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Do you have any idea how much money we’d
make?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Like how much?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Enough for a car. Enough for more camera
shit. To take girls out. I don’t know. For whatever we want.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What about the moral implications?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It’s a free market transaction between
consenting adults. What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’re not adults.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He’s got a point, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Guys, tell me the truth. Haven’t you ever
wondered… haven’t you ever imagined what it would be like to make
one?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay. Sure. I’ve thought about it. I’ve
thought about shaving Principal Taggert’s ass, too.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn’t
let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our
lives. We’ll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we’ll have the
money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it
safe. Well, I’m not going to waste another minute. I’m making this porno
movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of
wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds,
I’ll just have to tell you, “Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew
it.”</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That was a really good speech, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Did you work that out before?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay… So say we were to do this. What would we
call our company?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’ve got it. “After School Special.”</p>
<p><strong>38 int. office building - day 38</strong>: WE FOLLOW a WOMAN
dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type outfit, walking down the
hallway past office suites; a mortgage company, a dentist, etc… She
enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE the sign on the
door, “Ramalot Productions.”</p>
<p><strong>39 int. vic’s “studio” - continuous 39</strong>: A small,
vertically integrated porno production company. Blow-ups of the
company’s box covers on the walls, hundreds of copies of titles on
shelves, a small STAFF and two adjoining rooms. VIC RAMALOT, whose face
we recognize from Dirty Darla #7, enters from the set. His partner,
MIKE, helps him on with his robe.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That was good. Some good action.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: I’ve got a question for you Mike, and I want
you to promise to be completely honest.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sure. Of course, Vic.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Do you think I’m too fat?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Are you kidding? The camera loves you.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number eight?</p>
<p><strong>darla</strong>: Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Is he in there?</p>
<p><strong>40 int. conference room - continuous 40</strong>: where
there’s a terribly FRIGHTENED MAN tied to a chair with a gag in his
mouth. Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge clippers
from the table. He snaps them open.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: So, you think you can just walk into my town
and move in on my territory?</p>
<p><strong>41 int. doctor’s office - day 41</strong>: The guys are
huddled behind the frosted window of Fred’s dad’s office, standing away
from the RECEPTIONIST.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’ve got to have two forms of i.d. to prove
she’s over eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: How much money do we need?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: A first time porno actress makes only two
fifty to five hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That’s it? Does that include the sex?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yes, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So how do we get women for this movie?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for
“body models.” That’s like some sort of code word in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Are we supposed to have sex with these
women?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Fred, your father wants you to take these
urine samples down to the lab.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay. In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We also need an adult signature to set up the
bank account and the web site.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Let’s use Principal Taggert’s name.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh yeah, good idea. That’ll never come back to
haunt us.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Then whose name should we use?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: I’m Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00
appointment.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I’ll let the
doctor know you’re here for your… rectal exam. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why not? It’s perfect. My dad’s got
Mr. Greitzer’s signature on file, his credit card number, and his social
security number…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And he’ll never find out?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s not like we’re going to send him our
annual report. It’ll just be like an official name of record or
something.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: And take these fecal and semen samples,
too.</p>
<p><strong>41a ext. street - day 41a</strong>: The guys ride their bikes
towards the lab to deliver the samples.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And we need porno names.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a basic rule of porno. All people
affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so
their friends don’t recognize them.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, you mean like “Johnny Hardmember”?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Exactly. That’s a good one. I’ll be Balls
McLongcock.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ooh, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Guys. Those kind of names are just for the
actors.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’re just jealous that you don’t have a cool
porno name like us.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay, fine. Then I’m Sam … Slam. Sam Slam.
The Back Door Man.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That name sucks.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You don’t get it, do you? A porno name needs
to be a very subtle thing.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Sorry, Balls. I guess I’m still new at
this.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Matt, pick that up.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. deacon’s house - kitchen - night 42</strong>: The
family dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: And I’m telling the guy, he’s got to use
form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary, but Johnson’s gotta be the big
man. “We’ve been using ND-90 for twenty-two years.” But Johnson’s an
idiot. He doesn’t know ND-90 doesn’t even exist anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Hello? Deacon, it’s for you. It’s a
young lady named Palomina.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. 345 Remson. That’s right. Great.
Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward to working with you, too.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’m tutoring someone … in math. To earn
money for a car.</p>
<p><strong>43 int. deacon’s bedroom - day 43</strong>: The guys are busy
setting up auditions.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, we don’t pay bus fare.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Sure, you can bring your dog. Oh. No, that’s
okay. Better leave him home.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Thanks. You sound sexy, too.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut to:</strong>: The guys are getting excited.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I can’t believe this is working.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. basement set - other room - day 44</strong>: And
there’s Matt, wearing a shirt and tie, nervously sitting in the rec room
with a room full of CRACK WHORES. They’re a motley crew of fat, old,
toothless, spandex-wearing streetwalkers . An uncomfortable silence
pervades the room. Matt turns to one woman wearing a rainbow-colored
halter top.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: When you have sex with a strange man, do you
imagine it’s like your boyfriend or something?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We’re ready. Over.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Roger. Over.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You can go in now.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. deacon’s basement - day 45</strong>: The basement is
set up with a casting couch. Fred and Deacon are also dressed in jackets
and ties. The Crack Whore makes her way over to them. They stare at her,
slackjawed.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Take a seat please.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hi, I’m Balls McLongcock and this is Sam
Slam.</p>
<p><strong>crack whore</strong>: Tequila. You boys seem kind of
young.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Don’t worry. We’re old enough.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any
films before?</p>
<p><strong>crack whore</strong>: I been in some home movies. Stuff like
that. Some pictures.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay, then. I think we have what we need.
We’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>crack whore</strong>: So you don’t want me to suck you two
off?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, I don’t think that will be necessary at
this time.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. deacon’s basement - later 46</strong>: The whores are
gone.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Maybe if we put another ad in and say we’re
only looking for good looking models.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: There’s got to be another way to recruit porno
actresses.</p>
<p><strong>flash!</strong>: Three digital images of the guys are lined
up on Deacon’s computer monitor . Deacon is digitally altering the photo
of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt’s photo has already gotten mutton
chops and Deacon’s looking sweet with a fu-manchu.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I say we make them from Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Hawaii?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It’s perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii
driver’s license looks like?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But isn’t it going to seem a little
suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation in
Hawaii, where do you think people from Hawaii go?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aloha.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. deacon’s house - family room - night 48</strong>: The
next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in Hawaiian shirts.
Deacon’s parents are reading and Max is watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: I have to go to the video store
later.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: But, mom. You said I could use the car, but
it’s never free.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: All right, Deacon. I’ll walk to the
store.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where are you guys going?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, for ass-wranglers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Max!</p>
<p><strong>49 int. aerostar - night 49</strong>: Inside the car , the
three guys apply their fake facial hair to match their three new fake
i.d.’s.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are we really going to do this?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>49a ext. cleveland - night 49a</strong>: The minivan descends
out of the suburbs into the lights of the big city below.</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. the pretty kitty club - night 50</strong>: CLOSE ON
the Aerostar’s bumper sticker: “My child is on the honor roll at William
Wall High School.”</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I.d.’s.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What
brings you guys to Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>fred matt</strong>: Business. Vacation.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We’re on business, he’s on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Well, “tiki-alohi-noa-lohi.”</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: That’s Hawaiian for “welcome.”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii a
few months ago. Haven’t picked up the local lingo yet.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Okay. Have a good time, guys.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Oh, and guys. Nice lamination job.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Look. We have to get into this strip
bar.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: The next two years of high school depend on
it.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: How old are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Sorry, guys.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We’ve got money.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. the pretty kitty club - night 51</strong>: WE TRACK
the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor towards the light.
Each guy is in his own little world, Matt and Fred following Deacon as
he takes the first nervous steps. First the neon lights hit them, then
the smell of liquor and sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and
finally the grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them
in their tracks. Their eyes bug out. SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by.
As they move further into the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting
lap dances and some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear. The
guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only by the voice of
a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.</p>
<p><strong>cocktail waitress</strong>: What’ll you boys have? Two drink
minimum.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Huh? Oh. I’ll have a scotch. Straight up. On
the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’ll have a seven and seven.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Uh, same.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What’s a seven and seven?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I don’t know. But I heard that guy over there
order one and I like the way it sounds. Numerical.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: To After School Special.</p>
<p><strong>matt and fred</strong>: To After School Special.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It tastes like poison.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: Are you boys interested in a
dance?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>in silhouette</strong>: She strips off her top revealing her
big American breasts. She rubs up and down Fred’s body, shaking her hair
in his face. Matt and Deacon watch intently.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: You want another dance?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to go to
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: Well how about you buy me a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: Seven and seven.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You want mine?</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: So what brings you boys to
the Pretty Kitty?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’re from Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Actually, we’re filmmakers. We’re here
looking for new talent.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah, we’re looking for some beautiful
ladies looking to break into film. You interested?</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>american flag stripper</strong>: But I know someone who
is.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Hi, I’m Ashley. You guys are filmmakers?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Video actually. They won’t let me shoot on
film.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Look. We’re paying top dollar, hetero only,
no anal, and we’re distributing through our web site.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Aren’t you kind of young?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Aren’t you? You know we’re going to need two
forms of i.d. to prove you’re over eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I’m eighteen. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Then you’re hired.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Shouldn’t we audition her first?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Don’t worry. You guys relax and have a few
drinks. By the time the night’s over, you’ll know I’m your girl.</p>
<p><strong>51a int. the pretty kitty club - night 51a</strong>: - Ashley
slinks through the fog onstage and works the pole like good girl should:
gentle but firm. - Various other Strippers the American Flag Stripper, a
BLACK STRIPPER, and an EXOTIC give the three guys lap dances, dance on
the carousel, and generally suck up to them. - The guys are pounding
drinks like there’s no tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>51b ext. amusement park - night 51b</strong>: - CLOSE ON a
trashcan, the guys are throwing up. PULL BACK TO</p>
<p><strong>reveal:</strong>: - Boot and rally. The guys wipe their faces
and join a gaggle of Strippers heading into an Amusement Park.</p>
<p><strong>51c ext. amusement park - various booths - night

<p><strong>52 int. vic’s “studio” - day 52</strong>: A LADY dressed in
sexy clothes and eating chicken wings from a huge bucket is waiting
around on the set, but Vic is over talking to Mike.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Someone’s been recruiting new talent.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Jimmy Rimmer says they’re from Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Why the hell would someone from Hawaii come to
Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Vacation? There’s the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: What is this? “F” with Vic month? If any more
amateurs start moving in on my territory, I’m going to get really
mad.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Who you gonna shoot?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Calm down, Vic. I don’t need you all agitated.
You still got five films to star in today.</p>

<p><strong>53 int. deacon’s bedroom - day 53</strong>: Deacon wakes up
sick as a dog. All the shades are drawn, but Fred and Matt are already
hard at work on the computer. They seem completely fine, with no signs
of Deacon’s hangover.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What are you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We came up with a great idea. We’re going to
presell the videos by posting the scripts on the website.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Will that work?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I don’t know. But it’s kind of fun. We just
wrote this whole thing about the girls’ locker room.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: One thing, though. If our motto is “by
virgins, for virgins,” I was thinking we should put a picture of one of
us on the web site to sort of sell the image.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’re not putting my picture up there.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It doesn’t really have to be one of us,
though, does it?</p>
<p><strong>insert:</strong>: ROGER’S FACE, as Balls McLongcock, proudly
displayed on the web site, hawking the first feature film of After
School Special with the motto, “By Virgins, For Virgins.” A quick knock
on the door and Deacon’s Mom comes in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Deacon, look who’s here. Your friend,
Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You kids have fun.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the hell’s going on, Sphincter?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I saw the strippers. And some crack whore
named Saffron came over my house the other day looking for you guys.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s this? “Oh, my God. There’s a boy at the
door looking at us naked in the shower.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: “The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of their
glistening bodies. ‘I’m so dirty,’ she moans.” What the hell kind of
crap is this? Are you guys running a whorehouse or something?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: They’re not whores if we film them, you
moron.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You retards are making a porno movie?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You can’t prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: A stripper. Her name’s Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s the guy?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, maybe I could do it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, that’s not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a lot harder than it looks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t think I can do it? Trust me, I’ve
nailed enough girls.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look, you little butt munch. I want to do
this, and if you don’t let me, I’ll go and tell your mommy what kind of
sick shit you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>darkness.</strong>: Click. The lights come on. The big day
has come at last. The guys are nervously conferring on one side of the
room, far away from Ashley, who’s standing alone, dressed in a
conservative high school girl’s outfit. The basement has been
transformed into the guys’ idea of a movie set, complete with lights,
camera, tripod, and sound equipment. A desk and decoration make the room
look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. Deacon gives Matt a
little shove, and Matt takes a long walk over to Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So, um, I’ll be directing.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay. So I want you to play this very
understated. It’s a very visceral scene, so it’s important not to play
it too over the top.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Uh huh. Hey, did you guys shave or
something?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. I think we’re ready here.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Boom in position.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ashley, get into position.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are we actually going to do this?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So, um, we’re starting with the masturbation
and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And … action.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are
making me so hot. I can’t help myself.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: FRED smiles ear to ear. DEACON gulps.
MATT peers out from behind the camera.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I hope no one catches me because I forgot to
lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Close up.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Close up.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>54a through matt’s video display 54a</strong>: We’d love to
get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it’s just a BLUR.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, CUT!</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: What? Did I so something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Uh, no. You were great. I think I’ve got what
I need there. I want to set up for Jake.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I need a bathroom break.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Not now, Fred. Jake.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Action.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, my God. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I couldn’t help myself. Please don’t tell
the principal.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let’s get to the,
uh, sexual material.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Jake, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sure. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And ACTION!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Action, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Come on, Jake. We’re filming.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All right. Hang on a second.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: My arm’s getting tired.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: So’s his.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Action…</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, it’s not hard yet.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him
out.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Aaaahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Wait! I’m not set up for that shot!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Can I put down the boom?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Jake? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This has never happened before. She got me too
excited.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Me? How did you … without even getting hard
first?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you want to hear? I’ve got a tiny
pee-pee? I’m a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner?
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene
again. Just relax. We can splice it together.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’d have to do it like twenty times to get
enough footage.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m out of here. And if you dickwads tell
anybody about this, first I’ll kill you, and then I’ll bust you
guys.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Deacon. You do it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come on. This is your big chance.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No. You do it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I have to run the camera.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, like you’re the only one who can do
that.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Fine. I’ll do it. I’ll do it for the sake of
the film. Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Matt. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Matt!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley
and chalk this up to a failed experiment.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No. We can get someone else.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who?</p>

<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Yeah. Thanks. I’m so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Really? I didn’t think you got embarrassed

asshole.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: When we were going out, he was so mean to me
all the time. I think he’s compensating for his little dick that never
even gets hard.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Well at least you were smart enough to dump
him. I mean, you deserve someone who will treat you … I don’t know.
Really well.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You know what you are?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You’re a nice guy.</p>

<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey, where’s Coop?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He was supposed to be here a half hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Maybe he got sucked into a black hole.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Good one, Spock. I can’t understand why
you’re not more popular with the ladies.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Look, we’re wasting time. Deacon, why don’t
you just go in there?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. Okay. All right already.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And action!</p>

way…</p>

<p><strong>fred</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah, it’ll be a great shot.</p>

<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Because that’s what guys do in gay porn.</p>

making out with Fred.</p>

Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No way. I’m holding the mike and that’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: I thought we were doing straight porn.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: If you guys want to do gay porn, you still
have to pay me.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid
dream I had.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You dreamed about making out with Fred?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex
with you. But it was just a dream so let’s forget it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What’s with the light?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s a “special effect.” If you want this film
to look amateurish, you’re going to have to get someone else to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Come on. Let’s do it already.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Action.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: This summer tent-pole event-movie is making
me so scared.</p>

<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Not yet. This is the really scary part.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hey. Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Do you ever think maybe we’ve gotten
ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Oh, baby. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Unplug the light!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Wait, it’s hot!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Quick, get the fire extinguisher!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Over there!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It’s not working!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the
foamy cat fight script last week.</p>
<p><strong>71 int. fred’s bedroom - night 71</strong>: Matt and Fred are

<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>deacon’s parents</strong>: are standing in the doorway to the
kitchen with Max, whose arm is in a splint. Max stares at Ashley. She
covers herself some more. Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nice rack.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Mom! Dad! What are you doing home?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Max sprained his wrist at soccer
practice. What is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Well, I’m sure there’s a reasonable
explanation why there’s a naked girl in our kitchen. Right, Deacon?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I’m Deacon’s girlfriend. Ashley.</p>

<p><strong>coop</strong>: Yeah. My date wasn’t feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mine has mono. From too much making out. With
me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped over
a candle. It was to set the right mood.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: A fire? Let me see the damage.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Dad, don’t. Let me take responsibility.
We’ll pay to have it fixed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Damn right you will.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Well, Ashley. I didn’t know Deacon even
had a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Maybe you can join us for dinner
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I think Ashley’s busy tonight–</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. deacon’s house - kitchen - night 74</strong>: Ashley
is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring at her. Mr. Lewis
steals a few glances of Ashley himself while continuing his work-related
rant.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: So get this. Johnson comes up to me today
and he’s all like “where’s the ND-90’s?” I’m like, “Johnson, they
discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago.” I’ve been telling this
guy…</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Johnson sounds like a moron.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: So, Ashley. If I could ask you a
personal question, exactly how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Isn’t that funny?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>foyer</strong>: Deacon open the door. It’s Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I thought I’d come by and surprise you. Maybe
we could hang out in your bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Now’s not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Nothing. Let’s talk later.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Deacon, who is it?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I’m Naomi. I’m Deacon’s
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: His girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Deacon has two girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Shut up, Max!</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What do you mean? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Deacon’s other girlfriend is having dinner with
us.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is Deacon’s other girlfriend, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: His other girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I thought you were a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You need to have a talk with him. He
could be having S-E-X.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: I need to give him a goddamn medal.
What?</p>
<p><strong>foyer</strong>: Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles
him.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Are you insane? I’ve been fantasizing about
Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Fantasy and reality are two different
things, Deacon. Don’t fall in love with who you think she is. You have
to be sure you love the real person.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: So what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Go after her then. Or don’t. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. street - night 75</strong>: Naomi and Deacon are
arguing under a street light.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: She’s a porno actress in your porno film. She
had to pretend to be your girlfriend because she ran upstairs naked when
the light caused a fire. And you’ve never had sex with her or even
kissed her.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: So, I guess this means you’re not my
girlfriend anymore.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I want to come to the set tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Why not? I’m curious. I’ve never seen a porno
movie actually being made.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Matt and Fred will get really mad. We’re not
supposed to tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Tell them I’m a … creative consultant. For
the female point of view.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No offense, but the female point of view
doesn’t really matter in these films.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>76a int. vic’s “studio” - day 76a</strong>: Mike is surfing
the web while eating a large bratwurst sandwich. Vic enters in his
signature robe.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: This After School Special shit is amazing.
They’re getting a ton of hits off their stupid stories and they don’t
even have any product.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Are you sure those are the guys from the Pretty
Kitty?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s the same guys. Bingo. I just found out
where they live.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Give me that address. I’m gonna teach these
assholes a little lesson about the adult film business.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Vic!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You going like that?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Oh, yeah. Thanks Mike.</p>
<p><strong>77 int. vic’s car, parked - day 77</strong>: Vic checks the
address of the house against the print out.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Goddamn amateurs. Think they can screw with Vic
Ramalot.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>78 ext. street - day 78</strong>: They get out of the car and
Mike places the gun in his pants. They walk up to the front door and
bang. It opens, revealing</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: You Greitzer?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: Yes. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Ronald J. Greitzer?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: Yes. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Oh, I get it. Brilliant. You’re not even a
fuckin’ kid.</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: What am I doing? I’m retiring you from the
porno business. Permanently. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: Yes. Yes. Please don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: No more sweet young pussy, no more hot
school-girl fantasies, no more goddamn pornos “for virgins by virgins.”
You got me?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer’s wife</strong>: Please don’t hurt my husband!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: I’m sorry! I’ll never rent them again! It
was only that one time my wife was at her sister’s! Please! I promise
you!</p>
<p><strong>greitzer’s wife</strong>: You rented a dirty movie? You told
me it was Jakob the Liar!</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: What? I shouldn’t be entitled to a little
joy in life?</p>
<p><strong>greitzer’s wife</strong>: Now look at the trouble you’ve
brought to this house.</p>
<p><strong>greitzer</strong>: And I’m supposed to know the Religious
Right would come after me for renting an adult film?</p>
<p><strong>79 int. deacon’s house - kitchen - day 79</strong>: Dress
rehearsals. Naomi is sitting at the kitchen table talking to Ashley,
who’s wearing a sexy cheerleader outfit. Deacon is at the microwave
making popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Five hundred dollars a night?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Yeah, but if you can break into films, like
these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that
much.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Seriously. If these guys ever get their act
together.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What is she doing here?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Naomi is my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: And I wanted her to help out. Give the
script a female point of view.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Jesus, Deacon. Didn’t you see that Beatles
documentary on the History Channel? You’re pulling a Yoko Ono on us.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fine. Whatever. Let’s get started. I’m sure
she’ll be really helpful.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Oh, hey, Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys,
too?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, people. Places everybody. Let’s try to
do this with a little heart, okay? And action.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: This quadratic equation is so hard.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Well, maybe we should just stick to long
division.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong. She
wouldn’t be fantasizing about some geek.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He’s not a geek. He’s the Math Team
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: No, he should be really well-dressed, and
maybe he’s a foreign exchange student from Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Um, and the director is the only one who’s
allowed to say “cut.”</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who cares, Naomi?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Deacon agrees with me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Shut up, Coop. This is important.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: And my nuts aren’t?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: I’m sorry, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress
rehearsals for a porno shoot?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, sure. Why don’t we throw out the script
while we’re at it and “improvise.”</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Guys, I appreciate the money. It’s nice to
get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn’t helping my
career. I’ve got no footage for my reel.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Ashley, wait. I’m sorry. Ashley!</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: I love you!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Now what are we going to do? Your “girlfriend”
ruined everything.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Coop’s the one that smacked her.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Besides, if you losers knew anything about
women, we wouldn’t have this problem.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who asked you?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: I don’t have to take this.</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. the pretty kitty club - day 80</strong>: Ashley is
walking through the parking lot on the way to work.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Ashley?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Mrs. Lewis!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I, um, I’m… I’m going where you’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: To yoga class?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Yes. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: I haven’t seen you in class before.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: It’s my first time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Well, that’s great, Ashley. You’re
really going to love it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: It’s really easy, but if you can’t keep
up, just follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. yoga class - day 81</strong>: The entire class of
slackjawed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN yoga students stare in disbelief. Even the
instructor is amazed.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: is essentially folded in half, her legs
pinned well beyond her ears. She’s obviously been in this position
before.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. yoga class - later 82</strong>: The women are
gathering their things after class, some still eyeing Ashley
jealously.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You’re quite flexible, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Yeah, people tell me that all the time. You
know, I could teach you some of those moves. Mr. Lewis would love
it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Oh. Okay. Maybe later. Listen, Ashley. I
want to ask you something… personal. About you and Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You know Deacon is only seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Right. So I was just wondering. You
know. If you and Deacon… Well, if Deacon and you were…</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Um, no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Good. Good. That’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don’t have to worry
about Deacon. He’s a good kid. If you just let him make his own mistakes
in life, he’s going to turn out fine.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. naomi’s bedroom - night 83</strong>: Deacon and Naomi
are under the covers, making out.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: So, do you have anything?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You know. Protection.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Oh. Oh yeah. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Don’t you want to?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Then what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It’s my first time.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: That’s okay. Just go slow.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Every two minutes, they change positions.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a basic rule of porno.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut to:</strong>: They’re doing it standing up against
the door.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The door. Always a classic.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut to:</strong>: Deacon sweeps away all the stuff from
her desk and lifts her up on it. Naomi likes it.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Fantasy and reality are two different
things.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a basic rule of porno.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut to:</strong>: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state
of complete bliss, having had her first ever orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Fantasy and reality are two different
things…</p>
<p><strong>83a int. the pretty kitty club - backstage - night
83a</strong>: The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as
she’s getting ready to go on.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t know. It was weird. Is it supposed
to be so weird?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Of course it was weird. True love can only
exist between two women.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Just kidding. I don’t know, Deacon. Do you
like this girl?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Your heart is telling you that you don’t.
And I think it’s time you start listening to your heart.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever you
want. Or don’t. Whatever.</p>

<p><strong>dave</strong>: Vic.</p>
<p><strong>video dupe guy</strong>: Hey, Dave, there’s a guy on the
phone who wants to set up a new account.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>video dupe guy</strong>: Some outfit called After School
Special.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>video dupe guy</strong>: Nothing. It’s for another
customer.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Did you say “After School Special”?</p>
<p><strong>video dupe guy</strong>: Shit, man. You must be crazy. Better
watch your back, homie! You might get smoked!</p>
<p><strong>85 int. peachtree &amp; finch - day 85</strong>: Naomi is
dragging Deacon into the store featuring posters of buff male models
with nut-hugging boxer briefs.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What? I thought you might want some new
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t need any new clothes.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: And guess what? I booked facials for us at
the Serenity Spa.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Naomi. Wait. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this
afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Deacon, you don’t have to hang out with those
guys any more. Besides, you really need a facial. And I mean, I thought
we could spend the day together. You know, after last night.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: But what about Matt and Fred?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Well what about me?</p>
<p><strong>86 int. basement set - day 86</strong>: Deacon walks in
really late, but wearing a hot new Peachtree &amp; Finch outfit. And his
skin seems to glow. Matt and Fred glare at him from the far end of the
couch.</p>

another girl? What?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Matt and I have been talking.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. About what?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We want to make this movie.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I know. I do, too.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we
wrote. We want to make it without you.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Okay. I know what this is about, guys. I’m
sorry about Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s not the problem, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I thought this was about us having fun and
doing something crazy together. But as soon as you got what you wanted,
you blew us off.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Do you even like her?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Fine. Go ahead without me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. deacon’s house - kitchen - night 87</strong>: The
family eats dinner in silence. Deacon feels like shit.</p>

head was missing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: I have to go back to the office tonight.

lot and parks. He steps out of the car and starts to walk to his office.
Only it’s not his office. It’s…</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. the pretty kitty club - night 89</strong>: He passes
the Bouncer, still reading Aristotle’s Ethics.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. the pretty kitty club - backstage - night
90</strong>: Ashley is changing into her school girl outfit.</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: Ash, you ready? You’re up now.</p>
<p><strong>90a int. the pretty kitty club - night 90a</strong>: DEACON’S
DAD enters the club and pays the cashier.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: … they work hard for their money, guys, so
let’s tip them good. All right. Now, on the main carousel, let’s give it
up for the naughty school girl. ASHLEY!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Hello, naughty school girl whom I’ve

girlfriend, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Where did you see Ashley?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Over on Industrial Way.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: You were on Industrial?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You know, she is so flexible. It’s
really amazing some of the positions that girl can twist herself
into.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: She even offered to teach me. So I could
move like that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if
you’re into that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Maybe. I like her. I know she’s a little
older, but I think she’s good for Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>92 int. deacon’s bedroom - night 92</strong>: Deacon walks
past his desk and something catches his eye. He stops to look at a
picture of himself with Fred and Matt from fifth grade. He looks really
happy in the picture. Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures
taken yesterday with Naomi. She’s hamming it up for the camera, but you
can tell from his expression, they don’t belong together. He tosses the
Naomi picture onto the desk.</p>

Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So, what did you want to talk to us about?</p>

<p><strong>fred</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: For blowing you guys off.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That’s okay, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s just sometimes I feel
like the whole world is passing us by and we’re just sitting still. I
don’t know. Anyway, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You know, you can be a real dick
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Naomi and I did it the other night.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Good. At first. But then I kept thinking
about all the pornos. Trying to hit the right spots, positions. I don’t
know. After a while it kind of seemed like work.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I find that extremely difficult to
believe.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So what now? Do we make this thing?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe we should just call it
quits.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I need you.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I need you to make this movie. For my
reel.</p>

<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Make a wish.</p>
<p><strong>94 int. hairdresser - day 94</strong>: Roger is getting his
hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his wheelchair next to him. A few other
women are in the back, whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA
ARIA plays on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: So, I’m thinking about getting into
films.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: You have any tips on how to break
in?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Really? I didn’t think there was a lot
of acting in those films.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well, I guess it kind of depends.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: You think you could get me an
audition?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Come on. How long have I been cutting
your hair?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Since I was like eight.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: I know who you are. Don’t worry. Your
secret’s safe. Come on. I just want to make one film to see what it’s
like.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: That’s great. But how can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to
help you. That’s how it works. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: What’re you– Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>95 int. basement set as “the prom” - day 95</strong>: Coop
and Ashley have brought some help: Plantain and the Bouncer. They’re
waiting around for the guys. The room is their most elaborate set so
far, a hotel ball room, complete with themed prom banner, dance floor,
stage, etc.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: No, no, it’s a municipal bond fund.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: But what about the capital gains?</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Sure there’s short term capital gains, but the
dividends are tax free.</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: State and federal?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Hey, guys. I hope you don’t mind, Plantain
and Baxter want to be in the movie, too.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Hey! Mr. Runningbear!</p>
<p><strong>95a int. basement set - day 95a</strong>: Moments later,
cheesy prom MUSIC plays and a mirrored disco ball reflects light across
the dance floor. As the couple dances across the floor, dressed in a
prom gown and tux, Ashley looks into Coop’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Ira, I have something important to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: This prom is making me so hot. I’m ready to
lose my virginity to you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>95b int. basement set - day 95b</strong>: Coop and Ashley sit
in the back seat of a Split Car. Coop says, “Oh, Rachael. You’re the
best.” Fred looks over at Deacon, who just smiles sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>95c int. basement set - day 95c</strong>: The Bouncer and
Coop play chess as the guys capture the offscreen action. Ashley says,
“You’re the sexiest teacher I ever had.” The guys turn their heads
sideways to figure out the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have
gotten themselves into.</p>
<p><strong>95d int. basement set - day 95d</strong>: Plantain, dressed
as a chaperone with a big punch stain on her dress, is eating a tuna
fish sandwich and smoking a cigarette. Matt calls “Okay, people. Places.
Let’s get it together.” Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel,
hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with
Weylon J. Petunia’s.</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: My dress is ruined!</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I’m so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we
going to do?</p>
<p><strong>95e int. basement bathroom - day 95e</strong>: Fred is in the
bathroom with the Moisty-Mate, but he just can’t seem to get in the
mood. Through the door:</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: I never knew chaperoning the prom could be
so “hard.”</p>
<p><strong>95f int. basement set - day 95f</strong>: The Bouncer is
going at it with an ugly sex face, dripping with sweat.</p>
<p><strong>96g int. basement set - day 96g</strong>: Plantain speaks
with no real enthusiasm, “I give you an A+.” Matt asks her to do the
line again, but she says it exactly the same way again. One more time,
same result. Suddenly Coop lets out a huge FART and everyone starts
laughing. Matt throws his hands up, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>95h int. basement set - day 95h</strong>: Coop and Ashley are
in the back seat, post coitus.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: That was the best prom ever.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p><strong>95j ext. deacon’s house - back yard - day 95j</strong>: Matt
strips off the sheets, sprays them with lighter fluid, and sets them on
fire. As the flames rise up and FILL THE</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Cut. That’s a wrap.</p>
<p><strong>96 int. william wall high school - library - day 96</strong>:
Deacon is studying in the library.</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Deacon!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Rachael?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Hi, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Good. Good. How was France?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: It was so fun. We just got back yesterday.
The school totally screwed up my class schedule.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: So, how’s John Baldwin?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Who told you about that?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Everybody knows.</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Well everybody is a liar. I never did it
with John Baldwin.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Jesus, Deacon. I don’t even know him. It’s
not like it was with us.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. william wall high school - a/v room - day
97</strong>: Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the
computer.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So…?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: How does it look?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It looks great. It’s the best porno film I’ve
ever made.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Are you done with it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, I cut together some footage to give to
Ashley for her reel, but I don’t think I can finish this film.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I can’t even watch it. Every time I turn it
on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all
day long.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: That was pretty gross.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That’s just it. The movie looks great, but
seeing everything else – all the disgusting, nasty stuff – that’s what’s
taken all the fun out of it. And I just don’t want to do it any
more.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn’t handle
this.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Take it easy, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt
would wuss out.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You’re the wuss
here. At least I don’t have to whack off every time I see a girl in the
hallway.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Shut up, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a
man and admit this movie was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why don’t you make me?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No. Matt’s right. This movie was a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What are you talking about? This whole thing
was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Come on, Fred. Didn’t you think this movie
was going to be … I don’t know, sexy?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How long have you guys known about the
bathroom thing?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: If you didn’t like making the movie, why
didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you guys were having
fun. I didn’t want to be the wuss.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So what about the car?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: The Aerostar’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What about the money and the power and the
women? What about Tony Montana?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So what do we do with this?</p>
<p><strong>98 ext. amusement park - night 98</strong>: The tape is
burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A massive party is raging. Tons
of teenagers are dancing, drinking, and having a good time rocking to a
LIVE BAND. At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are
finally enjoying themselves.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Hey, guys. Great party.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I’ve got some big news. I sent the reel to
Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop to L.A. to talk about a
contract.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Wow. That’s great, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Deacon! Vinnie says we need more ice!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Hang on, guys. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Do you think me and Matt will ever get
girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have it
made. You’re smart, funny, fun to be with. In a couple of years, girls
will be dying to meet men like you.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always
get the girls. Hey, what was I supposed to say?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hey, guys. Great party.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. amusement park - parking lot - night 99</strong>: The
Bouncer is checking off names from the invite list. A long line of
people are trying to get in, including J.T.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: I can’t believe these losers are having such a
killer party.</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Hey, you’re not on the list, dude.</p>
<p><strong>j.t.</strong>: What’s with you, you pussy? Are you joining
the retard team, too?</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: Coop!</p>
<p><strong>coop</strong>: Plantain.</p>
<p><strong>plantain</strong>: Come on. You don’t need to wait in this
line. Deacon and the guys are already inside.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. amusement park - night 100</strong>: Ashley is
walking by Wendy and Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: I can’t believe Naomi dumped Jake for Deacon
Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Let me tell you something about Deacon. That
boy is amazing in bed.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Ashley. Deacon’s ex.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever given
you an orgasm?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I think so. No.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Have you ever felt so completely satisfied
in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?</p>
<p><strong>kelly and wendy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: You’re wasting your time giving those
Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they’ll probably wind up unemployed wife
beaters anyway.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: So, are Deacon’s friends seeing anybody?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Matt and Fred? I don’t think so. But if
you’re interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this
thing …</p>
<p><strong>100a ext. amusement park - night 100a</strong>: …and finds
Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She sits down next to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: How’s Naomi?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t know. Good, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I thought she was your fantasy girl.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. She was.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: You’re gonna dump her.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I don’t want to. I don’t know. It’s not like
it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff.
We just, I don’t know, connected.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Very good, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Oh, nothing. I guess I’m just glad that you
finally figured it out.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah, I guess I did. So I have to do this,
don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I guess. Or not. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>101 ext. amusement park - night 101</strong>: Deacon holds
Naomi’s hand and they walk and talk.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: There’s something I want to talk to you
about.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I’ve been thinking. Maybe we should see
other people.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Well, I mean, we don’t really have anything
in common. And we don’t really even get along.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You’re breaking up with me? Can we still have
sex?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Listen to what I’m saying, Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: The only reason I went out with you was
because I thought you were a nice guy. And now you’re breaking up with
me?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: If you tell anybody about this… I have a
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I won’t. You can tell people you dumped me
if you want.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Sure. What do I care?</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You see? You are a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Just don’t tell anyone about the movies. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: These guys are pornographers!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They’re perverts! They make porno movies in
their basement!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No one’s listening to you, Jake. Give it a
rest.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who will
believe me. Your parents.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: The web site is in someone else’s name. All
our records are encrypted. There’s no tracing it to us, jerk off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the tape
of Ashley masturbating in your basement. When they see that, they’ll see
what kind of movies their perfect little Deacon is making.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Did you make a copy of it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You sent the original tape to my
parents?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>naomi</strong>: You know, Jake, you’re a real dick!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You should probably avoid pissing her off.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Noted. Guys. We’ve got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. deacon’s house - foyer - night 102</strong>: A large
envelope labelled “OPEN ME” sits with the unopened mail on the foyer
table.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. amusement park - parking lot - night 103</strong>:
The guys get into the Aerostar.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Not so fast, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Which one of you is Balls McLongcock?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Good name.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Too bad you’re not going to be able to use it
any more.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: The competition. And who the hell are you,
coming into my town, paying girls double what I’m paying them? This
stupid After School Special shit is cutting into my business. So now I’m
putting you out of business.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. deacon’s house - family room - night 106</strong>:
The folks are reading.</p>
<p><strong>110a ext. abandoned warehouse - night 110a</strong>: CLOSE ON
the Aerostar bumper sticker, “My child is on the honor roll at William
Wall High School.”</p>
<p><strong>110b int. abandoned warehouse - night 110b</strong>: Deacon,
Matt, and Fred are bound and gagged, and hanging by their pants from
meat hooks. Mike takes their gags off and they starts whimpering.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Please don’t kill us, Mr. Porno Man.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Relax. We’re not going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re going to cut your balls off.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Start with him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why me? It was all Deacon’s idea!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Okay. Do the leader kid.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Quit squirming. It hurts a lot more if you
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Wait! Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Come on, kid. Take it like a man.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’ve got pre-orders!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We pre-sold copies of our video.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: How many? Fifty? A hundred?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred
twelve.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s a lot of product, Vic.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We’ve got orders from all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: We’ll give you the website if you let us
go.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Okay, so what’s your cut?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Except…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: What except? There’s no except!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Except you promise to supply us with quality
porn free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It could come in handy. I mean, until we get
girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, Matt!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And you have to maintain the artistic vision
of After School Special.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: The key is to try and remember what it was
like before you had sex. What did you used to fantasize about? A math
teacher who bends over a little too far. The door to the girls’ locker
room open just a sliver. Going over to visit your friend and catching
his mother coming out of the shower.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dude?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Not you. Deacon’s mom.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh yeah. I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. deacon’s house - parents’ bedroom - day
111</strong>: Deacon’s mom is showering, but the door to the bathroom is
open. Fred wanders into the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Deacon? Are you in here?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Guys!</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Okay. We’ve got a deal, but you gotta give me
all your master tapes. And kid. If you ever need a job, give me a
call.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s been a pleasure doing business with you,
Mr. …</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Ramalot. Vic Ramalot.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Good name.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Did you go through the mail today?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: Not yet. I’ll go get it.</p>
<p><strong>113a ext. suburban street - night 113a</strong>: The car
races around a corner.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: It’s a minivan! It can’t go that fast!</p>
<p><strong>114 ext. street - night 114</strong>: The car races down the
street.</p>
<p><strong>115 int. deacon’s house - foyer - night 115</strong>: His mom
approaches the Envelope and stack of mail.</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. deacon’s house - night 116</strong>: They run up to
the door and burst in.</p>
<p><strong>117 int. deacon’s house - foyer - night 117</strong>: Deacon
runs in and eyes: AN EMPTY TABLE.</p>
<p><strong>117a int. deacon’s house - living room - night 117a</strong>:
where his parents are sitting there waiting for him. He can tell by
their expression, they know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Looking for something in the mail,
Deacon?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No, I just–</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Maybe something you’d rather not have us
see.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Mom, Dad…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: It’s too late, Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Wait–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: We just want you to know how deeply
disappointed we are in you.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Explain? Explain?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: If you’ll just give me a chance…</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: How are you going to explain this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: How did you manage to get a “C” in
biology?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: I knew we shouldn’t have let him have a
girlfriend–</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Let alone two–</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Is that what this is about? My biology
class? It’s just a stupid midterm grade.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: I don’t like your tone, mister.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Mom, Dad. I’m seventeen now. I’m driving.
I’ve got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we broke up. But you guys treat
me like a kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a normal teenager with a
normal life?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: You broke up with Ashley?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun
with my friends, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Okay, then. Just make sure you don’t
repeat this performance on your finals.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: How much do you know?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Pretty much everything. Mr. Slam.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: These are my demands.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Done. Did you know all along?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are you kidding? Who do you think made the
first pre-order?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m really nervous.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: My advice is to go slow. If you feel you’re
losing control, just try to relax. Don’t worry. It’s easier than it
looks.</p>
<p><strong>int. dmv - day</strong>: Fred is about to take his driving
test.</p>
<p><strong>flash!</strong>: Fred gets his picture taken.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. deacon’s house - day 119</strong>: Deacon drives the
minivan home and pulls in next to the brand new convertible sports car.
Deacon gets out, excited.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: This is for me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Are you crazy? It’s for me. You want a
new car, you get an after school job.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: But we are letting you have the
Aerostar. It may not be “cool,” but it’ll get you where you’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Thanks, guys. Really.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: We’re going away for the weekend. Your
father surprised me!</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. william wall high school - parking lot - day
120</strong>: Deacon pulls the minivan into the parking lot. In the
passenger seat is Fred. In the back seat are Matt, Max, and Max’s three
FRIENDS. They all get out and the freshmen scamper away. Matt is holding
Deacon’s driver’s license.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s not even in focus. This is really shoddy
work.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So, guys. I decided I’m going to apply to NYU
next year. The film school.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Too bad we burned the film. You could have
submitted it as your sample.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Good idea, Balls.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So, I guess we all got what we deserved. No
money, no power, no women.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Tony Montana would be pissed.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Speak for yourself, guys.</p>
<p><strong>rachael</strong>: Hey, guys. Deacon.</p>
<p><strong>121 int. william wall high school - hallway - day
121</strong>: Deacon walks down the hallway with Matt and Fred, and
holding Rachael’s hand. The four of them run into Wendy and Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey, guys. Hey, Deacon. I heard Naomi broke
up with you.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Yeah. But I think it worked out better this
way.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing or two
about giving women pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Matt knows a thing or two about pleasuring
women. I know everything.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: We should go out some time.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Maybe all four of us could go out.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That could work, you know, depending on my
schedule.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Cool. So call me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Watch where you’re going, sphincter boy.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: I thought I told you not to call me that
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Some people never learn.</p>
<p><strong>121a on the monitors 121a</strong>: plays a specially edited
version of the infamous first attempt at making the porno, aptly titled,
“William H. Wall High School Presents: The Premature E-Jake-ulator.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve got a tiny pee-pee? I’m a premature
e-jac-u-la-tor?</p>
<p><strong>121b hallway 121b</strong>: Jake is horrified.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Stop it! Stop the video!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You probably shouldn’t have mailed that tape
back to us.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tiny pee-pee. Tiny pee-pee. E-jac-u-la- tor.
E-jac, e-jac, e-jac-u-laaaaaaa-tor.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: You know, guys, I’ve been thinking about
something.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: About how making the movie didn’t turn out
to be so fun. I think I figured out why.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Sex is like a comic book, still in the
original wrapper. Once you open it up and read it, it loses its
value.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Deep.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I think he’s got something there. Making that
movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn’t possibly
understand.</p>
<p><strong>deacon</strong>: Exactly. The fun part about high school is
unravelling the mystery of what’s going to happen next.</p>
<p><strong>121c ext. william wall high school - parking lot - day
121c</strong>: … where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new
sports cars on it. Their license plates read “JOHNNY H,” “SAM SLAM,” and
“BALLS.” TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing there
smiling.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. hotel room - night 122</strong>: Deacon’s parents
are in bed. On the TV plays familiar sounding porno music on the hotel
pay-per-view.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Why do they always have to show the guy’s
face?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lewis</strong>: To make you think you can get girls as
hot as her. It’s a basic rule of porno.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Hey. Isn’t that our basement?</p>
