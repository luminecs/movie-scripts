<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey Joey! Joey Doyle!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Terry? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey look-</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: �one of yours. I recognized the band.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the
last race.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He followed my birds into their coop. Here,
you want him?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Well I got to watch myself these days. Know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll bring him up to your loft.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’ll see you on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan,
tippi-tan… Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Go on, beat it!</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t give me that coffee, you rummy. Now
blow!</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Thanks for nothing, you bum.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Terry?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: That you, Terry?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Where’s Terry?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Come on. I’ll take one of you with me.</p>
<p><strong>ext�friendly bar�night</strong>: An old-fashioned corner
saloon with swinging doors. Standing on the corner, fl anked by a goon
aptly named the TRUCK is CHARLEY, THE GENT, Terry’s older brother,
rather handsome if a little too smooth, in his late thirties, a snappy
dresser in his camel hair coat and snap brim hat. He is quick-witted and
affable, more politician than mobster. Terry enters to him.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: How goes? TERRY He’s on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The pigeon?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Like you said. It worked.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: That brother of yours is thinkin’ alla
time.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All the time.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: I’m afraid somebody fell off a roof.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: He thought he was gonna sing for the Crime
Commission. He won’t.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You said they was only going to talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: That was the idea.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I thought they’d talk to him. Try to get him
to dummy up.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Maybe he gave them an argument.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I figured the worst they’d do is work him
over a little.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: He probably gave ’em an argument.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: He’s been giving our boss a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He wasn’t a bad little fella, that Joey.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: No he wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: Except for his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Talkative.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wasn’t a bad little fella …</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: Maybe he could sing, but he couldn’t fly.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Come on, kid. I’ll buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I kept tellin’ him: don’t say nothin’, keep
quiet, you’ll live longer.</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: Tell the ambulance to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>longshoreman</strong>: He ain’t gonna need no ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: One side. Le’me through!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Same thing they did to my Andy five
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’re Pop Doyle, aren’t you, the boy’s
father?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: He fell over backward from the roof� like
he was pushed. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: He was the one longshoreman with guts
enough to talk to them crime investigators. Everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Who asked you. Shut your trap. If Joey’d taken
that advice he wouldn’t be�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Everybody know that…?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I said shut up!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Look, I’m an honest cop. Give me some
leads and I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>kayo nolan</strong>: Listen� don’t bother him. Right,
Moose?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: One thing I learned� all my life on the
waterfront� dont ask no questions� don’t answer no questions. Unless
you… .</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: He was all heart, that boy. Enough guts for a
regiment.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Guts� I’m sick of guts. He gets a book in the
pistol local and right away he’s gonna be a hero. Gonna push the mob off
the dock singlehanded… .</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Take it easy, Pop. I know it’s rough
but time and faith are great healers… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Time and faith… . My brother’s dead and you
stand there talking drivel about time and faith.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Why Edie, I�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in
the neighborhood… . everybody said it, not only me. Who’d want to harm
Joey? Tell me� who? – who?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I wish I knew, Edie, But�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Don’t turn away! Look at it! You’re in this
too� don’t you see, don’t you see? You’re in this too, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Edie, I do what I can. I’m in the
church when you need me.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: “In the church when you need me.” Was there
ever a saint who hid in the Church?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Forgive her, Father. Them two was as
close as twins.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Whoever was in on this’ll burn in hell
until kingdom come… .</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Terry, Riley’s makin’ a bum outa that
Solari�</p>
<p><strong>johnny friendly</strong>: Turn it off. Them clowns can’t
fight. There’s nobody tough anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Hey, boss, Packy wants another one on the
cuff?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Here’s the cut from the shape-up. Eight
hundred and ninety-one men at three bucks a head makes�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Here, you count it. Countin’ makes me
sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: H’ya, slugger, how they hangin’?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: So-so, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t hit me, now, don’t hit me!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: We got a banana boat at forty-six tomorra.
If we pull a walkout it might be a few bucks from the shippers. Them
bananas go bad in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’ll ask ten G. Where’s Morgan? Where’s
that big banker of mine?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Right here, boss.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, J.P., how’s business?</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: Havin’ trouble with Kelly again, boss. He
Won’t take no loans and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: He’s my wife’s nephew.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: But he don’t take no loans.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: I got to give him work. She’d murda me…
.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: That’s why I stay single. Here’s the interest
on the day, boss. Five thirty two.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Count it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, Skins� –get away with that sheet metal
all right?</p>
<p><strong>skins</strong>: Easy, that new checker faked the receipt.
Here it is, boss.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Stow the receipt. I’ll take the cash.</p>
<p><strong>skins</strong>: Forty-five bills.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, Terry, front and center.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Count this.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Aw, you know I don’t like to count,
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s good for you. Develops your mind.</p>
<p><strong>skins</strong>: What mind?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Shut up. I like the kid. Remember the night
he took Farella at St. Nick’s, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A
big try.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Not a dent. Perfect</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: My favorite little cousin.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thirty-six� sev� aah I lost the count.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: OK� skip it, Einstein. How come you never
got no education like the rest of us?</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Only arithmetic he got was hearing the
referee count up to ten.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Now listen, Mac�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He
ain’t himself.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is.
Things like that� he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.
It softens ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Listen kid, I’m a soft tough too. Ask any
rummy on the dock if I’m not good for a fin any time they put the arm on
me. But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin’ watchman’s pension.
When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn’t work my
way up out of there for nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know, Johnny, I know… .</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Takin’ over this local, you know it took a
little doin’. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me
this� �to remember them by.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: When he got up and chased them they thought
it was a dead man coming after them.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I know what’s eatin’ you, kid. But I got two
thousand dues-payin’ members in my local� that’s seventy-two thousand a
year legitimate and when each one of ’em puts in a couple of bucks a day
to make sure they work steady� well, you figure it out. And that’s just
for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the
world. Everything that moves in and out� we take our cut.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Why shouldn’t we? If we c’n get it we’re
entitled to it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We ain’t robbin’ pennies from beggars. We
cuttin’ ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a
dozen piers� a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.
But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: It’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So look, kid, you don’t think we c’n afford
to be boxed out of a deal like this� a deal I sweated and bled for� on
account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he
c’d go squealin’ to the Crime Commission? Do you?�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: �Do you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should’ve
been told if�</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I make it twentysix twenty-three. You’re
fifty short, Skins.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Gimme.</p>
<p><strong>skins</strong>: I� I musta counted wrong, boss, I�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Gimme.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You come from Green Point? Go back to Green
Point. You don’t work here no more. Here, kid, here’s half a bill. Go
get your load on.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don’t want it, I�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Go on� a little present from your Uncle
Johnny. And Mac, tomorra mornin’ when you shape the men put Terry in the
loft. Number one. Every day. Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on
the coffee bags. O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thanks, Johnny… .</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: You got a real friend here, kid. Don’t
forget it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why should he forget it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy conners,</strong>: a freckle-faced fourteen-year-old
boy, approaches along the same stretch of roof seen in the mugging of
Joey.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: �I was gonna feed ’em, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: ’s all right, kid. I took care of ’em myself
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Boy, you must’ve been up early.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured�
They got it made. Eat all they want� fly around like crazy� sleep side
by side� and raise gobs of squabs.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I better get over there. O.K., O.K., I’m
coming. Don’t spill no water on the floor now. I Don’t want them birds
to catch cold.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Hey Jackie, what D’ya think of this
privileged character? Don’t have to shape up no more. Got himself a soft
touch up in the loft.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Waterfront Western Union. Terry looks around
at the restless men again.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: You’re doin’ lovely, Terry, very lovely.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: O.K., O.K., That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: What’s the matter wit’ you, success gone to
ya head?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I told you lay off.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: My ain’t we touchy this morning?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Go home, Pop. The lads who get work Today’ll
be chippin’ in gladly.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sure, we’ll take care of ya.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s the truth, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Thanks, boys, but I’m gonna shape. Who do you
think’s gonna pay for the funeral� Johnny Friendly and the boss
stevedore?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Hey, watch that talk. What you say?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: He was just tellin’ me how proud he was to
belong to a fine honest local run by such an outstandin’ labor leader as
Johnny Friendly.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Don’t get wise now, you.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Wise! If I was wise I wouldn’t be no
longshoreman for thirty years and poorer now than when I started.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Here� I brought you Joey’s windbreaker� Wear
it, Kayo. Yours is more full of holes than The Pittsburgh infield.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this
mornin’?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the
stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Haw, haw, haw� that’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: You’ll be needing a few dollars for your
extras, Won’t you, Pop? You’re three weeks behind on the last
twenty-five, but I’m willing to take a chance.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he
don’t borrow, he don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: You’ll work.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: I ought to belt you one, J.P.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: Raise a hand to me and… .</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: … .and you’ll tell Johnny Friendly.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: You’d be off the pier for good.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: All right, slip me a bill� and may you rot in
hell, J.P.</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: When I’m dead ’n gone you’ll know what a
friend I was.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Drop dead now, why don’t you, so we c’n test
your theory?</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: Condolences.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Do any of you men know Terry Malloy?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Malloy? Never heard of ’im.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Me neither</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: You’re Terry Malloy, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in
St. Nick’s a couple of years ago.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Our identification.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Waterfront� Crime� Commission� ? What’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: We’re getting ready to hold public hearings
on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: You haven’t heard the questions yet.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: There’s a rumor that you’re one of the last
people to see Joey Doyle alive.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And I still say� I don’t know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: We’re not accusing you of anything,
Mr. Malloy.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I hope you understand that.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: We only want to ask you a few things about
people you may know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: People I� You mean sing for you. Get out of
here before I�</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: I wouldn’t advise that, Mr. Malloy. Unless
you want to be booked for assaulting an officer of the law.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, I don’t know nothing, I didn’t see
nothing, I ain’t saying nothing. So why don’t you and your girlfriend
get lost.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: All right, Mr. Malloy, you have a right not
to talk, if that’s what you choose to do. But the public has a right to
know the facts, too.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: We may be seeing you again.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Never will be much too soon.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a
pigeon.</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Gimme the names, I’ll write ’em down in me
little book.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: One more word ’n I would’ve belted the two of
’em, badge or no badge!</p>
<p><strong>stevedore</strong>: Here’s the tabs for two hundred banana
carriers.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: A banana boat. It would be bananas. One of
these days me ship’s comin’ in from Ireland, God love ’er, loaded to the
gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Nolan, me lad, ye’re dreamin’ again.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: �Edie?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: What the devil is she doin’ down here?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Edie, I know your father well, and I’m sorry
for your troubles. But there’s been hundreds of murders down here and
practically no convictions� hardly any arrests.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Why, Mr. Rourke? Why?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The last fellow who talked was awful dead
when they pulled him out of the river. I guess the Sisters don’t teach
you things like that up at your school in Tarrytown. That’s the
waterfront.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Father Barry.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Hello, Edie.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’m afraid I spoke out of turn last night.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You think I’m just a gravy-train rider
in a turned-around collar?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Don’t you? I see the Sisters taught
you not to lie.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I’ve been thinking about your question
and the answer come up and hit me� bang. This is my parish. I don’t know
how much I can do but you’re right, Edie� I’ll never find out if I don’t
come down here and take a good look for myself.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: The following men report to the loft�</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Malloy.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pop never talks about this.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Don’t crowd me. Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>an old man</strong>: Give me a break, Mac. I been two weeks
out of work.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: I got five kids. I need a day bad.</p>
<p><strong>a beefy longshoreman</strong>: How about me, Mac? I knew your
old man.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Come on, you bums, push back. I’ll do the
pickin’.</p>
<p><strong>the old man</strong>: I’ll give four bucks for the job.</p>
<p><strong>beefy longshoreman</strong>: I’ll kick in five.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Hey, Sonny! Truck!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pop!</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Hey, Terry. Grab me on!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Here you go, Jackie boy.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Hey, give me that.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Give me that. It belongs to Pop. He saw it
first.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work� with
all them muscles.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Give it to me� my Pop’s job�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What makes him so special?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Things ‘re lookin’ up on the docks, huh,
Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Didn’t you recognize him, dopey. That’s Old
Man Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Doyle. Joey Doyle’s… .? … .You’re his… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Sister. Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You don’t want to lug bananas in the rain
anyway, do you, Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: Aah, give it to ’im.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Here you go, muscles. Nice wrastlin’ with
you.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Pop, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Sure, just the beak� It’s been busted
before.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Here�I got it for you.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Okay, I can use it� Now go back to the Sisters
where you belong. I’m surprised with you, Father, if you don’t mind my
sayin’ so. Lettin’ her see things ain’t fit for the eyes of a decent
girl.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Hey, Doyle, you got a tab?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Then get in there. Number three gang,
number one hatch, puh-ronto.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Our welfare officer. He’s been away three
times for assault and battery.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Outa the way. Come back tomorra.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What do you do now?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like he says. Come back tomorra.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Is this what you do, just take it like
this?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Five straight mornin’s I been Standin’ here
and the bum looks right through me. There’s always a couple hundred left
standin’ in the street.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shh. Sonny’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: And there’s nothing you can do? How
about your union?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: You know how a blackjack local works, Father.
Get up in a meetin’, make a motion, the lights go out, you go out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: If three guys talk on a corner, Johnny’s�
�boys break us up. Look at ’em.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Didn’t the miners� sailors� garment
workers� get rid of this years ago?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The waterfront’s tougher� like it ain’t part
of America. Anywhere else you got the law protectin’ ya. Here ya just
get knocked off and forgotten. Like�</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Shh, not here, across the street.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: River Street, you might as well be in�</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: What is this, a church picnic? Get outa here.
Excuse me, Father.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: That’s how it’s been ever since Johnny and
his cowboys took over the local.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Name one place where it’s even safe to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Use the church.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The bottom of the church.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: You know what you’re letting yourself in for,
Father?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Got a cigarette on you?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You heard me boys. Use the bottom of
the church.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Working hard?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s a living.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: You don’t mind working once in a while to
justify this lofty position?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I just fnished work. I counted the bags.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: We got a little extra detail for you. The
local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church.
We’d like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the
players. You’re nominated.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why me, Charley? I’d feel funny going in
there.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do
a little one for him once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But going in that church, I’d be stooling for
you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling
is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you’re with. When Johnny
needs a favor, don’t try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead,
join the congregation.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I thought there’d be more of you here,
but� the Romans found out what a handful could do, if it’s the right
handful. And the same goes for you and the mob that’s got their foot on
your neck. I’m just a potato-eater but isn’t it simple as one - two
three? One� The working conditions are bad. Two� They’re bad because the
mob does the hiring. Three� The only way to break the mob is to stop
letting them get away with murder. If just one of you would answer one
question, we’d have a start. And that question is� Who killed Joey
Doyle?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Not one of you has a line on� who
killed Joey Doyle?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Tommy Collins, you were Joey’s best friend.
How can you just sit there and not be saying anything?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll always think of him as my best friend,
but�</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Who asked him here?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Have a seat. I’m trying to find out
just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: The brother of Charley the Gent. They’ll help
us get to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Keep Charley out of this.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: You don’t think he’d be� helpful?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Go ask him, why don’t you ? Ask him
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Maybe I will� one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: One of these days.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Now listen, if you know who the
pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to
keep still until they cut you down one by one? Are you? Are you? How
about you, Nolan?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Father, one thing you got to understand. On
the dock we’ve always been D ’n D.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: D ’n D?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Deef ‘n dumb. Somethin’ c’n happen right in
front of our noses and we don’t see nothin’. You know what I mean. No
matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don’t rat.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Boys, get smart. I know you’re
Getting’ pushed around but one thing we got in this country is ways of
fightin’ back. Getting’ the facts to the public. Testifyin’ for what you
know is right against what you know is wrong. What’s ratting to them is
telling the truth for you. Can’t you see that? Huh? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>father vincent</strong>: This seems to be just about all we
can do at this time, I think you’ll agree, Father, and so I’d like to
close with a few words from St. Paul, “Come unto me… .”</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: That’s our friends.</p>
<p><strong>father vincent</strong>: What did I tell you about sticking
your neck out?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: These fellers need help, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>father vincent</strong>: Okay. Don’t blame me when they pack
you off to Abyssinia.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I’ll take my chances. We must be on
the right track or they wouldn’t be sending us this little calling card.
Who’s got a cigarette? You better go home in pairs.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Not that way.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, I’ll get you out.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You all right, Nolan?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Yeah, considerin’ they was usin’ my head for
a baseball!</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Nice fellows.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Those blood suckers. How I’d love to fix
those babies but�</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: But you still hold out for
silence?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You still call it ratting?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Are you on the level, Father?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it
off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the
way?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I’ll go down the line, Kayo, believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Baseball bats� that’s just for openers.
They’ll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around
collar.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: And I still say you stand up and I’ll
stand up with you.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Down to the wire?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: So help me God!</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Well, I had my fun, I’ve drunk my fill and I
tickled some good-lookin’ fillies� I’m on borried time.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: We’re off and running, Kayo.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I think we’re O.K.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: They play pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Which side are you with?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m with Terry.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’ll get home all right now.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I better see you get there.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Coffee, that’s a laugh. His belly is used to
nothing but rotgut whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: One little dime you don’t need. I know you�
you’re Edie Doyle. Your Brother’s a saint� �only one ever tried to get
me my compensation.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Remember, Terry, you was there the night he
was’?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, yeah� Here’s half a buck, go have
yourself a ball.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: I can’t believe it� a small fortune. You can’t
buy me� you’re still a bum! ’Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Look who says bum!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to
the old rummies. Did you know him very well?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Everybody knew him. He got around.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What did that man mean when he said you were…
.?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Aah, he’s a bottlebaby, he talks to himself,
the joke of the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I better get home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t be afraid of me. I ain’t going to bite
you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You know how the Sisters are.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You training to be a nun or something?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s a regular college. It’s just run by the
nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And you spend all your time just learning
stuff, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I want to be a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: A teacher! Dong!!! You know I admire brains.
Take my brother Charley. He’s very brainy. Very.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It isn’t brains. It’s how you use them.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I
seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street?
Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: In braids? That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looked like two pieces of rope. And your
teeth were�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I know. I thought I’d never get those braces
off.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Man, you were a mess!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I can get home all right from here�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The thought I’m tryin’ to get over is you
grew up beauteeful. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: The moment I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Some people got faces that stick in your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I remember you were in trouble all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Now you got me! It’s a wonder I wasn’t punchy
by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me
with! They thought they could beat an education into me�I foxed ’em.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Maybe they just didn’t know how to handle
you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How would you’ve done it?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: With a little more patience and kindness.
That’s what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about
them.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Pardon me while I reach for my beads.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What-what? Where you been the last four five
years? Outer space?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in
the country. He was afraid with no one home I’d� get into bad
company.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well he played it smart. Too many
good-for-nothin’s around here. All they got on their mind’s a little
beer, a little pool, a little� I better get you home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Boy, they sure fly nice, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Do you like pigeons?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s my own flock up there, getting their
evening workout. I won plenty of races with ’em. Listen, you want to see
them? Come up on the roof with me and I’ll show ’em to you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’d better go in.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I only live up there and across the roof.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, Edie, am I going to see you
again?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: You got some nerve.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: You know what I mean. Leave her
alone.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I was only talkin’ to her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: She’s off limits for bums like you.
Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I can look at her, can’t I? It’s a free
country.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Not that free.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You’re all packed. And here’s your bus ticket.
You’re on your way back to St. Anne’s.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pop, I’m not ready to go back yet.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a
cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from
things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with
Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Who is he, Pop?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Who is he! Edie, you’re so softhearted and
soft-headed you wouldn’t recognize the devil if he had you by the
throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie
the Gent, Johnny Friendly’s right hand, a butcher in a camel hair
coat.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I’m not trying to tell you he’s Little Lord
Fauntleroy.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He tries to act tough, but there’s a look in
his eyes that… .</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother,
here we go again. You think he’s one of those cases you’re always
draggin’ in and feelin’ sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you
had�the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it’s cockeyed to
boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little
Abyssinian… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He wasn’t Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian… .</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It’s the
same difference. Well don’t think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed
cockeyed Assyrian. He’s a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him
when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into
action.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He wanted to see me again.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to
have you go walkin’ with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now
get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: And learn about charity and justice and all
the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes
up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he
trembles with emotion.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: See this arm? It’s two inches longer ‘n the
other one. That’s years of workin’ and sweatin’, liftin’ and swingin’ a
hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to
myself�this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin’ decent. I
promised your mother. You better not let her down.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pop, don’t think I’m not feeling grateful for
all you’ve done to get me an education and shelter me from this. But now
my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and
keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren’t
living? I’m staying, Pop. And I’m going to keep on trying to find out
who’s guilty for Joey. I’d walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I
thought they could help me. I tell you I’m staying, Pop. Pop starts to
pull his belt out of his trousers.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You are like�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pop!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Jesus, Mary and Joseph, keep an eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>moose’s wife</strong>: My feet feels like dancin’. But the
rest of me just feels like settin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Okay� I guess they got enough exercise. Let
’em come in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I wonder how long she’s goin’ to hang around,
huh, Terry?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Be sure they got enough water.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I changed my mind. I feel real mean
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Good. So do I.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: The Golden Warriors.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I started them Golden Warriors. I was their
first Supreme Commander.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: My shadow. He follows me around like I was
Mickey Mantle. Thinks I’m a big man because I boxed pro for a while.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Here they come! The champion flock of the
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You don’t mind yourself at all, do you. Joey
used to race pigeons.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He had a few birds. I got up and fed ’em this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: That was nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred
miles away he won’t stop for food or water until he’s back in his own
coop.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I wouldn’t have thought you’d be so interested
�in pigeons.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I go for this stuff. You know this city’s
full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of ’em. They perch on top
of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: The things that go on.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How do you like that one?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Oh she’s a beauty.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She’s a he. His name is Swifty.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: My lead bird. He’s always on that top
perch.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He looks awful proud of himself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why shouldn’t he? He’s the boss.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: If another fella tries to take that perch
away from him, he lets him have it.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Even pigeons aren’t peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: One thing about them though, they’re
faithful. They get married just like people.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, once they’re mated they stay together
all their lives until one of ’em dies.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, you like beer?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Want to go out and have one with me?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: In a saloon?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special
entrance for ladies… .</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: �I’m only after havin’ one more wee bit�</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You and your one-mores. Now beat it.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Well, what do you know�Jackie just stole
home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I wouldn’t mind doing that myself.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What’re you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>singer of “kathleen”</strong>: Give me a Glockenheimer.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’ll try a� Glockenheimer.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Likewise. And draw two for chasers. Now
you’re beginning to live.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Not that way� like this. Down the hatch!
Wham!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Wham… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s quite� �nice.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How about another one?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: No thanks… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hit me again, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: See the fight last night? That Riley�both
hands. Little bit on your style.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hope he has better luck.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Were you really a prize fighter?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I went pretty good for a while, didn’t I, Al?
But� I didn’t stay in shape� and� �I had to take a few dives.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: A dive? You mean, into the water?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Naw, in the ring, a dive is-</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Now what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Describing you. A square from out there. I
mean you’re nowhere. Miss Four Corners.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What made you want to be a fighter?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might
as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed�never
mind how. Charley and I was put in a place�they called it a Children’s
Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers
and� But what am I runnin’ off at the mouth for? What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Shouldn’t we care about everybody?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What a fruitcake you are!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Isn’t everybody part of everybody else?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really
believe that drool?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him
before he does it to you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Our Lord said just the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m not lookin’ to get crucified. I’m lookin’
to stay in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I never met such a person. Not a spark of
romance or sentiment or� or human kindness in your whole body.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do they do for you, except get in your
way?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: And when things get in your way� or people
�you just knock them aside� get rid of Them� is that your idea?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen� get this straight� don’t look at me
when you say them things. It wasn’t my fault what happened to your
brother. Fixing Joey wasn’t my idea… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Why, Terry, who said it was?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry,
I didn’t like the way he kept lookin’ at me.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He was looking at everybody the same way.
Asking the same question.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, yeah… . This Father Barry, what’s his
racket?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: His� racket?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’ve been off in daisyland, honey.
Everybody’s got a racket.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: But a priest…?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You don’t believe in anything, do you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, down here it’s every man for himself.
It’s keepin’ alive! It’s standin’ in with the right people so you can
keep a little loose change jinglin’ in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: And if you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: If you don’t Keep your neck in and your nose
clean and You’ll never have no trouble down here.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: But that’s living like an animal�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’d rather live like an animal than end up
like�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his
name?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why keep harpin’ on it? Come on, drink up.
You got to get a little fun out of life. What’s the matter with you?
I’ll play you some music.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Help me, if you can� for God’s sakes help
me!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I� I’d like to, Edie, but� �there’s nothin’ I
can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in
a low voice says�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: All right, all right.. I shouldn’t ’ve asked
you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You haven’t finished your beer.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t want it. But why don’t you stay and
finish your drink.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I got my whole life to drink.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re not sore at me?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: For� not being any help?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Why no� I think you would if you could… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What are you crying for?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I thought I felt mean tonight. But I’m not�
I’m just� all mixed up… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, I’ll walk you through. It’s the
shortest way home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You like music?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We’re on!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, we’re good! The Sisters should see you
now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I� I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I
always knew the kind you just grab ’em And� I never knew a girl like
you, Edie.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s fun dancing with your eyes closed. I’m
floating. I’m floating… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie… .</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I been looking for you, Terry. The boss
wants you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: He just got a call from “Mr. Upstairs.”
Something’s gone wrong. He’s plenty hot.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m gonna take her home first.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I’d get over there, Terry. I’ll take the
little lady home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll come over when I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You know Johnny when he gets mad.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit
tryin’ to ask things about Joey. It ain’t safe for you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Why worry about me? You’re the one who says
only look out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Okay, get in hot water. But don’t come
hollerin’ to me when you get burned.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Why should I come hollering to you at all?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Because… because… Listen Edie, don’t get sore
now� but I think we’re getting in love with each other.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I can’t let myself fall in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That goes double for me.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Mr. Malloy, I was hoping I might find you
here.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: You’re being served with a subpoena,
Mr. Malloy.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at
ten o’clock tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I told you I don’t know nothin’ and I ain’t
saying nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And
you’re privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against
questions that might implicate you in any crimes.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know what you’re askin’? You’re
askin’�</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Mr. Malloy, all we’re asking you to do is
tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Goodnight, kid.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I won’t eat cheese for no cops, that’s for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He had him killed or had something to do with
it, Didn’t he? He and your brother Charley?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, your old man’s right, go back to that
school out in daisyland. You’re driving yourself nuts� you’re driving me
nuts� stop worrying about the truth� worry about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Look out for number one. Always number one. I
should’ve known you wouldn’t tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to
own you. I think he still owns you. No wonder everybody calls you a
bum.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t say that, Edie, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m tryin’ to keep you from being hurt� What
more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Much more, Terry. Much, much more!</p>
<p><strong>voice of johnny</strong>: Hey, genius.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I� I was just on my way up, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: By way of Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Only two times, why, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It must have been once too often. I think
your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Aw, Johnny… .</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that
church meeting.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nothing happened, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you
got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we’ll all be wearing
striped pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was a big nothing! The Father did all the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain
Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did
all the talking.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He
doesn’t know much.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He don’t, huh? Well, he knows thirty-nine
pages worth of our operation.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How’d you get that.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I got it. Hot off the press.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nolan? I knew he had guts but�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Guts! A crummy pigeon who’s looking to get
his neck wrung! You should have You should have known better than to
trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around
for laughs. But this is business. I don’t like goofoffs messing in our
business.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Now just a minute, I�</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: What the hell are you doing with his
sister? It’s that girl, Johnny, the little Doyle broad has him out on
his feet. An unhealthy relationship.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Definitely!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t see her no more. Unless you’re both
tired of living. Barney, you got her address? Now listen, if we don’t
muzzle Nolan, we’re into the biggest stink this town ever seen. We got
the best muscle on the waterfront. The time to use it is now� pronto� if
not sooner. And you know where you’re going? Back in the hold� no more
cushy job in the loft. It’s down the hold with the sweat gang till you
learn your lesson.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: An Ir-rish ship loaded to the gunnels with
foine Ir-rish whiskey!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us
after all.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: When we knock off let’s have a bit of a
party. We’ll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to
Joey and Edie� and death to tyrants everywhere… .!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You think one bottle’s enough for all them
toasts?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Patrick, me lad, I’m ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by
itself. Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you’re a walkin’
distillery.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father’ll
make me say at confession. It’ll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now.
Terry turns and approaches Nolan.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen� Nolan�</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: What are you down here for� to see we don’t
make off with any of Mister Friendly’s precious cargo?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nolan… .</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Come on, Kayo, get it up!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: And don’t be walking off with any of that.
You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Talk louder. I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: If you kept your ears wide open instead of
your mouth�</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: If I talk too loud it’s the fault of the
nuns.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: And what in blazes have the nuns got to do
with it?</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry
Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, “Nolan, don’t be swallowin’
ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say� �Talk with your
mouth wide open,” so if I’m loud don’t blame me� it’s the fault of the
nuns!</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Come on, knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Haw haw� that’s a good one, Kayo.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Knock it off! Stand clear. All right, take
it away.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nolan…!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: A doctor� he needs a priest</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I came down here to keep a promise. I
gave Kayo my word that if he stood up to the mob I’d stand up with him
all the way. Now Kayo Nolan is dead. He was one of those fellows who had
the gift of getting up. But this time they fixed him good� unless it was
an accident like Big Mac says.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Some people think the Crucifixion only
took place on Calvary. They better wise up. Taking Joey Doyle’s life to
stop him from testifying is a crucifixion� Dropping a sling on Kayo
Nolan because he was ready to spill his guts tomorrow� that’s a
crucifixion. Every time the mob puts the crusher on a good man� tries to
stop him from doing his duty as a citizen� it’s a crucifixion.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: And anybody who sits around and lets
it happen, keeps silent about something he knows has happened� shares
the guilt of it just as much as the Roman soldier who pierced the flesh
of Our Lord to see if He was dead.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: Go back to your church, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Boys, this is my church. If you don’t
think Christ is here on the waterfront, you got another guess coming.
And who do you think He lines up with�</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Get off the dock, Father.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do that again and I’ll flatten you.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: What’re you doing. Joining them�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Let him finish.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Johnny ain’t going to like that, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Let him finish.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Every morning when the hiring boss
blows his whistle, Jesus stands alongside you in the shape-up.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: He sees why some of you get picked and
some of you get passed over. He sees the family men worrying about
getting their rent and getting food in the house for the wife and kids.
He sees them selling their souls to the mob for a day’s pay.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: By Christ, the next bum who throws something
deals with me. I don’t care if he’s twice my size.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What does Christ think of the
easy-money boys who do none of the work and take all of the gravy? What
does He think of these fellows wearing hundred-and-fifty-dollar suits
and diamond rings� on your union dues and your kickback money? How does
He feel about bloodsuckers picking up a longshoreman’s work tab and
grabbing twenty percent interest at the end of a week?</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: Never mind about that!</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: How does He, who spoke up without fear
against evil, feel about your silence?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Shut up about that!</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You want to know what’s wrong with our
waterfront? It’s love of a lousy buck. It’s making love of a buck� the
cushy job� more important than the love of man. It’s forgetting that
every fellow down here is your brother in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: But remember, fellows, Christ is
always with you� Christ is in the shape-up, He’s in the hatch� He’s in
the union hall� He’s kneeling here beside Nolan�and He’s saying with all
of you�</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: If you do it to the least of mine, you
do it to me! What they did to Joey, what they did to Nolan, they’re
doing to you. And you. And YOU. And only you, with God’s help, have the
power to knock ’em off for good! Okay, Kayo? Amen.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: All right, fellows� break it up! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Edie… . Edie�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Oh� Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Joey’s jacket. I thought maybe Kayo’d like you
to have it back.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I� I brought this for you, Terry. It was
Joey’s. Yours is coming out at the elbows.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t rate it.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Go ahead, wear it.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Pigeons… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: There’s a hawk around. They’re scared
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie� I� I� never said this to a girl before,
I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you� you’re… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I know… I know… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Father, help me, I’ve got blood on my
hands.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Bless me, Father, for I have�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s the matter? I’ve got something That’s
chokin’ me. I’ve gotta get it out.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Someone else c’n take your
confession.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But you’re the one I want to tell� what you
said over Nolan� about keepin’ silent when you know the score� I’m
guilty� you hear me? I’m guilty… .</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I don’t want to hear it in there.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t get it!</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Tell it to me in there and my lips are
sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it’ll do the most
good.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But you’ve got to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I’ll find you a priest.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, it was me who set Joey Doyle up for
the muggers.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Come take a walk with me, kid, and
give it to me straight. There’s nothing I haven’t heard.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: �It started as a favor� for my brother� you
know they’d ask me things and it’s hard to say no� a favor� Who am I
kiddin’? They call it a favor but it’s do it or else. And this time the
favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought
they’d lean on him a little but� Last night with Edie I wanted to tell
her only it� stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin’ her
away� and I love her, Father. She’s the first thing I ever loved.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: About Edie?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I
know you got a subpoena.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s like carrying a monkey around on your
back.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: A question of who rides who.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: If I spill, my life won’t be worth a
nickel.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: How much is your soul worth if you
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But it’s my own brother they’re askin’ me to
finger� and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins.
When I was this high he took me to the ball games… .</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Ball games! Don’t break my heart! I
wouldn’t care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got
a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers�
and they’re all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets
mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you� � Listen, I’m not
asking you to do anything, Terry. It’s your own conscience that’s got to
do the asking.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Conscience… . I didn’t even know I had one
until I met you and Edie… this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is that all you’ve got to say to me,
Father?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: It’s up to you. Just one more thing.
You better tell Edie.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie… Edie… ..</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ve been sittin’ in the church.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, yeah, it’s up to me, it’s up to me� he
says it’s up to me.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Who says?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The Father. The Father.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry� what’s happening to you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I just told the Father.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Told him what?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What I did to Joey.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What I did to Joey.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Don’t tell me� don’t tell me!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie� it’s�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Didn’t know�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: �but don’t you see, Edie, I never thought
they’d� I don’t know what to do, Edie, I don’t know what to do! I swear
to God I�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie… Edie… What’ll I do, Edie, what’ll I
do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, Terry, guess who’s here… that joker from
the Commission… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here
after what you told him.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug
somebody put on somebody… . You think I should turn him in?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A cheese-eater! You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I’m kidding, I’m kidding. You don’t
think I should turn him in… .</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You was a Golden Warrior.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah� us Golden Warriors. You’re a good kid,
Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry.
Keep out of sight and I’ll tell him you’re out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But I ain’t out. I’m in. I’m in. Who’s lying
to who?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Not exactly. Just thought I’d sit down and
rest my dogs a minute. You know the next investigation we get into I
hope it’s got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been
nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top �oor the folks are
usually out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I guess it’s pretty tough work at that.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Well, it’ll be worth it if we can tell the
waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Didn’t I see you fight in the Garden one
night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wilson� yeah� yeah� I fought Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I thought you were going to take him that
night but…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You want to know something� I would have
taken Wilson�</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I think you could have.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: If I licked him I would have had the title
shot instead of him� boy, I was ready that night.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: You sure looked it. Something go wrong?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had
other ideas.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Such as what?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, this ain’t for publication.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I’m just resting my feet.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Remember the first round how I had him
against the ropes, and�</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: I’ll never forget it. I thought it was all
over.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. My own blood� and they sell me out for
a lousy bet� I had it in me to hit the top and� Boy, if I wanted to, the
things I could tell you about them guys�</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs
again. Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught
him?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looping right! I never swung wild. I was
strictly a short puncher� hooks� over ’n under� � whop-whop!</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, really!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Where you going? I’ll walk along with
you.</p>
<p><strong>glover</strong>: Sure… .</p>
<p><strong>j.p.</strong>: I didn’t hear them, boss, but I sure seen
them, walking along and smiling like a pair of lovers.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Drink up, Charley. We’re ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I’m not thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: After what we been hearing about your
brother, I thought your throat’d be kind of dry.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: So they’re walking along and smiling. That
doesn’t mean he’s going to talk. There’s no evidence until he gives
public testimony.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That’s
what we always kept you around for. Now how do we keep him from giving
this testimony? Isn’t that the� er� as you put it� main order of
business?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: He was always a good kid. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: He’sa bum. After all the days I give him in
the loft� he got no gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Please, Mac, I’m conducting this�
�investigation.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: This girl and the Father got their hooks in
him so deep he doesn’t know which end is up anymore.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I ain’t interested in his mental condition.
All I want to know is, is he D ’n D or is he a canary?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So do I, Charley. For your sake.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: What do you want me to do, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Very simple. Just bring him to… that place
we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if
you think you need him.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Gerry G!! You don’t want to do that,
Johnny! Sure the boy’s outa line, but he’s just a confused kid.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Confused kid? First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I’m just
another fellow down here.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Johnny, I can’t do that. I can’t do that,
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Then don’t.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: But my own kid bro�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This is for you to figure out. You can have
it your way or you can have it his way. But you can’t have it both ways.
Am I right, Sonny?</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Definitely!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Okay, on your horse, you deep thinker.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Gee, Charley, I’m sure glad you stopped by
for me. I needed to talk to you. What’s it they say about blood,
it’s�</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Thicker than water.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Four thirty-seven River Street.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: River Street? I thought we was going to the
Garden.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I’ve got to cover a bet there on the way
over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nothing ever stops you from talking,
Charley.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The grapevine says you picked up a
subpoena.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s right… .</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Of course, the boys know you too well to
mark you down for a cheese-eater.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Mm�hmm.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: You know, the boys are getting rather
interested in your future.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Mm�hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: They feel you’ve been sort of left out of
things, Terry. They think it’s time you had a few little things going
for you on the docks.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: A steady job and a few bucks extra, that’s
all I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Sure, that’s all right when you’re a kid,
but you’ll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It’s time you got
some ambition.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I always figured I’d live longer without
it.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: There’s a slot for a boss loader on the new
pier we’re opening up.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Boss loader!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything
that moves in and out. And you don’t have to lift a finger. It’ll be
three-four hundred a week just for openers.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And for all that dough I don’t do
nothin’?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you
say nothing. You understand, don’t you, kid?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah� yeah� I guess I do� but there’s a lot
more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: You don’t mean you’re thinking of
testifying against�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know� I don’t know! I tell you I
ain’t made up my mind yet. That’s what I wanted to talk to you
about.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Listen, Terry, these piers we handle
through the locals� you know what they’re worth to us?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn’t
going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: �ex-tanker who’s walking on his heels�
?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: What the hell!!!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I could have been better!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The point is� there isn’t much time,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I tell you, Charley, I haven’t made up my
mind!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before
we get to four thirty-seven River… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Four thirty-seven� that isn’t where Gerry
G…?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Charley… you wouldn’t take me to Gerry G…
.?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Take the boss loading, kid. For God’s sake.
I don’t want to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Charley… . Charley… . Wow… .</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I wish I didn’t have to do this, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wow… .</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: What do you weigh these days, slugger?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …eight-seven, eighty-eight. What’s it to
you?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you
were beautiful. You should’ve been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got
to manage you brought you along too fast.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It wasn’t him! It was you, Charley. You and
Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and
says, “Kid, this ain’t your night� we’re going for the price on Wilson.”
It ain’t my night. I’d of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready�
remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens�
This bum Wilson he gets the title shot� outdoors in the ballpark! � and
what do I get� a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for
me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I always had a bet down for you. You saw
some money.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: See! You don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I tried to keep you in good with
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You don’t understand! I could’ve been a
contender. I could’ve had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead
of a bum, let’s face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was you, Charley… .</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Okay� I’ll tell him I couldn’t bring you
in. Ten to one they won’t believe it, but� go ahead, blow. Jump out,
quick, and keep going… and God help you from here on in.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Now take me to the Garden.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, it’s me� let me in� it’s me!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Stop it! Stop it! Get away from here!</p>
<p><strong>voice of terry</strong>: I’ve got to see you. Got to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Leave me alone. I want you to leave me
alone!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I had to, Edie. I had to see you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Lucky Pop isn’t home, he’d kill you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You think I stink, don’t you? You think I
stink for what I told you?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it. I want you to
go.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me.
I want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: How can you be with Charley and Johnny
Friendly and still be with me? Either way it’s a lie. It’s like there
were two different people inside of you. You’ve got to be one or the
other.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t want to hurt Charley� I don’t want to
hurt you…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s you who’s being hurt. By keeping it
inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it’s got to come out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know what you want me to do!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t want you to do anything. Let your
conscience tell you what to do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That� �word again! Why do you keep saying
conscience, conscience… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I never mentioned the word before. In his
agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I keep hearing it and I don’t know what to
do..I don’t know what to do… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: My hand.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: It’s just a scratch. You won’t die. She turns
away from him.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love
me.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I didn’t say I didn’t love you. I said stay
away from me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie, Edie, I…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Stay away from me Stay away from me� Stay�</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: �away from me!</p>
<p><strong>voice from the street</strong>: Hey, Terry, come on down. I
got something to show you, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>voice from the street</strong>: Hey, Terry, your brother’s
down here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Charley?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Charley’s waitin’ for ya. Come on down and
see him.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Don’t go. Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But Charley� maybe Charley needs me. I better
see what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry… .</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You hear what I heard?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: That’s the same way they called Andy
out the night I lost him.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: And now for your weekly dramatic
thrill straight from the files of the City’s Finest� Police Patrol…
.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Don’t go down!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Tippi-tippi-tin, tippi-Tin… .</p>
<p><strong>loud voice</strong>: Drop dead!</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Spit on me, curse me and stone me, but I
suffer for your sins… .</p>
<p><strong>loud voice</strong>: Go suffer somewhere else, you bum.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: I seen it. I seen them put him to death! I
heard him cry out.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Who. Who did you see?</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: His executioners. They was stabbing him in his
side. And his soft eyes was looking down at them.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Tell me who.</p>
<p><strong>mutt</strong>: Our Lord Jesus. When He died to save us…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Oh get away� get away!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, I’m frightened. More and more
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m looking for Charley. I heard Charley was
waiting for me. Charley?</p>
<p><strong>same voice in fog</strong>: Wanna see Charley? He’s over
here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Charley… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looking for me, Charley?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey Charley.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He’s dead. He’s dead. Those scummy,
good-for-nuthin’ butchers!.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Behind me. Behind me. It may be them coming
back!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, let’s go away.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Charley.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I mean it, let’s get away from here, first
Joey then Nolan, now Charley� and any minute… . …I’m frightened� I’m
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll take it out of their skulls.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t want to see you killed. I want to live
with you. Live with you. Any place it’s safe to walk the streets
without… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll take it out of their skulls.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, no, no… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t hang on to me. And don’t follow me.
Don’t follow me. Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for
me. My brother. There’s something I got to do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: They put a hole in Charley. I’ll put holes in
them.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, go home. There’s nothing you can do
now. It’s locked up.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, you’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: No, I can’t let you. I can’t, you’re�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t want to hurt you, but… out of my
way!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is Johnny in?</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Give me a double.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Take it easy now, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: What’s wrong with your shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Listen, kid, why don’t you go home before
Johnny… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No advice. Just whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Easy. Easy, boy.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: What’ll you have?</p>
<p><strong>newcomer</strong>: Thanks just the same.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: You ought to go home and take care of
that�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: First things first.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: I want to see you, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You got eyes. I’m right in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Now don’t give me a hard time.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you want from me, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Your gun.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Mind your own business, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: This is my business.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why don’t you go and chase yourself?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Give me that gun.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You go to�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why you… .</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Get wise to yourself, you bum.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Take your hands off me. What you call me?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: A bum. Look what you’re doing. You
want to be brave? Firing lead into another man’s flesh isn’t brave. Any
bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to
hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley�
and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don’t fight him like a
hoodlum down here in the jungle. That’s just what he wants. He’ll hit
you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the
courtroom� with the truth as you know it� Truth is the gun� Drop that
thing and tell the truth� a more dangerous weapon than this little �
�cap pistol.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: That is, if you’ve got the guts. If
you haven’t, you better hang on to this.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You want a beer? Two beers.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Father, there is one thing I’d like to
do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Tell Johnny I was here.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: … nice boy… .</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: You mean to sit there and tell me that your
local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and
keeps no financial records?</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Sure we keep records!</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: Well, where are they?</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: We was robbed last night and we can’t find
no books.</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: Doesn’t it seem odd to you that five
different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only
articles removed were financial records?</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I
told you.</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: That’s all. Next witness!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Terrence Francis Malloy.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Right… I do.</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: Mr. Malloy, is it true that on the night
Joey Doyle was found…</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: …dead you were the last person to see him
before he was pushed off the roof, and that you went immediately to the
Friendly Bar where you expressed your feelings about the murder to
Mr. Johnny Friendly?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>voice of butler</strong>: Will there be anything else,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>voice of “mr. upstairs”</strong>: Yes, Sidney, if
Mr. Friendly calls, I’m out, and you don’t know when I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>voice of butler</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>counsel</strong>: .. Thank you, Mr. Malloy, you’ve done more
than to break the case of Joey Doyle, you have held up a lamp of truth
in the dark cave of waterfront crime. You may step down now.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re a walkin’ dead man! You’re dead on
this waterfront and every other waterfront from Boston to New Orleans.
You won’t go anywhere, drive a truck or a cab or push a baggage rack
without one of my guys have the eye on you. You just dug your own grave,
dead man, go fall in it!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry, Miss, our orders is to keep everybody
away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Next witness, Mr. Michael J. Skelly, also
known as Johnny Friendly… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi Chick� Jackie…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Have to walk right on top of me?</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: Orders, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re stepping on my heels� you’re making me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Terry, you’re hot, you know that, you
should be glad we’re this close to you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Trailing me like that, you make me feel like
a canary.</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Now beat it� go ahead� beat it.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Take it easy, Terry, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Edie.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I thought you might want some hot coffee.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thanks just the same.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Well, it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But I feel like� My friends won’t talk to
me.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Are you sure they’re your friends?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Jimmy� how’s the kid?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jimmy too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s voice</strong>: A pigeon for a pigeon… !</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Swifty� my lead bird�</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: He’s going to have to grow up too.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: My pigeons… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry, you better stay in for a while. I’ll
come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Every one of ’em… .</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You heard what Johnny said. No part of the
Waterfront’ll be safe for you now. Maybe inland� the Middle West
somewhere� a job on a farm… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Farm…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Does it have to be the waterfront! Pop, he’s
an old man, it’s all he knows, but you� you could do lots of things, get
into something new, anything as long as it’s away from Johnny
Friendly!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Doesn’t that make sense!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t think you’re even listening to me!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: …are you?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You’re going down there!</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Just because Johnny warned you not to, you’re
going down there, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You think you’ve got to prove something to
them, don’t you? That you are not afraid of them and� you won’t be
satisfied until you walk right into their trap, will you?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Then go ahead� go ahead! Go down to the
shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a� What
are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook
and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts
Joey’s windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts
the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so;
then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had
before.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You always said I was a bum. Well� �not
anymore. I’m going down to the dock. Don’t worry, I’m not going to shoot
anybody. I’m just going to get my rights. Joey’s jacket. It’s time I
start wearing it.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: I need fifteen gangs today. Everybody
works!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re still a man short for that last hatch
gang, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Hey, Sonny, go across to the bar and pick
up the first man you see.</p>
<p><strong>big mac</strong>: Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
You’re gonna need ’em.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: That ain’t a bad picture of you, boss.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: I wish you’d let us go to work on that
cheese-eater.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: After we get off the front page. Then he’s
mine. I want him.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: Here’s your man, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You want more of the same? Come back
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sonny</strong>: He’s comin’ down!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s gotta be crazy!</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: Yeah, here comes the bum now. I’ll top ’im
off lovely.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>truck</strong>: How are we gonna protect ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ever hear of the Sullivan Law? Carrying a
gun without a permit? They’ll be on us for anything now. The slightest
infraction. Give. All of you? Give� give� give�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’re a law-abidin’ union. Understand? A
law-abidin’ union!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Friendly! Johnny Friendly, come out
here!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You want to know the trouble with you? You
think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen, Johnny�</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Go on� beat it. Don’t push your luck.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You want to know somethin’�?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I said beat it! At the right time I’ll catch
up with you. Be thinkin’ about it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You want to know something? Take the heater
away and you’re nothin’� take the good goods away, and the kickback and
the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros� �away and you’re a great
big hunk of nothing� Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger
finger!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Go on talkin’. You’re talkin’ yourself right
into the river. Go on, go on… .</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m glad what I done today, see? You give it
to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of
your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap�
conniving�good-for-nothing bum! So I’m glad what I done� you hear me?
�glad what I done!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You ratted on us, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: From where you stand, maybe. But I’m standing
over here now. I was rattin’ on myself all them years and didn’t know
it, helpin’ punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an’… .</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on. I want you. You’re mine. You’re
mine! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That kid fights like he useta!</p>
<p><strong>longshoremen watching</strong>: They’ll kill ’im! It’s a
massacre! etc.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’s enough. Let ’im lay there.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: What happened? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Tommy, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Let me by.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You want ’im? You can have ’im. The little
rat’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Get some fresh water.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Terry…?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Terry… Terry… .</p>
<p><strong>boss stevedore</strong>: Who’s in charge here? We gotta get
this ship going. It’s costing us money.</p>
<p><strong>boss stevedore</strong>: Come on! Let’s get goin’!</p>
<p><strong>boss stevedore</strong>: I said� c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How about Terry? If he don’t work, we don’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Work! He can’t even walk!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on! Get in there! Come on, you!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: All my life you pushed me around.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on, get me outa here.</p>
<p><strong>boss stevedore</strong>: Let’s go! Time is money!</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: You hoid ’im. Terry walk in, we walk in with

<p><strong>edie</strong>: They’re waiting for him to walk in.</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: You hear that, Terry? Terry, did you
hear that? You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All
you gotta do is walk.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …walk?</p>
<p><strong>father barry</strong>: Johnny Friendly is layin’ odds that

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on, you guys!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Get me on my feet.</p>
