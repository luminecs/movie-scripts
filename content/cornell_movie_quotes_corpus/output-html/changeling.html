<p><strong>changeling</strong>: A True Story</p>
<p><strong>int. walter’s bedroom - later</strong>: Dressed now, she
flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with
light brown hair, though we don’t see much of it or him, he’s entangled
in the sheets. It’s important that we don’t see him too clearly in most
of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that
aspect.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter…time for school, honey.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just ten more minutes –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sorry, champ.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s cereal, it’s supposed to be cold.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We’re here, sweetie. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>int. pacific telephone company - switchboard room -
day</strong>: Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard
room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden
headsets…a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a
hundred female operators speaking at once.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Okay Sandy, what’s the prob–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: You deal with this one, I’m not going near
it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor,
ma’am, what can I – Yes, I can see that you’re on a party line, ma’am,
what can I – I know, it’s unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in
on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by – Well,
what’s he doing when you’re on the phone? Are you sure? Maybe there’s a
problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or – Oh. No, I…I’ve
never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there’s a first
time for everything, right? No, I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do
about people abusing the equipment or… themselves. I’m sorry. I –</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fine, Mr. Harris…fine…just someone having
a problem with a… with the connection.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Tell them to take the plug and shove it
in and out a few times, that’ll usually do it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Unfortunately that was part of the
problem. If you’ll excuse me….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hey, sport.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, mom.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So how was school?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Okay. We learned about dinosaurs, and I got
in a fight with Billy Mankowski.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He hit me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Did you hit him back? Good. Rule number
one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit
you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because I hit him.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait…you hit him first? Why?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He said my dad ran off because he didn’t
like me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Your dad never even had a chance to meet
you…so how could he not like you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then why did he leave?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, the same day you were born,
something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly
bigger than you. You know what was in that box? Something called
responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it’s what
you live your whole life for. Other people think it’s the scariest thing
in the world.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So he ran away because he was scared of what
was in the box?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s dumb.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter, I decided a long time ago that I
would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up.
I can’t expect you to respect me unless I respect you. I’ve never lied
to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything
to do with what was in the responsibility box.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Pinky-swear?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Pinky-swear.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: First one to the corner store gets ice
cream!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did I miss Amos and Andy?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m afraid so, sport. Come on now, time
for bed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are we still going to the movies
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Uh-huh. I hear there’s a new Charlie
Chaplin playing down at Grauman’s, and a new serial called The
Mysterious Airman.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t know. Nobody does. That’s what
makes him so mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. Am I too heavy for you to carry?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Not for years yet, Walter. Not for
years.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hello? Oh, hello, Margaret. I’m fine,
thanks. No, I was just – You’re kidding. When did she call in sick? What
about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it’s just…I
promised Walter I’d take him to the movies today. There has to be
somebody else…. All right, I…guess we can do it tomorrow. I’ll get there
as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: There’s a sandwich and milk in the
icebox, and I’ve asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a
couple of hours, just to –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Of course you can. She’s coming by to
check on the house, not you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Tomorrow, we’ll go to the movies. Then
we’ll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How’s
that? That okay?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not afraid of the dark. I’m not afraid
of anything.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I know you’re not, honey. That’s how I
raised you. Be good. See you in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>operators</strong>: We’ve got lines jammed from here to
Ohio…he insists on talking to someone in charge…I’ve tried everything
and the console’s just dead…I need your signature here for a supply
requisition….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: All right, get me the Omaha routing
station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers…and let’s
get that console running….</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Christine…good, I was hoping to catch
you. I’ve been following your work reports, and I just want you to know
that I’m very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: When I first suggested hiring female
supervisors, my superiors weren’t big on the idea. But you’ve held your
own as well as any of our male supervisors, and –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I –</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Ben, please. Point is, we’re looking for
someone to take on a managerial position in our new Beverly Hills
office. If you’re interested I can –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s great, Mr. Harris, I really
appreciate the vote of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Good, good…so maybe we could –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m sorry, but I really have to go. We’ll
talk on Monday. Good night!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait…wait…hold on, just a –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter…?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter? Honey? Time to come in.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Susie honey, have you seen Walter?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Nuh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mrs. Riley, I’m sorry to bother you at
dinnertime, but I was wondering if Walter was here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: No, I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Do you know if Jamie was able to look in
on him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: Well, I mentioned it to her, but she was
going to a dance with some of her friends…you know how teenagers are. Is
everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m sure it’s fine, I just… Thank you,
Mrs. Riley.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter…? Walter….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, Operator, give me the police.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, hello, my name is Christine Collins,
I live at 210 North Avenue 23…I’m calling to report a missing child…it’s
my son, he….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m not sure…I just got home from work
and…it could be since late this morning, it could be just an hour –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, of course, I –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, he always stays around the house when
it starts to get dark. Can you please send someone down here? I’m sorry,
but our policy is that we don’t dispatch units on missing child cases
for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What? But that’s –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s not Walter, he doesn’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Please, I –</p>
<p><strong>police dispatcher</strong>: I’m sure he’ll show up by then.
They always do.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Our thoughts go out again to
Mrs. Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights –</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. paul’s presbyterian church - day</strong>: Located
at 5100 Coliseum Street</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: – whose young son, Walter Collins,
disappeared almost two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Though she is not a member of our
congregation, we pray for her today</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Every day, new bodies show up along
Mulholland, or in ditches, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his
so-called “gun squad.” Every day the needs of honest citizens are put
second to greed and personal gain. Every day, the city sinks deeper into
a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of
Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our
brutalizers…where to be the law…is to be above the law…where none dare
speak truth to power. But we will not be silent. We will continue to put
their offenses and their failures in full view of the public. We will
not be intimidated.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Are you sure you’re ready for this,
Christine?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: I mean, if you need more time –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The police are doing all they can, and
frankly I could use the money. It’s been almost a month, and…it wouldn’t
do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn’t have a home
to come back to, right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Well…I’ll leave you to it, then.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Excuse me, can I have your attention?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Listen, everyone, I appreciate your
consideration, but I’m not made of porcelain. I won’t break down and cry
if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn’t go through. Actually,
I…promised myself that I wouldn’t cry…wouldn’t let myself cry…until I
knew, one way or another, what…. Point is…I like the noise here. So
don’t be afraid to talk and…push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn’t
noisy, how would I know I was in the right place?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Excuse me, has anyone seen
Christine?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I think I saw her in the back office.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: – well, if you do hear anything, would
you let me know? Thanks, I appreciate it. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>persons department, sacramento missing persons
department,</strong>: SAN FRANCISCO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT…on and
on…with each having multiple checks beside it, indicating all the times
she’s called. Her lunch sits untouched beside her.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Missing Persons department, please. Yes,
hello, this is Christine Collins, I…yes, fine, thank you. I was just
checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that
might match the – I see. No, I appreciate that, it’s just…it never hurts
to make sure all the lines of communication are working. I mean, that’s
what I do for a living, right? Well, I’ll try back next week. If you do
hear anything in the meantime, would you be sure to let me know? Thanks.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Missing persons department, please.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Two dollars.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hell…looks like I left my wallet at home. Can I
owe it to you?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: No credit. Pay up or I call the cops. I’m
tired of bums like you coming around here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m not trying to stiff you, chief. I just left
my wallet at home, that’s all. I’ll go back and get it. Five, ten
minutes tops.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: You got any collateral?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can’t ask for better collateral than a man’s
own flesh and blood, right? You stay here, son, I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Now don’t give me any trouble. He’s a good man
to trust us like this. You just sit here while I go get my wallet.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Ten minutes, then I’m calling the cops.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Ah, hell….</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Hello, Myrtle? It’s Harve, down by the diner.
Would you get me Sheriff Larsen? Yeah, I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What’s your name, son? Son…?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Swell.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: My name is Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park
Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child
cases, including your son’s, and…. He’s alive, Mrs. Collins. He was
picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He’s safe
and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we’ve got an APB out
for him now, and –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: All these reporters…you didn’t tell me
–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yours is a story with a happy ending,
Mrs. Collins. People love happy endings. Train should be pulling in
shortly. We’d better get a move on.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Thank you…we’ll have a statement for you in a
little while.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Did you know that Los Angeles is where
they make the Tom Mix movies?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: His horse is named Blue. You think they’ll
let me watch them make a movie?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: I don’t know, you’ll have to ask. But with
all this attention, who knows, maybe they will.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins, I’d like to introduce you to
Chief of Police James E. Davis.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, my, I didn’t expect –</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: We don’t get a lot of positive attention from
the boys in the press these days, so it’s good to be here when there’s a
positive story, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: I take it you’ve been treated well by my boys
in the department?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh…yes, of course, they’ve been great.
Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before
filing a report, but –</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Technicalities aside –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes…other than that, no complaints.
They’ve all been wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Good, then you won’t have any problem telling
that to the press, and how the LAPD is concerned first and foremost with
the safety of –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Women. Just a sec….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Walter…Walter!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Well? Aren’t you going to –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I…what are you –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s not my son. He’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’m…I’m sure you’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mistaken?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He’s been through four long, terrible
months…he’s gone through changes, lost weight –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I know my own son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’m just saying…I mean, you’re in shock, and
he’s changed, and –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s your name, son? Can you tell me your
name?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Walter Collins.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s a common name, it –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Do you know where you live, Walter? Do you
know your home address?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: My house is at 210 North Avenue 23, Los
Angeles, California. And that’s my Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins…listen to me. I know you’re
feeling uncertain right now, but that’s to be expected…a boy this age
changes so fast…but we’ve compensated for that in our investigation.
We’re experts in child identification. There’s no question that this is
your son.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s not Walter.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It’s not Walter as you remember him. That’s
why it’s important for you to take him home, on a…trial basis.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: A trial basis?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Once you’ve put him back in familiar
surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his
changed condition…you’ll see that it is him. I swear to you,
Mrs. Collins. I give you my word. Trust me…this is your son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: If there’s any problem, any problem at all,
come and talk to me and I’ll take care of it. Mrs. Collins…he has
nowhere else to go.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I…look, I’ll take him home, but only
because I…might not be thinking clearly right now, and –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: How does it feel to have your son home,
Mrs. Collins? What did you think when you saw him for the first
time?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It was…it’s…hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It was certainly quite a shock. At first she
hardly recognized him. Perfectly natural, the boy’s been through quite
an ordeal.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How’re you feeling, son? Bet it feels
great to be home.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Yeah, it’s great!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful
for all the hard work done by the De Kalb County Sheriff’s Department in
helping to make this joyful reunion possible. The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times, and –</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: Can we get a photo of mother and
son, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Was the sandwich all right? Would you
like some more milk?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Now you need a bath. You’re covered with
soot from the train ride.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought
them for Walter but he didn’t like the fabric, so –</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I fell. Stupid tub.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Did you hurt yourself? Let me see –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: …circumcised….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The last time I measured Walter – the
last time I measured my son – he was four inches taller than you are
right now. Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t know who he is, or why he’s
saying he’s Walter, but there’s clearly been some kind of mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: We agreed you would give him time to adjust
–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s four inches shorter than Walter.
Boys his age don’t shrink. If anything, he should be taller.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Maybe your measurements are off. Look, I’m
sure there’s a reasonable explanation for –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s circumcised. Walter wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins…your son was missing for four
months. For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet
unidentified drifter. Who knows what such a disturbed individual might
have done? He could have had him…circumcised… might have –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Made him smaller? Captain, please –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: – why won’t you listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I am listening, damn it, I – I am listening.
And I understand your feelings. He’s changed, no mistake. You’ve both
been through a terrible experience. That’s why he needs your support and
love to bounce back.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Captain, that boy wouldn’t bounce back as
my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins? You
seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you
enough to attend to his personal needs…so I don’t understand why you’re
trying to run away from your responsibilities –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m not running away from anything, least
of all my responsibilities. I’m even taking care of that boy because
right now I’m all he has. What worries me is that you’ve stopped looking
for Walter.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Why should we look someone we’ve already
found?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But you haven’t found him. He’s still out
there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt….</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: His identity has been confirmed by the best
minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: And I don’t? Captain, look, I don’t want
to cause trouble for you or the department. Honestly I don’t. I know
you’ve done everything you can…but there’s been a terrible mistake, and
I need your help if we’re going to correct it…before it’s too late.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain
Jones sent me. I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases.
May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh…yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Thank you for coming. I’m surprised
Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn’t
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Well, I’m here now, and we’ll put all that
to rights. Where is the boy?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Ah! There he is. A handsome young man. He
has your eyes, doesn’t he? And a little bit of the nose. Very fit, in
spite of all his travails. A very resilient boy you’ve got here,
Mrs. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to
help me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: I am. Captain Jones said the boy had gone
through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him…to
reassure you in this your time of motherly concern.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: My “motherly concern” isn’t for him
because he’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Statements like that will hardly help the
boy’s self-esteem, now will they? Captain Jones said something about a
change in height…?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s four inches shorter than –</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Ah, well…hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.
We’ve known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children.
Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually
shrunk. It’s uncommon, but within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What about the circumcision?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Very likely his abductor thought it
appropriate. After all, circumcision is hygienically sound. Must have
been quite traumatic at the time. No wonder he’s submerged the
memory.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Look, doctor –</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: As you can see, there’s a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this. But it’s good for you to raise
these questions. You should be apprised of all changes the lad went
through during his absence.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wouldn’t I know whether or not he was my
son? I’m his mother.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Which means you’re in no position to be
objective. You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy
who has changed from what you remember. He isn’t the same boy that left
here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn’t the same
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What’re you –</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Hello, children, my name is Dr. Earl W.
Tarr. I’d like to ask you some questions.</p>
<p><strong>1st kid</strong>: My mom says we’re not supposed to talk to
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Good boy. Quite right. But as you see I’m
with the police, so it’s all right. Now, I’m sure you know Mrs. Collins
here, and her son, Walter. How many of you recognize this young boy as
Walter Collins?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Now, now, no need to be afraid. Surely you
knew Walter, and played with him? So which of you can identify Walter
for me, for his mother, and for the police? This officer would want you
to do the right thing as good young citizens.</p>
<p><strong>2nd kid</strong>: Walter was as tall as me….</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Yes, precisely. He was as tall as you. Now
he’s not. He’s lost a little height, you see. It’s a thing called
trauma. With luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it
yourselves. So other than that, do you recognize this as your friend,
Walter Collins?</p>
<p><strong>2nd kid</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Dr. Tarr –</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins;
children can be intimidated. But not adults. Shall we try a
neighbor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: – and we’d appreciate it if you could make
a positive identification for us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: I’d be happy to. I saw the boy often.
Come closer, son.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Take your time…be sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: Oh, yes…yes…that’s Walter all right.
Used to come here all the time to play with my nephew, Roger.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Riley. You’ve been a big
help, I –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Before we go…Mrs. Riley, do you have the
time?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: Certainly….</p>
<p><strong>mrs. riley</strong>: My last concession to vanity; men don’t
make passes at women who wear glasses, you know. Five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: A boy is much larger than a watch,
Mrs. Collins. Come along, son.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: This is absolutely outrageous!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Captain, I…no, listen to me, this
so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of
derelict mother who couldn’t even recognize her own – He found what he
expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it’s
not – No, I am not reassured.</p>
<p><strong>i –</strong>: That I was embarrassed isn’t the issue, the
point is you’re wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I –
Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to
anyone else, all right? Fine.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I’m finished. Can I go to my room now?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes. Go on up.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: G’night, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Stop saying that! I’m not your mother!
And you’re not my son!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I was wrong to yell at you. You’re still
a child, and I think you don’t really understand what you’re doing, the
hurt you’re causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to
you, but I need you to understand. Walter is…he’s all I have, he’s
everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further
away from where I can help him. Whatever the police think, whatever the
world thinks, we know the truth, don’t we? We both know you’re not
Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to
straighten this out before it’s too late. Maybe you’re afraid of getting
in trouble, that you’re in too deep. But you’re not. You don’t have to
tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you’re not. Just…
tell them the truth.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio
broadcasts after my son…you were very supportive, and I appreciate –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, I –</p>
<p><strong>ext. collins home - pre-dawn</strong>: where a copy of the
Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor’s front lawn. She looks around,
then dashes to pick it up. She unfolds it as she heads back, then
abruptly stops. She can’t believe what she’s seeing.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: “Acting on the request of the Los Angeles
Police Department, Dr. Earl</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Lovely bit of phrasing, isn’t it?
Noticed since the return of the boy to his mother. Not only does it
state clearly that you are the boy’s mother, one could infer from this
that you are somehow responsible for these changes…and that the police
are concerned for the boy’s welfare in your hands. You should try the
eggs, they’re very good.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: “I examined the boy quite thoroughly,
Dr. Tarr said –</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: – and it’s clear that he has something to
tell. I’m sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire
affair, but not until he has faith in his listener. And that is what is
lacking: faith in the poor lad’s story. In the course of my examination,
I found nothing to dispute the findings by the LAPD.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How come he hasn’t been able to tell
anyone what happened while he was gone?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tarr</strong>: I would say that the boy has either been
coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what
happened to him during</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Captain Jones promised he’d let me see
the report before it went anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Someone in authority at the LAPD
lied? Good heavens, I may have to go lie down.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I was not laughing at your situation,
Mrs. Collins. It’s just…after one has this sort of conversation enough
times, a certain degree of hysteria begins to set in. Please, sit.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why are they doing this?</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: To avoid admitting a mistake…that
they brought back the wrong boy. Anyone reading that with half a brain
would see through it instantly. Sadly, that leaves out about half the
Times’ readership, but still….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: You have no idea how many people have
sat in that very chair and said those exact same words to me in relation
to our friends at the Los Angeles Police Department. Mrs. Collins, I
have made it my mission to bring to light all the things the LAPD would
prefer no one knew anything about…a department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: When Chief Davis took over the LAPD
two years ago, he said –</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: We will hold court on gunmen in the Los
Angeles streets. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will
reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: He picked fifty of the most dangerous
cops on the force, gave them machine guns and permission to shoot anyone
who got in their way. He called them the Gun Squad. No lawyers. No
trials. No questions, suspensions or investigations. Just piles of
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Bodies in morgues, bodies in
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road, barely alive. Not because the
police wanted to wipe out crime, they just wanted to get rid of the
competition.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Mayor Cryer and half the police force
are on the take. Prostitution, gambling, bootlegging, you name it. When
the gloves came off, pretty soon the rest of the department got into the
brutality act. Didn’t want the Gun Squad to have all the fun, after
all.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: The more they got away with it, the
worse things got, because when you give folks the freedom to do whatever
they want, as God saw in the Garden of Eden, they’ll do just that.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: This police department does not
tolerate dissent, contradiction… or embarrassment, Mrs. Collins. You
have the power to embarrass them…and they don’t like it. Not when they
became the Heroes of the Hour the day they stood there posing with you,
having rescued a lost boy from the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Reverend Briegleb…I appreciate what
you’re saying, and what you’re doing…but I’m not on a mission. The only
thing I want is to find my son, that’s all, and I just –</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: A lot of mothers’ sons ended up being
sacrificed to expediency around here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn’t be
the first. Do this right, and maybe yours will be the last.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: If they honestly thought I was wrong,
that’d be one thing…but if they don’t care, if they’re just trying to
cover it up….</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: This is their attempt to win by
framing the discussion their way. “Why, of course it’s her son…yes,
there have been changes…we’re looking into it, and isn’t it strange that
they happened after the boy got home?” They’re putting you in the
position of having to disprove what they’re saying…and that’s hard. Most
people believe what they hear from the police or the government. If you
play it their way, you…and your son…are going to lose.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Change the rules of engagement. Re-
define the argument. They brought in their expert, so you bring in
yours. You have an advantage they don’t. You know your son better than
they ever will, and in that knowledge is the proof you need. Get that
information, put it out there. Make them respond to you, not the other
way around.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Once people side with the police,
it’s a hard climb…but even in a town as loud as this one, the voice of
truth can be heard…if you’re willing to take it all the way in spite of
the dangers…and they are very real, Mrs. Collins, make no mistake. Once
you open the book on these people, you’re going to be looking over your
shoulder every day, maybe for the rest of your life. You up to it,
Mrs. Collins?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>dr. montgomery</strong>: He had two cavities that needed
filling. He put up a fight, but I took care of it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. montgomery</strong>: Your son’s upper front teeth were
separated by a small muscle. Made them sit about an eighth of an inch
apart. The boy in that room has no such gap.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Does a gap like that get smaller with
age? Because that’s what they’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>dr. montgomery</strong>: In some cases, yes, it’s possible.
But the muscle between Walter’s teeth prevents that from happening. They
can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle, and I
can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Will you be willing to sign a letter
saying that officially?</p>
<p><strong>dr. montgomery</strong>: Pardon my language, but…hell,
yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. montgomery</strong>: Sounds like the anesthetic is
wearing off. On the other hand, maybe I’ll write that letter first. Give
the little fella something to think about.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well? What do you think? Is that the
Walter Collins that you remember?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: If it is, he’s changed enormously. Do you
know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: You’re a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Yes, but even teachers have names. What’s
mine?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I don’t remember. I know you, but I don’t
remember your name.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: My name is Mrs. Fox. Now, take your
seat.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: I didn’t say take a seat. I said take your
seat. Your assigned seat. You must know which one it is, you sat there
for over a year.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Try again. Here’s a hint: There’s only one
more empty seat left.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. fox</strong>: Mrs. Collins, if that’s your son, I’ll eat
my yardstick. Not only will I put that in writing, I’ll swear to it in a
court of law and in front of President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have
to.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I’ll see you tonight at eight for my
broadcast. I’ll leave the back door open and a light on. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Good morning. My name is Christine
Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins,
disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought
to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you,
that this boy was my son. They were wrong. The Los Angeles Police
Department made a mistake…a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not
my son. That is the reason for the supposed “transformation.” I have
letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this
boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should
have them for you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I have given the police department every
opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son.
Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my
case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish
the job they started, and bring my son home to me. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Morelli, I want you to find the Collins woman
and get her here. Bring her in the back way, and have a couple of
matrons standing by.</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why are we using the back door?</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: Captain’s orders. Front’s jammed with
reporters.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Hey…anybody want to take a call from
the Royal Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What’d they do, lose a moose?</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada. He’s living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: All right, I’ll take it, got nothing better
to do….</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Leave the boy for now. We’ll look after
him.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’ve put us through quite a bit of trouble,
Mrs. Collins. This situation has become an embarrassment for the entire
department.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It wasn’t my intention to embarrass
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No, of course not. You just told the papers
we can’t tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we
spent working on your case. Are you trying to make fools out of us? Is
that it? Do you enjoy this?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, of course not. I had to get your
attention, I had to make you understand…he’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You know what your problem is? You want to
shirk your responsibilities as a mother. You enjoyed being a free woman,
didn’t you? Enjoyed not having to worry about a young son. You could do
what you wanted, go where you wanted, see anyone you wanted. But then we
found your son. Brought him back. And now he’s an inconvenience. That’s
why you cooked up this whole scheme, to try and throw him to the state,
let the state raise him for you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No? Even the boy says he’s your son. Why
would he do that? How would he know to do that?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t know! All I know is that he’s
lying!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But that’s how
he’s been trained, isn’t it? Lying was born in both of you. You’re a
liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me you’ve got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Just a minute –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Because either you know you’re lying, or
you’re not capable of knowing if you’re lying or telling the truth. So
which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are you a derelict mother? Or just nuts?
Because from where I sit, those are the only options.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m not going to sit here and take this
–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You want to bring in experts? Doctors? Well,
I can do that too. Matron?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins…do you still insist that the boy
out there is not your son?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait…what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Please don’t struggle, ma’am. You’ll only
hurt yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You are to convey the prisoner to the Los
Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No…wait, you can’t –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Make the following entry in the booking
department: Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others,
and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about
March 10, 1928, when she reported her nine-year-old son Walter
missing.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The boy was gone until July, 1928. Since his
return, she has complained that he is still missing, and has made
repeated requests that he be found, saying, “This is not my Walter,”
even though positive identification has been established.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution, and dislocation from reality. She may be a threat to
herself or others. We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic
ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored.</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Got another code twelve.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Collins. Christine.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait…please, this is a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Certifying officer?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights
division.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Please…you have to listen to me. The
police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me
and tell me he was my son, but it wasn’t my son, and now they say I’m
crazy –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, god…oh god, please, no….</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If you continue to struggle I’ll have to put
you in a straitjacket. Do you want that? Good. Then behave yourself.
Code twelve.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, please, you have to listen to
me…wait…please!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Take off your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Physical examination, body cavity search and
de-lousing. Required for all new patients.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s not necessary –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You can remove your clothes yourself, or I
can have the orderlies do it for you. Which do you prefer?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Spread your legs. Wider.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Inside.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: This is your room. The doctor’s left for the
day. He’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The morning? But…wait, I’ve got to talk
to someone in authority –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: My room…no, no…this is…this is MY
room….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Then if I could just use the phone.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Phone privileges are earned by good behavior.
You’re not allowed newspapers, magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.
This is for your own good.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait…please! There’s been a terrible
mistake!</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: My room. My room. They SAID it was MY
ROOM!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m sorry, I –</p>
<p><strong>ext. hospital - continuous</strong>: We slowly PULL AWAY from
the narrow window, and the sound of screaming, into the late afternoon
rain and growing darkness.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Problem?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Overheated, that’s all. She’ll be fine in a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Listen, could you give me a hand? I’m trying
to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Northcott Ranch…oh yeah. You’re almost
there. Follow this west for about two, three miles. Then the next right.
That’ll bring you right to it. Something going on?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Just looking into a juvenile matter. Thanks
for the help.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: This is the police. I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark. Open the door and stand aside.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Stop it! Stop it or I’ll push your face
through the floor!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: On your feet.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Jesus…what the hell’s wrong with you? Don’t
you know assaulting a cop is against the law?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: What difference does it make now?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: We’re just sending you back to Canada, son,
it isn’t the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: You can’t just stay in the U.S. as long as
you want, pal. We’ve got a orders to send you back home, and –</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Didn’t know Canada was that funny.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: No word from Mrs. Collins? Get on down to
her house, make sure she’s all right. If she’s not there, call the LAPD,
see what they know.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb of
St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church, bringing you the Lord’s word on radio
KGF. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: I had hoped to have a guest with us
tonight, but apparently she has been delayed. Since she can’t be here to
tell you what she told the press this afternoon, I’ll fill in the best I
can. I’m going to tell you what happened, and I’m going to keep telling
you right here, every night…until someone does something about it.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’d like a ticket to Canada. Alberta or
Vancouver, whatever’s leaving tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ticket vender</strong>: Don’t have anything going that far
tonight. Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle. From there you
can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>ticket vender</strong>: Round-trip?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: One way.</p>
<p><strong>ticket vender</strong>: That’ll be fifteen dollars.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Can I see the doctor? Or someone in
charge –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Breakfast is half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But I –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Down the hall. The doctor will call for you
when he’s ready. Go or stay, either way I lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: You should eat. Eating is normal. You
got to do everything you can to look normal. That’s the only chance
you’ve got. Besides, you’ll need the strength.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: My name’s Carol Dexter. What’s
yours?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Christine. Christine Collins.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Finish it all. I know it’s hard, but
you have to try. Lunch isn’t as bad. Close, but not as –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I won’t be here that long. As soon as I
can talk to a doctor, they’ll realize there’s been a terrible mistake
and –</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Yeah, that always works. I heard them
talking. You’re here on a code twelve, police action. The doctors, the
staff, they figure that if the police sent you here, there must be a
good reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Then I’ll just have to prove that I’m not
insane.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Yeah? How? The more you try to act
sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you’re
delusional or stifling hysteria. If you don’t smile, you’re depressed.
If you’re neutral you’re emotionally withdrawn and potentially
catatonic.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You seem to have given this a great deal
of thought.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: I have. Don’t you get it? You’re code
twelve. So am I. We’re here for the same reason. We pissed off the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: What, you thought you were the only
one? The lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up.
When she tried to tell somebody, they sent her here. And that one? The
police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms. When she
complained to the papers, they picked her up and…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: I…work nights. I mean, I work nights.
Downtown. In some of the clubs. You know.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: This one client started hitting me,
and he wouldn’t stop. So I filed a complaint. Turns out he was a cop.
Next thing I know, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But how can they –</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: You’re kidding right? Hey, everybody
knows women are fragile, right? They’re all emotions, no logic, nothin’
goin’ on upstairs. And sometimes, like when they say something that’s a
little, y’know, inconvenient…they just go fucking nuts, pardon my
French. If we’re insane, nobody has to listen to us. I mean, who are you
going to believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of
the force, or a police officer? Then once they get us in here, we either
learn to behave, and shut up, or – Or you don’t go home…or you go home
like that.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Better finish up your oatmeal. Want to
look sane for the doctors. Then I want to hear what they nailed you
for.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Clark…Sanford Clark.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Paperwork’s come through. You’ll be
deported back to Canada day after tomorrow. The police there will to
decide what to do with you next. I hope your stay here has convinced you
not to try crossing the border illegally in future.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Wait, I…I want to talk to the officer who
brought me in.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: I’m sure he has far more important
things to do than –</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Please. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: He’s off-duty until tomorrow, but…
I’ll see what I can do. No promises.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: How far you going?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Don’t worry about that, pal. Just a little
insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so
they could run booze over the border. You can’t be too safe, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah, I surely do.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Mrs. Collins…Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please,
have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I hope your stay has been comfortable so
far.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Really? I’d think it would be quite
difficult at first.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But
comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I see they took a blood test.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis.
Apparently it can affect the mind.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: The idea that someone thinks you should be
checked for syphilis…did that upset you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No. Not at all. I’m sure it’s… standard
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to
cover all bases, and –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But…at the same time…I imagine that it
would be…would probably be upsetting to…some people that someone else
might…suspect that of them. However inappropriate that might be.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: According to your file, you believe the
police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I didn’t say they substituted a fake boy,
just…not the right boy. They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son.
He’s still missing.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: That’s strange…you see, I have here a
newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming
your son home. That is you in the photo, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: So at first he was your son, but now he’s
not your son. Has this been going on for a long time? People…changing,
becoming something other than what they are?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: People don’t change, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: You don’t think people change?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s not what I –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: And the police…they’re not out to persecute
you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: The police are here to protect us.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: That’s odd, because according to the head
nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do
this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also
conspiring against you…or you’re changing your story. Do you often have
trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: I’m sorry to bring you out in this
weather, detective, but the boy has been quite insistent.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: It’s all right, I’ll just see what he has to
say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Room seven.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: It’s raining cats, dogs and democrats out
there, so this better be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Look, I – this isn’t easy, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Nothing is.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: My cousin’s Gordon Northcott. He owns the
ranch where you found me. He let me live there in exchange for watching
the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that. Said I could
stay on as long as I wanted to. I figured that also meant I could leave
whenever I wanted to, but he wouldn’t let me.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Are you saying he held you prisoner? Bull.
When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird.
Could’ve left any time you wanted. So what’s this, some kind of story to
cover why you were in the country illegally?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: No…no, it’s nothing like that.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Because I don’t have time for –</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Listen to me, please. He said –</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What? What did he –</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: He said that if I tried to leave, he’d kill
me!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Okay, lets start at the beginning. What did
he make you do?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Him and me…me and Gordon, we… …we killed
some kids.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: I didn’t mean to, I swear…he made me help
him, said if I didn’t he’d kill me, too. Please, you gotta help me…I’m
scared…I don’t want to go to Hell for killing kids.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What kids?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: I don’t know…I never knew their names.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: How many kids?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: All together?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: About…twenty, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: No, it’s true, I swear!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Twenty kids.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Yeah…thereabouts…I kinda stopped counting
after a while, and Gordon said one or two might’ve gotten away, but
–</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids
–</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: We did…yeah, we did that….</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Most times we’d bring back just one or
two…sometimes as many as three.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: I always knew when he was getting ready
’cause he’d go through the car and clean it up, make sure the tires were
good, the engine…he was always afraid something’d break down and we’d be
caught.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: We’d go a different direction every time,
never hit the same part of town twice. Sometimes we’d go for hours, just
driving around, until we found somebody.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: He’d use all kinds of different stories.
Sometimes he’d say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking
for a lost dog…that one worked real good. Other days –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: There you are, we’ve been looking for you
like mad.</p>
<p><strong>flash-image</strong>: to a different kid, a different
street.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sure thing. Your folks, they got in an
accident. They sent us to find you. They’re hurt real bad. The police
took ’em to the hospital, but they didn’t have time to come find you, so
we said we’d do it. Now come on, hurry…we gotta get to the hospital, see
your folks.</p>
<p><strong>flash-image</strong>: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks
to Sanford.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: A lot of kids won’t get in a car alone with
a stranger, but when he’s got a kid there with him, that made it easier.
They’d look to me, and figure if I was safe, they would be too. That’s
why he needed me, see?</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: It’s okay. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>flash-image</strong>: Back to the first kid, who takes one
last BEAT, then gets into the car.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Every time they got in the truck, it was
like I wanted to die.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Good boy! Now hold on, it’s a long drive and
we gotta fly.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Then, as soon as we got back to the
ranch…they went in the coop.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Some days he’d do ’em right off. Other
days, he’d wait, pick up a few more, keep ’em in the coop until he had
like four or five, ’cause – – ’cause he liked to hear ’em scream all at
once. Like they were some kinda chorus. And then….</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: …and then….</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: – as the long ash at the end of
Ybarra’s cigarette, TUMBLES to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end,
SHATTERING when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full
speed.</p>
<p><strong>sanford</strong>: Sometimes…sometimes he’d leave one or two
of ’em alive…barely anyway…and tell me…finish ’em. Finish ’em…or I’ll
finish you. And I did…I did…oh god…oh, sweet Jesus…I killed ’em…I killed
’em…I killed ’em….</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: These…uhm…these kids…do you think…if you saw
them again, do you think you’d recognize them? Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: I haven’t updated these in a while, but
still, it should be…. Just go through…and if you see any faces you
recognize, put it on the table.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: …shit….</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Have you gone soft in the head, Les?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Sir, I –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He’s playing you! He knows he’s in trouble,
so he’s come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to
stay in the country –</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: With all due respect, sir, I don’t think so.
You didn’t see him, the kid’s scared half out of his mind –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He picked the Collins kid! We found him,
remember? Haven’t you been reading the papers? Or maybe you have, is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Sir, if you’d just listen –</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m sorry, captain, but he’s here
again…that reverend, Briegleb. He’s asking about Christine Collins.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off
police property before I have him arrested for disturbing the peace.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I tried. He said he’s not leaving… him,
or his friends.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Jesus jumped down….</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Ybarra? Listen. You’re not to do anything
except come back here.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Sir, department policy requires that all
allegations of homicide have to be investigated. And these are kids, for
chrissakes –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Departmental policy is what I say it is, you
got that? Now I’m ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid,
you got that? You bring him here and you talk to no one, got it?
Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: All right, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Are you Captain Jones?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: What the hell have you done with Christine
Collins? Don’t try and lie your way out of it. I talked to several
neighbors who saw her being driven off in a police car.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Collins has been placed in protective
custody following a mental breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: A what?!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Her statements and behavior have been found
to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a
danger to herself or others. In the public interest, we are looking
after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sorry, we’re withholding that information to
respect the privacy of the family. But I can assure you that she’s
getting the best treatment available. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>voice on pa</strong>: Line-up for medication. Line up for
medication….</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Go on. Move up.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Medication.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What kind of medication?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: The kind that’s good for you. Help you
relax.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t want to relax…I’m fine, and I
won’t take something unless I know what it is!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Orderly –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Just listen –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: – we can force-feed it to you if that’s what
you want.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Doctor…Doctor Steele –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m not
taking anything until –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I understand. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t have anything wrong with me that
I should have to take medication.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: You’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Then you shouldn’t have any trouble signing
this.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: By signing, you certify that you were wrong
when you stated the boy returned by the police was not your son. It
further stipulates that the police acted properly in sending you here
for observation and absolves them of all responsibility for –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I won’t sign it.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Then your condition is not improved. Sign
it, and you can be out of here first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I won’t sign it!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I was not wrong! That boy is not my son!
And I am not going to stop telling the truth about this! And you’re not
going to stop me, and the police aren’t going to stop me –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Mrs. Collins, you’re becoming agitated.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: – I will tear down the walls of this
place with my bare hands if I have to, but one way or another –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Orderly!</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: The patient is disturbed, hyperactive and is
threatening the staff. See to it she is properly sedated.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, I won’t let you! Someone, please,
help me!</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Stay out of this! This is none of your
business! This is police business! You’ll stay out of it if you know
what’s good for you!</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: You’d think you had enough trouble with the
law just being a whore, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Attacking a staff member. Room eighteen.
Electro-convulsive therapy.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Carol! No, leave her alone! What’re you
–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Carol….!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: It’s all right, I’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: We need him for questioning. Come on….</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: You two…you’ve just been requisitioned for
backup. I’ll explain on the way.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Wanted…to. Felt…good.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: I lost…two babies…to back alley
doctors…no choice…. Never had…the chance…to fight for them. You do.
Don’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I won’t…I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Fuck them…and the horse…they rode in
on.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s hardly appropriate language for a
lady, now is it?</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Hell, yeah…there are times…that’s
exactly the right thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: And when’s that?</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: When you’ve got…nothing left to
lose.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: All clear.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: All right. Show me.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: This it? You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Dig. You put ’em in the ground, you can take
’em out of the ground. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Holy god….</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Call it in…get the coroner and every officer
in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: You can stop now, son. You can stop now.
It’s over. We can take it from here. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Privacy, please.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I see you’ve still been refusing medication,
requiring force-feeding. I see they switched to a rubber tube. I hear
that can quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no progress. We
may have to go to more…strenuous therapies. Unless you’re willing to
prove you’re doing better…by signing this.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fuck you….and the horse…you rode in
on.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Room eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir, please –</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: I’m head doctor on duty. What’s the
problem?</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: You the doctor who’s got Christine Collins
locked up in here?</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Sorry, we don’t discuss our cases with
anyone other than family –</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: You’ll damned well discuss this one with
me!</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Sir –</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Read it! Read it, damn you!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The doctor wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Mrs. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: One last time. Are you, or are you not,
prepared to sign that letter?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: You’re free to go.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: …what?</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Your clothes are in the next room. You can
change there.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Next door.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: That’s right. See to it.</p>
<p><strong>steele</strong>: Christ….</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: You’re getting out?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I am out.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: How –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t know…but I couldn’t go without
saying goodbye –</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: Christine, don’t be stupid, get out of
here fast in case they change their mind.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I will…but I want you to know: once I
have my boy back, I’m coming</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: You are crazy.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: You give me every piece of paper you’ve
got on this case, you hear me? Every piece!</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: When does she come down?</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - continuous</strong>: Where Christine walks
among the sidewalk traffic. Free. Vindicated. She starts to pass a

<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Mrs. Collins…Christine…!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No…god…no….</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I’m sorry…I didn’t want you to find
out like this…I’m sorry…I’m sorry….</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: The chief will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: I don’t know if you’re aware of it, Captain,
but I have an exceptionally good vocabulary. I’m a terror at Scrabble,
crossword puzzles, but even I’m in awe of the vocabulary that the press
and the city council have been exercising in reference to this
department courtesy of the Christine Collins…incident. Incompetent.
Cowardly. Bullying. Reprehensible. Mendacious and invidious…those two
courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus words in Scrabble, both of
them. Especially invidious. Hard to work that one into a conversation.
But he managed it, all right.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sir, I –</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The key, of course, is the context in which
words like this get used. You have to do that in scrabble, you know,
when somebody challenges a word…show how it’s used in a sentence. So
“incompetent,” as in – “A department so incompetent that they never
realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered
under their very noses.” And here: “So incompetent that they insisted
they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him
upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with
evidence of their own reprehensible behavior.” That was a two-fer.
Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence. Guy must be a real
terror at crossword puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Captain, your handling of the Collins case
has exposed this department to public ridicule. There is even the
potential for civil and criminal liability.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sir, nobody could have known what was going
on up at that ranch. Not us, not the Sheriff’s Department, the
Marshall’s Office…as for the Collins woman…. I’m still not convinced
that her kid is among the victims up in Wineville.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Maybe he was…which raises the obvious
question: so what?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this
to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins
was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if
the boy you brought back isn’t Walter Collins, and he’s not dead up at
that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we
haven’t found him. Why we aren’t we doing our job. But if, on the other
hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in
Wineville…then the inquiries stop. It’s a momentary embarrassment that
you’ll have to live with…but better a short inconvenience than a
lingering problem, wouldn’t you say, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The boy’s been gone for nearly a year. If he
was going to be found, it would’ve happened by now. Whether he was up at
that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere. Better
his mother accepts that now rather than later, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Good. That’ll be all, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sir, there’s talk of an investigation by the
police commission.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Let me worry about the commission. But it
wouldn’t hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back
from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his
bullshit same as we did. That we were all taken in by the scheming
little bastard may help take some of the sting off this.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: My boys are working on it now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I want a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Tough.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: “Tough!”</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Walter Collins.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Walter Collins is dead.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Look, let me explain something to you.
Because of your lies, you’ve ruined a woman’s life embarrassed the
police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Got a lot done, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: All right, if that’s how you want it, then I
guess we’re done here. Tell County Jail we’re remanding him for
trial.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Wait…what’s remanding? What trial?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: I told you, the real Walter Collins was
murdered.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: So? I didn’t do anything! I wasn’t even
here when it happened!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: By pretending to be Walter Collins, you’re
interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. We can
try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact. Too bad. County Jail
is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. A lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: You can’t do that…I’m just a kid!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Sanford Clark is a kid, too. Fifteen. But
he’s going to jail. All murderers and their accomplices go to jail.
Everyone knows that. Get him out of here. It’s out of my hands now.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: Wait! I don’t want to go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Arthur Hutchins.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: The boy’s real name is Arthur Hutchins
Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Did you check the wire services?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Checks out. The report was filed by his
divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy’s grandmother.
Apparently he didn’t like living with the old lady, she didn’t let him
get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day…he up and
left.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What about the man he showed up with at the
diner?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Just some drifter. The boy was hungry, ran
into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay
for it. Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut
out. When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire
reports about missing kids –</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And he overheard them say the name Walter
Collins.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: But why that one? I mean, of all the police
departments he could’ve screwed up, why Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: I asked him the same question.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I…I knew that Los Angeles was where they
made the Tom Mix movies. I figured maybe I could meet Tom Mix. Maybe
he’d even let me ride his horse. His horse is named Blue. Did you</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: A little better, thanks. The sleep
helped. Anything new outside?</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Nothing that can’t wait until you’re
stronger. The police still have a car parked outside. They want to know
what your next move is.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’ve been giving that a great deal of
thought ever since I got out of that…place. All those women, and what
they did about Walter…. They’re going to just keep on doing it, aren’t
they? Nothing’s going to change…unless we make it change.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I used to tell Walter, “Never start a
fight…but always finish it.” I didn’t start this fight…but by god I’m
going to finish it.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: It’s dangerous, and you’ve already been
through a great deal, Mrs. Collins. Right now you’re sufficiently
high-profile that the police will hesitate to come after you out in the
open…but if they see their position threatened, that could change
quickly. Your life could be in danger.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: “Always finish it. Always.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. row house - vancouver - evening</strong>: A series of
red-brick rowhouses line a quiet street. We see couples walking, hand in
hand, kids playing…then we notice Gordon Northcott coming around the
corner. He looks around, then cuts across a yard, jumping over a fence
to get to</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: Just a minute….</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hi, sis.</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: Gordon…I didn’t know you were back in
town.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Got in a couple of days ago, figured I’d
surprise you. That okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: Yes…yes, of course. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Where’s that little niece of mine?</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: She…went into town. Should be back
this evening. Bob’s here –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Good. Need to talk to him about staying on
for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: Staying –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Listen, can I use your bathroom? It’s been a
long ride and I could use a shower.</p>
<p><strong>rachel clark</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Is that – Go next door. I’ll call the police.
Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mountie</strong>: Go around the other side! Cut him off!</p>
<p><strong>second mountie</strong>: Go on! Get the bastard!</p>
<p><strong>mountie</strong>: Screw this…I’m too old for this fightin’
shit….</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a friend
of mine, Mr. Hahn.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your
loss.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Can we come in?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes…of course.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mr. Hahn, was it?</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I appreciate the sentiment, but so far
they still haven’t positively identified any of the…remains… as
Walter’s.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: But he was identified, was he not?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, but…I guess I still can’t accept it.
It doesn’t feel real to me.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five
years ago. There’s not a day goes by I don’t think, I should mention
this to Claudine… then I remember she’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m sorry. Please, sit.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’ve been on the phone all day with the
appointment secretary for the police commission. They won’t let me
testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it’s not
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I know. My sources tell me the police
commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole
thing. They’re going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did
absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid…and with
you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own
safety.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Then we’ll just have to hire a
lawyer…bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a
hearing by the Welfare Board.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Jut one problem.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I see….</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Which is why I’m doing this pro bono. It would
be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen years as a
lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have,
in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here
the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he’ll need it all
if he’s going to get the City Council involved.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Of course. One thing, though. A personal
favor. When we’ve finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to
come with me downtown.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Of course. Where downtown?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes? May I –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: My name is S. S.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry, but the doctor in charge won’t be
in until tomorrow morning and –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Let me be clearer. Either you open those doors
and produce the people named in that court order, or you will find
yourself on the other side of those bars…without a key.</p>
<p><strong>carol dexter</strong>: I knew you’d come…I knew you’d come
back…I knew you’d come….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s all right…everything’s going to be
all right now….</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Northcott, any comment on your
arrest?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m feeling fine.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How did you avoid capture?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well, I didn’t, did I? Didn’t know anyone
wanted me until just recently. Didn’t even try. My luggage still has my
initials on it.</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: Did you know why the police were
after you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No, but I figured it would be best if I
stayed out of it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Anything to say to the parents of the
children you murdered?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Mayor Cryer…this is unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: So was this.</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: Subpoenas, requests for depositions,
interrogatories…all courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his new client, Christine
Collins.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Goddamnit….</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: I thought this was supposed to go away. This
is an election year, I can’t afford this kind of press.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: It is going away, sir. I instructed Captain
Jones –</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: I’m afraid falling on his sword and saying he
made a mistake isn’t going to be good enough, Chief. If we take him out
of the picture for a while, it might help calm things down until the
hearing’s finished. There are several people on the council who are
planning to run against me, and they’d love to accuse me of allowing a
renegade police force to operate with impunity.</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: Our friends in the press are having a field
day with this mess. I’m getting five hundred phone calls, letters and
telegrams a day demanding to know what the hell is going on at City Hall
that we allow our police force to brutalize women and misplace children.
Christ, all this picture needs now is for somebody to kick a puppy for
the cameras. This is a train, Chief, and we need to either get in front
of it, or be run over by it.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Mayor Cryer…I stand by my men. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: I do. And you know where I stand. So the
question is..are we going to stand together…or hang together?</p>
<p><strong>mayor cryer</strong>: Gentlemen…gentlemen, please. As Mayor
of Los Angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which
has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins. As
a result, we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln
Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What’s the charge, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: The charge is conduct unbecoming an
officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It
further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by
incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without
sufficient cause.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City
Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins
case?</p>
<p><strong>mayor cryer</strong>: I’ve heard this, yes. But since one of
the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to
suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the
question is moot.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Which makes it look like the only reason
Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: I won’t even dignify that question with
a response. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>cryer</strong>: Cheer up, Chief. That little show should take
the wind out of their sails. By Monday, this issue will be as cold as
yesterday’s fish. Never underestimate the public’s lack of attention and
potential for apathy. Old news is dead news, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Reverend, what –</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs. Collins,
but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job. These
three gentlemen are members of my congregation who, before coming to the
Lord, had lived lives of brutality, vice and crime. Now they are pledged
to doing god’s work…and if this isn’t it, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: People who bring charges against the
police have a habit of</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I see…well, I…thank you. Can I get you
anything?</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Since we don’t plan on sleeping, coffee
would be lovely.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Traffic’s getting heavy. We’ll go up
Spring.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>briegleb</strong>: Start walking. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Almost there. Just a few more
blocks.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Where is all this traffic’s coming
from…?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Excuse me, can you tell me what the
problem is up ahead?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Didn’t you hear? It’s the biggest protest I’ve
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Protest?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yeah…over that Collins broad, if you can
believe that.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He didn’t mean…he couldn’t mean –</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I don’t know…all I know is that I
think I just stopped breathing….</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh…my….</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: The Lord works in mysterious ways,
Mrs. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Boy howdy, does He ever. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen…can I have your
attention, please….</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: There are nearly one thousand people
gathered in this chamber, more than have ever been in this room
before.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: I therefore ask you to refrain from
demonstrations of any kind. We’re all here because we want to find out
the real facts in this case, and everybody is going to be heard if we
have to sit here for a week.</p>
<p><strong>second councilman</strong>: Mr. Thorpe, I don’t see any other
members of the Police Commission.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: That’s odd…we specifically stipulated that
we would begin our hearings with testimony from the police department.
Are there any representatives of the Police Commission in the room? Is
Chief Davis here? Is Captain Jones here? Is there anyone here
representing the police?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Chairman…Richard Thomas, The Evening
Herald. Both the Police Chief and Captain Jones are in San Pedro for a
police inspection at a station there.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: Are you telling me they directly violated
the wishes of the City Council? That they refused to attend a vital
hearing so they could conduct a routine inspection in San Pedro? And
what the hell is Jones doing at an inspection after being suspended? I
hate to call a recess before we’ve even started, but I think a few phone
calls are in order. So we’ll take a half hour break, then continue with
the witnesses who have appeared here today. But let it be known that
Captain Jones and Police Chief Davis will be subpoenaed and required to
appear here tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Mrs. Collins, could you come across the street
with me for just a moment?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But…shouldn’t we –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: I think there’s something you should see.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: – the police decided it was best to keep this
off the main docket in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos we have
across the street.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clay</strong>: Mrs. Collins? I’m Leanne Clay, this is my
husband, John…I just wanted to pass on my sympathies. What we went
through, waiting to hear anything about our son David, was bad enough,
and now this…. But there was no call for what the police did to you…no
call at all.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hey…I saw you in the papers. You got a lot
of moxie, standing up to the police like that.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been
charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an
additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney’s
office. How do you plea?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Not guilty, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: In light of the defendant’s penchant for
international travel, no bail will be set. This court will receive
preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for
the earliest opening on the court’s calendar. The defendant is remanded
into custody. Bailiff….</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as
missing on March 10, 1928.</p>
<p><strong>int. city council room - day</strong>: Jones is at last on
the stand. Hahn stands before him, the rest of the City Council,
Christine and the huge audience looking on.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: We then instituted a nationwide search. On
July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his
description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning, he
admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport
him back to California.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not
her son.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes. She denied his identity in spite of all
evidence pointing to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: But as subsequent events have demonstrated,
she was correct. So what prompted you to send her for psychological
evaluation?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Whether or not this was in fact the correct
boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted
strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when
presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent
conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I
submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles
County General Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Just like that. You snap your fingers and an
innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She wasn’t –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Every home in this state is in grave danger
when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes
later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own
authority!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She wasn’t –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: What was that, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She wasn’t thrown. She was… escorted.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn’t matter,
Captain. What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without
a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: I am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of
insanity that was issued in the case of the State of California
vs. Christine Collins. Who signed the affidavit?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: And what is the date on this document?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: September 12th.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated on September
6th.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The form is backdated.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Yes, so it would appear. The bottom of the
page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served.
But it has not been filled in. May I assume from this that the warrant
was never served?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: That’s correct. There was no need to serve
the warrant since she was at that time already in custody.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Let me see if I have this straight. A woman
was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no
warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there
was no need to sign it or go to a judge because</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Technically…yes.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Extraordinary steps were necessary because we
were dealing with an extraordinary situation! Is it our fault that we
were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No. In
light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn’t begin to wonder if
there was something wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Because she questioned you.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Because she wouldn’t listen, because she
insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best
left to qualified officers, because –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Because she was fighting for the life of her
son! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable
time denying you had done anything wrong!</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: And in the end, that’s what happened, isn’t
it? At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died
along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in
Wineville. Is that correct, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: – so after much effort, we were able to
identify this boy, who was has been responsible for so much recent
trouble, as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between this, and the
arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real Walter Collins, we
have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los
Angeles. I hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space
to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare
occasions.</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce
you to the boy’s real mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I hope he hasn’t been too much trouble for
you.</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: Oh, no, not at all….</p>
<p><strong>wright</strong>: Mrs. Hutchins…Mrs. Collins, the woman he was
staying with, wanted him to have these. They’re the clothes she let him
wear.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, thank you. Isn’t that nice, Arthur?
Tell the nice officer thank you.</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: I don’t want ’em! Give ’em to somebody
else!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Precocious little fellow, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>“walter”</strong>: It’s not my fault! It was the police! They
said I was Walter Collins, not me! It wasn’t my idea!</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: There…blame the police for your own
mistakes. We’ve seen a lot of that lately, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m up here, Reverend.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: When Walter was…when he was here, I’d
walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if I couldn’t see
him, or hear him, I could…feel him in here.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Mothers and their children are
connected in amazing ways. My uncle joined the army during the big war,
and the day he died, before we ever heard a word about it, my
grandmother woke up in the middle of the night and said, “Bobby’s gone.”
She just…knew.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s why I don’t think Walter is dead.
I can still feel him, in this room.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: Mrs. Collins –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I know what the police said. But the
remains…what they found on that ranch is so…most of it can’t even be
properly identified. What if that boy made a mistake when he picked
Walter’s picture?</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: I understand that you don’t want to
accept this. What mother does? But you have to let go…and start over.
For yourself. He’d want you to move on.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Maybe. And maybe he’d want me to keep
looking. Maybe he’s waiting for me, somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: He is, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>rev. briegleb</strong>: We should go.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: This meeting will now come to order.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: This Committee has now heard all of the
testimony, and in light of the facts presented, issues the following
statement.</p>
<p><strong>int. courtroom - day</strong>: Where Northcott stands before
the judge, jury, and the grieving family members.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: While the City Council has no power to
directly remove commissioners or</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Bailiff, will you bring me the verdict of the
jury?</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: Second, we recommend that the suspension of
Captain Jones be made permanent.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will the defendant please rise?</p>
<p><strong>thorpe</strong>: Third, that steps be taken to investigate a
change in the prevailing laws and procedures by</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You may read the verdict.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We the jury find the defendant, Gordon
Stewart Northcott…guilty on all counts of murder in the first
degree.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Does the defendant wish to make a statement
before judgment is passed?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah, I want to make a statement. I want to
make it real clear that I never once got a fair shake from you, your
“honor,” or this court. The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her
– – ’cause she’s the only one never badmouthed me to the press. She
understands what it is when the police frame you for something you
didn’t do and throw you in the hole. Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I never
killed your boy. I –</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That’s enough! Counsel, you will get control
of your client or I will have him bound and gagged.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the judgment
of this court that you will be conveyed to San Quentin Prison, where you
will be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years, until
October 2nd, 1930. On that date, you are to be hanged by the neck until
dead. May god have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: – no, as I said after the hearing, I
have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles
Police Department. I will not resign. I will fight to the finish. The
Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been
trying to have me removed for some time, and I –</p>
<p><strong>chief davis</strong>: – anyway, I remain confident that the
Mayor’s office will stand firmly behind me. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ten minute break?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: You know…one of these days you might
consider actually taking one of these ten minute breaks. Might be good
for you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We’ll see. Thanks, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, we
spoke yesterday about my son…fine, thank you. I was wondering if you’d
had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case
anyone resembling Walter had – I see. No, thank you, I appreciate the
information. Would it be all right if I called you again, in a month or
so? Thank you. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Mrs. Collins.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, hello, I was just –</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: I know. That’s…why I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: It’s about Walter. We had…well, we received a
very strange telegram.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: From who?</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Gordon Northcott. He’s…he’s asked to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: He said he knows you’re still looking for your
son, and before he dies – He says that he lied when he testified that he
didn’t kill Walter. He’s willing to finally admit that he did it. He
says that if you come up to see him, in person…he’ll tell you the truth,
to your face…so that you can get on with your life and have some
peace.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: As you know, he’s set to be executed the day
after tomorrow at San Quentin, so…. You don’t have a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>hahn</strong>: Took me most of the morning to make all the
arrangements. Turns out you’re the first woman in thirty years the state
has allowed to visit a serial killer on the night of his execution.</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: I can stay in the room if you want,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, I’m…sure I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: All right…I’ll be right outside the
door if you need anything. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t suppose you’ve got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s where they do it, you know. That
building right over there.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s where they do what?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The hangings. Ten o’clock tonight, I get to
see what’s inside. I hear there’s thirteen steps going up to the
gallows…’cause thirteen is unlucky. Helps make sure you’re gonna go to
hell when you die. But I got ’em beat. I outsmarted ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: They’re gonna let me have whatever I want
for dinner. Got a steak coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes and green
beans. I always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing. One of
the other guys on Death Row said when you take the drop, you foul
yourself, and everything you ate…comes out the other end. So maybe
that’s why they make sure you got something in you when it happens. They
like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sure you don’t got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The warden, Clinton Duffy, he’s a good guy.
He’s writing a book about all the death sentences he’s carried out in
this place. Says it’s called “Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women.” Beats my
record all to hell.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mr. Northcott…you asked me to come to see
you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well,
I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah…yeah, you are. But see, the thing is, I
didn’t think you’d really come, and now –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I didn’t expect…. I don’t want to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I can’t do this…I can’t talk to you…not
today, not tonight, not with what they’re going to do to me. It’s one
thing to send a telegram, that’s easy, but right now, right here, in
person, I – I can’t tell you what you want to hear, Mrs. Collins. I
can’t, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Because I don’t want to die with a lie on my
lips!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I did my penance, I asked God to forgive me
for my sins…and I’ve been good, ever since…if I commit a sin now, if I
lie now…I’m out of time, I can’t be forgiven again… I don’t want to go
to hell –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mr. Northcott…look at me. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Did you…kill…my son?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Get away from me…I don’t know anything about
it!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mr. Northcott –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m innocent! Guard! Guard!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, wait, please –</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: It’s okay, ma’am, they always get a
little nuts the day of.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Did you kill him? Did you kill my
son?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mr. Northcott…Mr. Northcott!</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been
found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging. There
have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward
as stipulated under the laws of the State of California. Do you have any
last words?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No…nothing. I kept clean after I confessed,
reverend…just like I said I would.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Will it…will it hurt? Please…not so
fast…don’t make me walk so fast!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Thirteen steps…thirteen steps… but I didn’t
touch all of ’em, you bastards…I didn’t touch all of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: A prayer! Please, somebody, say a prayer for
me!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Silent night…holy night…all is calm…all is
bright…round yon virgin mother and child…holy infant so tender and mild
–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hey, Chris…we’re having an Oscar party
tonight at my apartment, you want to come?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I can’t…I’ve got a million forms to fill
out –</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: C’mon, please, they can wait –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sandy, you guys blew out the phone lines
between here and Baltimore, someone has to clean up the mess, and that’s
me. Besides, I’ve got a radio right here, I can follow the whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Positive. Go on, have fun.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I said I can’t go –</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: I’m meeting some friends for dinner at
Musso and Frank’s on Hollywood. They’re going to pipe the Oscar ceremony
through to the restaurant. Should be quite a night. I’d love it if you’d
come.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ben, that’s very sweet, and I wish I
could…but I really need to stay and finish this.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ben…? I put down two dollars on “It
Happened One Night” for best picture. Seems I’m the only one here who
thinks it has a chance against “Cleopatra.” If I win, how about we have
dinner tomorrow night to celebrate?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: You’ve got a deal, Christine. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: How about I call you if you win?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>irwin s. cobb</strong>: Thank you. And now, it gives me
distinct honor to present the category of Best Picture for 1934.</p>
<p><strong>irwin s. cobb</strong>: The nominees are “The Gay Divorcee,”
“Here Comes the Navy,” “The Barrets of Wimpole Street,” “One Night of
Love,” “The Thin Man,” “Cleopatra” –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Over-rated….</p>
<p><strong>irwin s. cobb</strong>: “Viva Villa,” “The White Parade,” and
“It Happened One Night.”</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert. I rest my
case.</p>
<p><strong>irwin s. cobb</strong>: And the Oscar for Best Picture goes
to…. “It Happened One Night.”</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I knew it…I knew it! I told you so!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ben, it looks like dinner is on me,</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No, of
course I remember you, how are you? Is everything –</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: When? Where did they – No, of course…I’ll
be right there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clay</strong>: I wanted to go to him right off, but they
said it was important to talk to him alone first.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Are they sure it’s –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. clay</strong>: They’re sure, but more important, I’m
sure. It’s my boy, all right…it’s David. He’s alive, Christine. They
found him up in Hysperia.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But how –</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: All right, so after you got into the car,
what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They drove me around for a long time, then we
ended up at this ranch –</p>
<p><strong>shut up!</strong>: I’ll see you boys later….</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Were there other boys present?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah…six, I think. It was a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Did you speak to them? Do you remember any
of their names?</p>
<p><strong>int. chicken coop - later</strong>: PANNING the boys huddled
against one wall, scared.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah…two of them were brothers, I think their
last name was Winslow, something like that. The oldest was Jeffrey, I
think he was around eleven…. …and Walter.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Do you remember his last name?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Collins.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: So if you only remember some of the names of
the rest, how come you remember his full name?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because of what happened.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Walter and Jeffrey were talking when
everybody else was screaming. They were scared, same as the rest of us,
but they weren’t scared stupid. They kept checking around until they
found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They figured we might be able to yank the
chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get
out of there and run… but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it
wasn’t wide enough, we’d be stuck. It might even bring the whole place
down.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We gotta try it!</p>
<p><strong>first winslow boy</strong>: No! What he hears –</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: We have to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>first winslow boy</strong>: I’m afraid!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not. I’m not afraid of anything. Don’t
you want to go home? Don’t you want to see your mom again?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Okay. Anybody who doesn’t want to come, get
over at that end in case this comes down.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: When we get out, we split up, go in
different directions, they can’t catch all of us. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Pull!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: And that’s the last you saw of him?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s the last I saw of any of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: So you don’t know if either of the other two
were captured?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. All I know is, if he hadn’t come back for
me…I don’t think I ever would’ve gotten out of there.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What happened after that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I hid in the woods for two days, too scared
to move, because I was sure they’d find me. I finally started walking,
but every time a car came up I was afraid it was them. So I kept off the
main roads until I saw a train stopped at a crossing, and I jumped
in.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Why didn’t you tell anyone what had
happened?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was afraid! I thought they’d come after me,
or my folks…so I didn’t tell anybody. I was on my own until I got a free
meal from this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told her I was an orphan, on my
own. She said I could stay on, and…I did. Every night, I’d wake up,
thinking they were right outside my window. Then I heard the police
talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and I thought,
for sure I can’t go back now.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Since I didn’t tell anybody what happened, I
was afraid they’d blame me for those kids being dead. So I just…stayed
away.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: So what made you come forward now, after all
this time?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I miss my mom…I miss my dad…I just…I just
want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: Still can’t believe it. Five years, case
closed, everyone thinks he’s dead…and there he is.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: You don’t think he’s still out there, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why not? Three boys made a run for it
that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the
others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid
to come home or identify himself, afraid he’d get into trouble, that
people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I
didn’t have before tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ybarra</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hope.</p>
