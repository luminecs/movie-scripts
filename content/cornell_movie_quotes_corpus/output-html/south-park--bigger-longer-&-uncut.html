as any white person’s!</p>
<p><strong>ticket guy</strong>: You have to be accompanied by a parent
or guardian.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: But why?</p>

and it might make you kids start using bad words.</p>

<p><strong>homeless guy</strong>: Uh, hi. I want five tickets to

may not be appropriate for your little ones.</p>
<p><strong>homeless guy</strong>: Oh. Hey, he says this movie isn’t
appropriate for you.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Look, homeless guy, if you don’t want to buy
us tickets, and NOT get your ten bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle
of Vodka and not forget about how miserable your life is and not stop
the voices in your head then go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>homeless guy</strong>: Five tickets please.</p>

<p><strong>stan</strong>: We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: That’s nice, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Woa, dude, who’s your girlfriend’s new
guy?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: She’s not my girlfriend, dude!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.
Who wants to touch me? I said, “Who wants to touch me?!”</p>
<p><strong>small boy</strong>: Oooooh…</p>
<p><strong>mr. hat</strong>: Okay, children, let’s take our seats.</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: We have a lot to learn and precious
little time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
Sigfried and Roy?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison, it’s
Terrance and Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: Well, anyway… Today children, our
friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: That’s right, Mr. Garrison. The
environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I hate the environment.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dude, how can you hate the environment?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: ’Cuz, dude, it’s all sticky and airy and

word?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Fragile?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No, he’s talking about fuck, dude. You can’t

<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: Eric!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Dude, you just said fuck again.</p>

<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Wow, Cartman’s cool!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: He’s like Terrance and Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Fuckin’ a right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: How would you like to go to the
principal’s office?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: How would you like to gargle rat jiz?</p>
<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I said -</p>

<p><strong>stan</strong>: Now remember, don’t tell anybody we saw the
Terrance and Phillip movie!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, let’s swear we won’t tell!</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: I am VERY disappointed in you
boys! You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I’ve already called in your
parents, but first I want you to THINK about what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Principal Victoria, can I ask a
question?</p>
<p><strong>princpal victoria</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: What’s the big fucking deal?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: AGH!! I want to know where you
heard these horrific obscenities!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I’VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times
before…</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: Boys, I seriously doubt that
Mr. Garrison ever said- ‘Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker’
in school!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Oh, oh…</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: Thank you all for coming on such
short notice. As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s mother</strong>: This just isn’t like you,
Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What did my son say, Principal
Victoria? Did he say the S word?</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: No, it was worse than that…</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: The F word?!</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: No, worse. Here’s a short list
of the things they’ve been saying.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s mother</strong>: Oh dear God…</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What is ‘fisting’?</p>
<p><strong>cartman’s mother</strong>: That’s when the fist is inserted
into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>cartman’s mother</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Young man, you will tell Peincipal
Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I can’t dude! We all took a sacred oath, and
swore ourselves to secrecy!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Dude!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy
gevalt! Not again!</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: What is Terrance and
Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with
toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it
appears they have a movie and I’m positive it’s not suitable for
children!</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: Well, it looks like I’ll have to
send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this
before MORE children see ‘Terrance and Phillip’.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Everybody’s already fucking seen it.</p>
<p><strong>ms. cartman</strong>: Eric!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I’m sorry! I can’t help it!! That movie has
warped my fragile little mind.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Alright, boys, that’s enough. Get out
and let us adults speak.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: We must take action on this
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: Ooh yes. I think we’ll have to
give detention to those boys.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Forgive me for saying so, Principal
Victoria, but your methods are too… Shall we say… soft? As head of the
PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: Article 42! You don’t
mean-?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is
impeaching you.</p>
<p><strong>principal victoria</strong>: But I-</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: You are officially relieved of your
duties as principal of this school!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Get out of that chair! The PTA is in
charge now!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Attention students. We are now
enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and
Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a
Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: HOOORAY!!!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: All over America, kids are flocking to
the R rated film, ‘Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire’. Here with a
special report, is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini.</p>
<p><strong>q. midget w/bikini</strong>: Thanks, Tom. It appears that the
effects of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching indeed. All over
America, children seem to be influenced.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Alright, this is for the silver medal.
Spell ‘Forensics’.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have to
spell forensics?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S, FORENSICS.</p>
<p><strong>clown</strong>: Hey kids, how would you like to see some
magic tricks?!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: FUCK YOU!!</p>
<p><strong>clown</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red
nose.</p>
<p><strong>child 2</strong>: Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck
your gay pants.</p>
<p><strong>q. midget w/bikini</strong>: And the devastating impact of
the Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and Phillip’s new hit song, “Shut
Your Fucking Face, Unclefucka” which has climbed the charts with a
bullet –</p>
<p><strong>terrance &amp; phillip</strong>: <b>Shut your fucking face!
Unclefucka!!</b></p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Thanks, midget. Shocking report. The
controversy surrounding the Terrance and Phillip movie began in the
small mountain town of South Park, Colorado where the local PTA banned
the movie. With us tonight is the head of the South Park PTA, Sheila
Brofloski-</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids
seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Canada!</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Alright. Here with a counterpoint is
the Canadian Minister of Movies.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Thank you, Minister, for joining
us.</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: Thanks for having me,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: Minister, parents all over America are
concerned about your country’s entertainment. Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: Well, the film is R
rated, and it’s not intended for children-</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Oh but OF COURSE children are going
to see it!!</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: Uh, can I finish? Can I
finish? …The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your
outrage-</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: YOU JUST DON’T CARE!</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: Can I finish? Hello?
Can I finish? …The United States has graphic images of violence on
television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
caught on tape? We can’t believe that a movie with some foul language
and fart jokes would piss you off so much.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: BECAUSE IT’S EVIL!!</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: Can I finish? Please?
Can I finish? … … Uh… Okay, I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: But minister, it isn’t like this film
is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada. Let us not forget
Brian Adams a few decades ago.</p>
<p><strong>canadian minister of movies</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: The Canadians are just mad that we
mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them! Like
it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your
Canadian smut!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Well, Terrance I hope you learned
something from this whole experience.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
boner biting dick fart fuck face!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
Lights?</p>

<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stan… I think you and I need some time
apart.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: It’s just… It’s obvious that we don’t have a
whole lot in common anymore. I need somebody who’s… a little deeper.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: But Wendy, I can go-</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No. Don’t speak. You’ll only make things more
annoying. Goodbye, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dude, anybody who doesn’t think Terrance and
Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.</p>

<p><strong>stan’s mother</strong>: I agree! <b>Something must be done!
We must take action fast! My child used to say ‘please and thank you’
Now he says suck my ass!</b></p>
<p><strong>kenny’s mother</strong>: But what are we going to do against
the media machine? It’s so big and powerful!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Right! And we can use that same media
machine to exploit OUR cause! We’ve got to let the whole world know what
the Canadians did to your son!</p>
<p><strong>parents</strong>: Yeah!!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: COME ON!</p>
<p><strong>parents</strong>: <b>Something must be done! Something’s

<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh.</p>

<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It isn’t fair!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan

<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: THIS must be him, officer! This is
the scum that sold R rated tickets to children!</p>
<p><strong>ticket guy</strong>: What?! Jesus Christ, I didn’t mean

<p><strong>officer barbrady</strong>: You can explain downtown!</p>
<p><strong>ticket guy</strong>: Oh shit! Hey it’s not MY fault! You

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Hello, Conan!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Hello, Brooke Shields!</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: It’s nice to have you here in America.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all,
we thought what the hell!</p>
<p><strong>conan o’brian</strong>: So guys… I understand you have a

<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Cheers, Terrance!</p>
<p><strong>conan o’brian</strong>: So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
question…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I just farted Terrance back into the stone
age!</p>
<p><strong>brooke shields</strong>: I farted once on the set of Blue
Lagoon!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!</p>
<p><strong>conan o’brian</strong>: Terrance and Phillip… Whose idea was
it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie? <u>Who is
responsible</u> <u>for that?</u></p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Phillip, I think our friend Conan has been
working too hard.</p>
<p><strong>conan o’brian</strong>: Say it! It was YOUR idea to have
someone light a fart on fire in your movie!</p>
<p><strong>phillip/terrance</strong>: It was our idea to have someone
light a fart on fire in your movie.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: That’s it! Move, move, move!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Terrance and Phillip, you are under
arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT
YOU!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dude, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Phillip, we’ve been tricked and ambushed
by The Conan O’Brian Show!!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: This little scrotum sucker willfully
deceived us! You are a bad man!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: And you call yourself a Canadian! I told
you we should of done Leno!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Don’t listen to them, Mr. O’Brian.
They’re master manipulators. You did a good job.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: You loved our movie, Conan! We watched it
together. You… You laughed!</p>
<p><strong>conan o’brian</strong>: What have I done?!!!</p>
<p><strong>brooke shields</strong>: AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
AAAGHGH!!!!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: You see what your filth has
caused?</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: US?! This is your mess, outraged
mother!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and
Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Our moms suck!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: This could mean… No more Terrance and
Phillip - EVER!</p>
<p><strong>canadian ambassador</strong>: As The Canadian Ambassador, I
hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and
Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>canadian ambassador</strong>: We demand their release
IMMEDIATELY!! As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of
Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
recession!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: If I may?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: As president and founder of M.A.C., I
would like to state-</p>
<p><strong>united nations head</strong>: Excuse me, M.A.C.?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Yes, Mothers Against Canada.</p>
<p><strong>united nations head</strong>: Kay.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: I would like to state that Canada
must learn to stop infiltrating our country with its graphic art!</p>
<p><strong>canadian ambassador</strong>: Last time I checked America was
a free country!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: This woman’s child was KILLED by your
country’s humor! Look how upset she is!</p>
<p><strong>canadian ambassador</strong>: We will continue to sell
Terrance and Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough to buy it!!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Then you leave me no choice… I call
for an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: What the hell do you mean I can’t get
Cheesy Poofs?!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian export.
We can’t carry them any more.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Who the hell made up that law?!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: You can’t do this!! Have you ever HAD
Cheesy Poofs? They’re a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar
crunch.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s nothing I can do. I can still sell you
Cheese-o’s.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Come on, you guys… We have to THINK!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole
thing has gone too far!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t really think you need Cheesy- Poofs,
tubby-</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Boys, we have to have a difficult
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We already know what you did. We saw it on
television.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>stan’s mother</strong>: Stanly, you’re too young to
understand what’s good for you. That’s why we mothers have taken
charge.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: But they fucking didn’t do anything wrong!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Yeah! And what rim job expert went and
outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What was that word, young man!?</p>
<p><strong>cartman’s mother</strong>: Oh, he said rim job. It’s when
someone licks your ass for-</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: I know what it is!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Lick someone’s ass?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: The Terrance and Phillip movie has
obviously done irreparable damage to their brains. We have to put them
in rehab right away.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: You boys need help. There are rehab
centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to
bad language.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s mother</strong>: There are?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Well no, I guess not… But we will
establish the first of its kind right here in South Park. All the
children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the
school counselor Mr. Mackey! Ooh I just love when I get these sorts of
ideas!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Why? So you can fuck up our life some
more?</p>
<p><strong>cartman’s mother</strong>: Eric! Don’t talk to Ms. Brovlofski
that way!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: But mom! I’m not fucking addicted to
fucking bad language! I don’t have a fucking problem!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mphrmo?</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: MPHR!! MMLY MMT!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Fallen one… We have such sights to show
you!</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I am Satan. I am your God, now.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: MPH RM!!!</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Come with me. I will show you what delightful
pain awaits.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: MMMMMPHPHP!!!!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to
hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: You remember… Saddam Hussein, don’t you?!</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: MMMPPH!!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mkay, it’s come to my attention, that
you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay. Now the sooner you recognize
your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade
homeroom where you belong.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: But they’re just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
parents are over-reacting.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Yeah, Wendy’s here, and she doesn’t even like
Terrance and Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Ugh… You guys, seriously… I’m having Cheesy
Poof withdrawal…</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mkay, kids from all over the State have
been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young
man… Let’s start with you.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: My name is Gregory… And I have a potty
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: You’ve got a stupid accent too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Eric, that is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: What? Fuck French people. Fuck ’em in the
ear.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
what I’m talking about. We have to change the way you think.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: How are you gonna do that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: There are times when you get suckered
in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en. But it’s when you do these
things too much <b>That you’ve got to clear your head and get back in
touch…</b></p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Come on, kids! Sing along!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: <b>You can do it, it’s all up to you mkay?
With a method, there’s nothing you can’t do, mkay? We don’t have to
spend our lives addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand-
jobs for cash</b></p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: It’s easy, Mkay?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What the hell do they think this is?!
Summer camp?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Uh, we’re just, starting our
program…</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: This is NOT a place for fun and
games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to
go to!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mkay.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Tom I’m standing in front of the U.S.
Supreme Court where the most important trial of the - day - is
happening. Thousands of people have shown up from all over the country
to show their outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me now is
Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the
Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate
the Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>kenny’s mother</strong>: Yes, yes I do, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Did you ever think you would see the
day when thousands of people were wearing your son Kenny on
T-shirts?</p>
<p><strong>kenny’s mother</strong>: No I didn’t. But if any of you would
like one they’re 14.95. Available in blue or white.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Well, we can only imagine the
intense, vehement trial that is going on inside.</p>
<p><strong>johnny cochran</strong>: Terrance and Phillip… You knowingly,
with malice of forethought were trying to destroy American culture, yes
or no?</p>
<p><strong>johnny cochran</strong>: YES OR NO!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Shh! Mr. Mackey’s gonna hear us!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: The Americans are just showing their TRUE
COLORS as smelly bastards.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Fight the power!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: The young boy that died lit himself on
fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Don’t believe the hype!!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Yeah! WooHoo!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: You cannot oppress us! We will continue to
pursue our art. We know there are Americans out there who will help
us!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Your ‘ART’ is shallow and immature!
We Americans do NOT allow that for our children!!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Please. You teach your children that
America is the land of the free. But it’s all bullshit. You’re one of
the most conservative countries in the world!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: The problem is you don’t allow your
children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective
bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they’ve
been lied to, and they resent you for it.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so
fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: THAT IS ENOUGH!!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors
YOU from the world.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: NO THEY DON’T!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: YES THEY DO! AND I’LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN
MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT-</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.</p>
<p><strong>canadian prime minister</strong>: ATTENTION AMERICA!! You
have taken our national treasure Terrance and Phillip. We, in turn, have
taken yours… The Smothers Brothers!</p>
<p><strong>canadian prime minister</strong>: I’ll let you catch your
breath… Now, release Terrance and Phillip, or else we will EXECUTE your
beloved Smothers Brothers!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy smothers</strong>: Please listen to them!!</p>
<p><strong>dick smothers</strong>: They’re not fucking around!!</p>
<p><strong>canadian prime minister</strong>: We’re not fucking around.
This is not aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is aboot freedom… This
is aboot respect. RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>canadian prime minister</strong>: Oh yeah… AND FUCK YOU,
AMERICA!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Okay kids, for today’s rehabilitation
activity, we’re going to watch the Terrance and Phillip movie.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Sweet!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Now, this is an EDITED version of the
movie, which was put out by the MPAA. That’s the Motion Picture
Association of America.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Isn’t that censorship?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: No the MPAA is NOT a censorship
group.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Uh… Because they say so… Mkay. Now I
want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out,
and notice how much better a movie it becomes…</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: HOORAY!!!</p>
<p><strong>dubbed phillip</strong>: Hey Terrance. I feel like I’m going
to pass gas near your head.</p>
<p><strong>dubbed terrance</strong>: I would rather you didn’t,
Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>dubbed phillip</strong>: Oh? Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Oh, you are such a maroon!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: You would know, dummy.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: You are pigeon-like in your
intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: So you see, the point and the theme of
the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn’t cut out any of
the graphic violence. What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Oh man, I’m gonna need a cherry pie to get
the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Eric, you’re not watching your
mouth!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful
cheddar crunch, and I’ll watch my fucking mouth!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Eric!!!! You need to be rehabilitated.
Help me to help you!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Help yourself prickfuck!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: How is the children’s progress?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Very encouraging. Most of the children
have been weened from their naughty mouths.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What do you mean MOST, why not
ALL?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Well, some of the children just don’t
respond to 12 step programs.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Then we’ll have to resort to plan B
and call the v-chip organization.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn’t been
fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: I don’t care if it’s dangerous!
Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need
to remind you of your situation.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Alright, I’ll make the call…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Madam foreman, have you reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: How find you, the jury?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We the jury, find the defendants… Terrance
and Phillip… GUILTY of being complete bastards.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: Oh oh, Phillip. You know what this
means?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: We’ll be farting bread and water for a few
years.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against the
great nation of America you are hereby sentenced to DEATH.</p>
<p><strong>terrance</strong>: DEATH?! You gotta be shittin’ me!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Aghgh!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Dude, let’s help Terrance and Phillip!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You raise awareness by distributing buttons,
stickers and leaflets.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: That’d be sweet! We could try to bring back
Cheesy Poofs!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, let’s make Free Terrance and Phillip
buttons!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You guys don’t even care. All you care about
is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart on each other more.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about
censorship.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Yes, what’s next? Barcodes on our forearms?
This country is the most fascist of all.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What the hell are you talking about, kid?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: You don’t get it Stan… You just don’t get
it.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What? What don’t I get? What don’t I get?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I don’t know, dude.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: That British dickhole is what’s taking Wendy
away from me!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I thought she wasn’t your girlfriend,
dude.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: She’s Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT
little asshole who’s fucking it up for me!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Mkay, children, you’ve all made terrific
progress, and are hereby done with the eight step program.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Thank God, that sucked ass.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Uh, except for you Eric. I’m afraid you
need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: The N word?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Norwegian Ass Raper.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: The rest of you are graduated. You can
go home today.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I don’t graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!
THIS IS BULLSHIT?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no…
Mkay.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: We’re protesting!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Well, boys, it might interest you to
know that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just bombed the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: They did?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Yes, at six this morning they bombed the
heck out of Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh. That doesn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: They only bombed Cleveland because we’re

<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start
getting political, I’ll throw your skinny little butt right back into
rehab. Mkay?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES

<p><strong>mr. mackey</strong>: No, Eric… I’m afraid it’s phase two for
you…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Prepare thyself for unending pain!
Unparalleled misery!!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Hey, relax Satan. Don’t get all
worked up. You’re gonna give yourself an ulcer again.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mrph mprph!!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: What? What do you mean you don’t
belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mrph mprhm mm rmph!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: A deal? You wanna make a deal with
the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o’ fun.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Saddam, would you let me do my job
please!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Hey relax, guy. Let’s see what the
kid wants.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Oh, you want out of hell, huh?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The
whole POINT of hell is that you don’t WANT to be here!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If
you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of
purchases from ‘Snacky Smores.’ They’re rich, chocolatey and really hit
the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we’ll grant you ANY WISH
YOU WANT.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mrph?</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: I wouldn’t bullshit you kid! Snacky
Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Well what are you waiting for pal?!
Get to it!</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I don’t see why you have to belittle me in
front of people like that.</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Hey, relax guy. It’s just a cruel
joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth.
He’ll never get ’em, see?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Sometimes I just think you don’t have any
respect for me.</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Hey, come here, guy.</p>
<p><strong>saddam hussein</strong>: Who’s my cream puff?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Is that a new pearl bracelet,
Mrs. McKormick?</p>
<p><strong>kenny’s mother</strong>: Why yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: As our next official order of
business here at M.A.C., we will test the new V- chip. As most of you
know, the V-chip was created to lock children out of watching certain
shows on television. And now the N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
product that they can tell us all about. Here is the Surgeon General,
Dr. Pangloss.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Thank you, parents.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: The machinery of the new ‘V-chip’
is very simple, and similar to that of the V- chip. The chip is placed
just under the subject’s skin, where it emits a small but painful shock
of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered.</p>
<p><strong>stan’s father</strong>: Now wait a minute, are you telling us
that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid is swearing?</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: It’s just like a lie detector.
Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the
chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: We are very excited to see the
results of this test. Patient 453, would you step out here, please?</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Patient 453 here has been fitted
with the new v-chip…</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: My head hurts.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Don’t worry about that. Now, I want
you to say ‘Doggy.’</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Doggy.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Notice that nothing happens. Now
say ‘Montana.’</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Montana.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Good. Now ‘Pillow’.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Pillow.</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Alright, now I want you to say
‘horsefucker.’</p>
<p><strong>cartman’s mother</strong>: Go ahead, it’s alright, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Horsefuck-</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: OW!! YOU CAN’T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN’T
FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE–</p>
<p><strong>doctor pangloss</strong>: Success!! Our device works
perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: And so we have succesfully removed
the Canadian smut from all of our children’s brains. We have made
changes at school to ensure that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to
smut!!!!!!! It’s OVER!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hi Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hi Stan.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass

school.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: NAZIS!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What’s the matter, Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Nothing, Stan. You wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: God damn it, why does she keep saying
that?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I’m so sick of these soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah, they suck.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I know. Always saying, do this, do that.
They think they’re so cooool. Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler! OW!!!</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Hello there, children!!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Hey, Chef.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: How would like some Salisbury Steak with

<p><strong>stan</strong>: To free Terrance and Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: But you guys… It’s Salisbury steak.</p>

<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: I never thought there would be war

Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in
anticipation of an attack.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: What about air strikes?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: We have to have air strikes on their
military and entertainment centers. It’s the only way to ensure that
their smut can’t reach American soil!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh, uh… I don’t know if air strikes are
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s mother</strong>: Not necessary?! Mr. President, may I
remind you that our country’s heart and soul are at stake, and our
children’s minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to
fight us because we won’t tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is
war they want… THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!</p>

<p><strong>stan</strong>: Uhh…</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Terrance and Phillip are currently being
held at a Canadian Internment camp two kilometers outside of town. They
are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show for the
troops.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: We must sneak into the camp through this
duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip inside… The war is escalating, and
the American forces are preparing for a large scale attack on Canada.
That means the time is now…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Wow, dude, Wendy’s new guy is smart.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: This is a dangerous mission, so I’ll go

Terrance and Phillip! We’re going!</p>

<p><strong>mr. garrison</strong>: Boy, I can’t wait for our first shore-

<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: PAY ATTENTION!</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: It’s no secret that the Evil
Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United
State. We have brought you here because you ar America’s best, and last
hope.</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Oh… Apparently you’re not the best,
you’re simply the last. Anyway, let’s strategize… Map!</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Our sources have told us that the
Canadians might try to attach tomorrow’s USO show and stop us from
executing Terrance and Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Now each battalion has a specific
code- name and mission. Battalion 5, raise your hands-</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: You will be the all-important first
defense wave, which we will call ‘Operation Human Shield’.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Hey, wait a minute…</p>

Shield’ will suffer heavy losses. But don’t lose your spirit men! Stay
until the bitter end. Battalion 14?</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Right, you are ‘Operation Get
Behind The Darkies’. You will follow Battalion 5 here-</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: -and try not to get killed for
God’s Sake. Are there any questions men?</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Yes soldier?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
Proclamation?</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: I don’t listen to hip-hop.</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: If you somehow live, we will
regroup on this hill outside–</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Now what’s wrong with this
thing?</p>

FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET!!!</p>
<p><strong>bill gates</strong>: It is faster, over five million–</p>
<p><strong>general plymkin</strong>: Alright men, get lots of rest, and
prepare thyselves for battle!</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: …after you clear this zone here, rendezvous
behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You are indeed brave, but you will need
someone who’s done this sort of thing before. MOLE!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oui?</p>

sex. But it took me so long to figure that out.</p>

<p><strong>satan</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: He said that his wish is for everyone who died
in the war to come back.</p>

chance for YOU not to be dead…</p>

as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But
you Kenny, must remain dead.</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: Mph rm.</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: I must admit, I’m kind of relieved. It’s too
fucking cold up here.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Aren’t there cold parts of hell?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Yeah, but it’s a real dry cold. Here it’s the
humidity that gets me. I guess I’m destined to live in hell… alone…</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Hello… What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>satan</strong>: Hi there, little guy… Would you like to go to
hell with me?</p>

<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.

is just stupid… You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you
forgot the most important thing… To love each other.</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: Yeah! You’re all a bunch of stupid sons a
bitches!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Mom, I’m a man. Just a man. And I’m going to

cream?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
cream?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: My friend the clitoris told me.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Wow, I have a clitoris too.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It’s
huge.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: But Wendy… What about Gregory?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Stan, I never cared for Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: <b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is
everything I’d ever hoped for-</b></p>
