<p><strong>nutrition clerk</strong>: Lincoln Six-Echo… Options are dried
fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What? No bacon?</p>
<p><strong>nutrition clerk</strong>: You got a sodium flag, pal - now
what’s it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln ! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hello , stranger.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: What? You don’t recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: It’s just an expression, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now sit
down and ask me where I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Okay, Ester. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: At the medical center. Just for tests but
they had me on liquid nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Exciting.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: That’s not the exciting part. I got my first
trimester report: happy, healthy and contaminant-free… Both of us.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Us?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: My baby… It’s in perfect condition. I just
hope I can keep it that way. I still have six months to delivery.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Then you leave all this behind, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Why? Will you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’ll miss your coffee. C’mon, I already
burned up my quota.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Okay. But this is the last time.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Good morning. To everyone here and everyone
watching on etherscreen, welcome to the community address. Today I’m
coming to you from Sector Four. For those of you here with sugar quotas,
let me recommend the french toast. I just tried some and it’s excellent,
really. But I know what everyone’s hungry for s o let’s move on to the
lottery. As always the draw will be made from our host sector. So tell
me, Sector Four - is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Let The Spin begin.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well , Starkweather, if you’re watching on
etherscreen - your time has come, my friend! You’re moving out to The
Island! And the rest of you, never lose hope; what do we know about The
Daily Spin?</p>
<p><strong>the younger residents</strong>: Everyone gets to win!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: An d tomorrow it could be you…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Don’t worry. Your time will come.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: That’s easy for you to say. Your time’s
guaranteed. All you have is six months.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Six months of mood swings, sore back and
swollen feet. Want to trade places?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Give me some more of your coffee.</p>
<p><strong>- - next stop… sector 5 - sector 6 - centerville…</strong>:
At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the
residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus is drawn
to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.</p>
<p><strong>resident #1</strong>: A stim unit says it hits the wall.</p>
<p><strong>resident #2</strong>: Okay . But I get to set the can.</p>
<p><strong>resident #1</strong>: Hurry it up. The shuttle’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed. Match
to vacancy; 171, Sector 5. Request clearance to populate.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Hey, you want to know something?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You know that guy who won the Spin in your
sector? Starkweather?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I had a bout with him last week. Guess how
long he’s been here? Six months.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Six months?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You don’t believe me - look it up.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What do you say now? Still think The Spin’s
rigged for the long haulers?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: He got lucky, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And don’t you wish it was you… out there on
The Island… nature’s own clean air zone… no screening, no quotas…
unlimited pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Shut up, Jonesy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Why don’t you make me? In the ring.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You’re out of my weight-class.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Not anymore. They just got the new program in
- multi-weight balancing.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: C’mon, champ. A stim unit says you won’t last
three rounds.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Whoooooo!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sure you input the right weight class?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You’re just too slow, Jonesy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You’re faster `cause you’re lighter.
Programmers… they always miss something.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hey, you put up, now pay up.</p>
<p><strong>- - new at the pleasure center!… or try a mystery
date!…</strong>: At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each
swipe their ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the
readout-</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units.
Your friend, he’s got an alcohol flag.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So make it a beer and a Vita Cola.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You know, you’re going to get yourself
contaminated one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Shut up, Jonesy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So, you up for a rematch tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I can’t. I got an interact.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: With who? That blonde again?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hey, it’s an authorized interaction. We’re
on the same meditation program.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You want to get flagged for proximity?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No law against friendship, Jonesy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Quick . . . Give me that beer back.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s going on, officer?</p>
<p><strong>censor 1</strong>: Census check.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What happened? You lost count?</p>
<p><strong>censor 1</strong>: I hope nobody’s drinking off-quota.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Vita Cola all the way, officer.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Accept.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln? I missed you at breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I guess I overslept.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I just wanted to check we’re still on for
tonight. The interact.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Right. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I’ll see you then. Enjoy your day!</p>
<p><strong>13 int . nutrition plaza - sector four - day</strong>:
Ravel’s Pavane plays overhead. The plaza is emptying as residents leave
for work. Lincoln arrives at the service counter. He swipes his
ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Just juice today. I’m late for work.</p>
<p><strong>nutrition clerk</strong>: Too bad. I gotta serve the full
meal.</p>
<p><strong>kleinwort</strong>: No, no, no. Use your own sugar quota.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: C’mon, Kleinwort…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: So what’s up with the Censors, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kleinwort</strong>: They’re conducting a census check. Or
don’t you watch the bulletins?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I know what it is. I’ve just never seen
them out in this sector before.</p>
<p><strong>kleinwort</strong>: Probably just tracking a glitch. A bad
scanner or maybe an userware defect. Ethercuffs. They get damaged, you
get a false read. Sometimes even a dropout.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What are you saying? They lost someone?</p>
<p><strong>kleinwort</strong>: Someone just isn’t showing up where they
should be. What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Accomodation Status : 102, Sector 4.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hey , Jonesy. Remember the guy who won The
Spin yesterday? His apartment’s still showing as occupied.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: So you get 24 hours to move out.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Maybe the system didn’t update yet.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No. It updates on the hour. If he’s gone it
should be showing a vacancy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What? You think he’s still here? The guy wins
a place on The Island and you think he just decided not to go?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know. He wasn’t there to step up.
And now there’s a census check…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And now nothing. It’s probably the
programmers messing up.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: A stim unit says I can prove it. Cross
reference with sanitation.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Sanitation Status: 102, Sector Four.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: See ? Standard procedure. They got to sweep
it for the next occupant.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: If you gentlemen aren’t busy… Perhaps I
could get an update on sector six?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Still in the electrical phase, sir.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Well the guys upstairs are griping about
the backlog. So go over there and light some fires, will you?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting something? Or do
you want to get contaminated?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: Sorry, chief. I can’t let you get any
closer. We got live wires over there.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: What’s that you said?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I said I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: He y , you get yourself contaminated, don’t
come pointing the finger at me.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: How are you doing, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: You know how it is.
<code>Gets to the end of shift,</code>crew starts draggin t h e i r
feet.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We l l the guys upstairs are griping about
the backlog. They want to know when you’ll be ready for move in.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: I guess if we bust our backs, we could be
out of here by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’ll tell them two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: Thanks , chief. I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: So . . . got any stuff on you today?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I t ’ s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: T h a t your shift’s almost over.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: You mean, these things? Well, these things
ain’t good for you anyways.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The y taste good.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I like coming here. Talking. Most outsiders
don’t like to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: That’s because we ain’t supposed to. They
got rules about fraternization.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What do you do when the shift’s over?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto the
disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: H u m p `n dump crew?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy
stuff to a site on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Is it as bad as they say out there?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The air… the containments.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: But not everywhere. Not on The Island.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: I don’t know too much about that.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: He y , take it from me, you got a sweet deal
right here. So why worry, huh?</p>
<p><strong>19 ext . the world outside - day</strong>: A i r blasts up
from a giant tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
and on behalf of our staff, I’d like t o welcome you to The Sanger
Institute.</p>
<p><strong>21 int . inner foyer - later</strong>: The crosshatch emblem
spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real screen but a projected flat
known as a “holoframe”. Here, Lydia assembles the tour group, nursing
wine glasses and canapes. The holoframe fades up a serene music track
and a commercial begins: A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on
a walking frame – a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast
flattened by a mastectomy – a young woman in labor, her face knotted in
pain. The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then-</p>
<p><strong>v o i c e</strong>: I t ’ s not a pretty sight, is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I t takes courage to confront mortality,
my friends. And I see it in each of y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger
and I’m here to reward your courage.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: T o d a y ’ s group is from New Gaza Health
Care. They’re with the platinum plan.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology
unit.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I t doesn’t get any prettier, does it?
But this is not a freakshow, my friends. This is a war museum. A history
of our battles with mortality… and defeats. Take the stem cell, for
instance. A bid to cultivate human parts for transplant - in rodents,
primates, barnyard animals. It’s enough to make your skin crawl. In some
cases literally, giving rise to a new range of cross-species viruses.
But that’s how we learn. From our mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
beginning, the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic
landmark- t o break the curse of heredity, to correct congenital defect…
genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science. A
bright future that led to a dark age and much of the legislation we know
today. But while the clone laws may have narrowed the field, science
marches on. Only to hit the same wall over and over again - the enigma
of growth, the alchemy that takes us from embryo to adult. A clone
barely reaches infancy before its growth enzymes misfire, resulting in
the kind of monstrosities - which are only effigies - you see here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: So what do we learn from our mistakes?
That human parts cannot grow outside a human body. That human bodies
cannot grow outside nature’s grand design.</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: S o what the hell are we doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: L e t ’ s say one day you go to your
doctor for a checkup. He discovers you have imminent renal failure and
require a kidney transplant. What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: I wouldn’t do nothing. My brother’d g
i v e me one of his. Or else.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: E v e n if your brother’s kidney is
with- o u t defect, there’s still a 38% chance of rejection. Or less if
he’s your twin.</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: He’s not. He’s older.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: But what if you did have a twin?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: What if you had a genetic double who’d
give you not just one of his kidneys, but both? In fact, any organ or
body part you ever had cause to need?</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: What ? You mean like a clone? I
thought you said all that stuff was a bust.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I said the problem with a clone is it
doesn’t survive infancy. The solution is to find a different starting
point. Why sow the seed when you can create the fruit? Or what we like
to call… an “agnate”.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: An agnate is sequenced from a point on
the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned post-maturate. It is `created’
adult.</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: L e t me see if I got this straight.
You can create this whatever… this walking spare parts holder… but I
gotta w a i t five years to get hold of em?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: The spare parts, as you put it, need to
be tested for integrity. But as many of our clients leave it till late
in life to take out the policy, we do offer the option for early
harvest. Given the risks, however, a waiver is required.</p>
<p><strong>t h e fat man</strong>: S o five years or no warranty? For
the premiums you’re asking?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: An d what if the organ you needed was a
heart? Ask yourself, each of you. If you had to put a price on your
life, your very survival - what would it be?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I t ’ s a question your insurance
company has already answered. For them, the agnate obviates costly and
ineffective treatment programs. Should you decide t o take out our
policy, not only will they lower your existing premiums but they’ll also
cover the production cost.</p>
<p><strong>t o u r member</strong>: This “agnate”… what happens to it?
After our friend here gets his kidney.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: That’s entirely his decision. Our role
is intermediary. We, as the insurance provider, guarantee the condition
and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained. In
legal terms, the policy holder is defined as a “sponsor”. The premiums,
in effect, becoming sponsorship payments, maintaining the agnate until
such time as harvest is required. At such time and where feasible, the
sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship, retaining the agnate for
secondary harvest or, shall we say, let the policy expire.</p>
<p><strong>t o u r member</strong>: E x p i r e ? You mean… let it
die?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: N o . Not as you and I know it, at
least. The associations of life and death are no more applicable to an
agnate than to a cow in a field. It exists in a state of limited
consciousness - aware not of life but of functionality. Imbued with the
knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question
it. And yet, in many ways, the end if the most humane part of the
process. The agnate goes to harvest without any fore- b o d i n g and is
painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came. Eternal or
otherwise. There is mortality for an agnate. Just utility and
redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>t o u r member</strong>: S o it doesn’t know? It doesn’t know
its… its p u r p o s e in life?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: W h o does know my friend? Who among us
knows our true purpose in life?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: This month we’re offering a special rate for
new sponsors. Including a 10% discount on the his-and-hers plan.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: DR. SANGER? Would you like to close?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Yes . . . Now some of you may be
thinking this commercial is staged. But these are not actors, these are
past customers. Real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of
sponsorship. What we offer here at The Sanger Institute is not just
health insurance but indemnity. What we offer is the chance of a new
lease on life…</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: N o w Lydia will walk you through the
rest of the tour and explain the various limitations and exclusions. But
I do have time for a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>t h e wasp</strong>: The commercial. The girl with the baby.
What is that? A fix for infertility?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: You mean the maternity plan? No. N o t
endemic infertility at least. As I said, the law prohibits genetic
alteration so a defect endemic in a sponsor will also be present in
their agnate. No, what the maternity plan provides is a way round the
risks and rigors of childbirth. Under this plan, an agnate becomes
eligible for pregnancy shortly after foundation. A simple donation of
sperm from the father, then the agnate is fertilized and brings your
baby to term.</p>
<p><strong>the wasp</strong>: An d then what? You get it in the
mail?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: F o r practical reasons, delivery is
handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .</p>
<p><strong>t h e wasp</strong>: An d “the agnate” - what happens to it?
When it’s, you know - delivered.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: The same rule applies. You can continue
your sponsorship. Or not. And in this case, there’s a natural window for
compliance as the agnate is routinely sedated after delivery. As to
whether it wakes up from that sleep, like I said, the choice is
yours…</p>
<p><strong>t h e wasp</strong>: An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks,
right?</p>
<p><strong>23 ext . processing plant</strong>: A i r blasts up from the
same giant tunnel, swallowing the laughs.</p>
<p><strong>26 int . director’s office - centerville</strong>: A glass
wall looks down on the avenue. The furniture is trans- p a r e n t ,
ethereal. Merrick sits at a console desk studying an etherboard. O f f a
buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and Lincoln enters, composing a
deadpan. He doesn’t like this man.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes . Please, take a seat.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: How ’ s Lincoln Six-Echo today?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: E v e r y t h i n g going okay?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I f I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m not sure I deserve such a negative
association. My job’s only to see that you’re happy. That everything’s
okay.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I t sounds like you don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Why wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I t ’ s part of your makeup. To challenge
things. To question what’s around you.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility
by helping me solve a little puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You’re doing well in most areas - pro- f i
c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously, your last medical puts you in
excellent condition. But screening’s picked up some deviations. Trace
levels, changes in your sleep pattern… I see you’ve also been burning up
your quotas…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: A r e you saying I’m contaminated?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The n what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When
someone starts straying from those parameters, we need to find out
why.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Because you - not just you, all of our
residents - are special. Because people like me don’t get to go to The
Island.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: S o tell me, have you noticed any changes
in yourself?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: What about your sleep pattern? You feel
you’ve been sleeping properly?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: L e t me put it another way, when you wake
up, do you feel… disrupted?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Disrupted?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: They’re all words in your vocabulary. I
know you understand what they mean.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like
you want more than you’re given?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Do you have any difficulty staying focused?
At work, for instance?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: H a v e you been experiencing feelings,
sensations you don’t quite understand?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Do you sometimes feel agitated for no
apparent reason? Frustrated, angry…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: An g r y ? You feel angry?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: When exactly do you feel angry?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m going to order some tests at The
Medical Center. In the meantime, I’d like you to stay away from
stimulants - protein, sugar, caffeine…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I already burned up my quotas.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: But I know you can get around them.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m asking you to cooperate. Not for my
sake, Lincoln, but for your own.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The r e is one other thing. You have a
female friend. “Ester”. Your file shows you’ve been interacting
regularly.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The r e ’ s no law against friendship.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: O f course not. We encourage interaction in
the hope it’ll be of mutual benefit. But given these deviations… let’s
just say proximity becomes an issue.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I know the rules of proximity.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The rules of proximity apply to sexual
contact, Lincoln. In this case it goes deeper than that. Ester is
entering h e r second trimester. A time of change and emotional
confusion. Further inter- a c t i o n might be… unhealthy for you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: An d for Ester - well, she has only six
months left to delivery. Then she’ll move out to The Island and whatever
ties she has here will be broken.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: G o o d . Now I’m also going to refill your
pleasure quota. It may help to settle you down a little.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Thank you. I feel much better now.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I’m not sure you do. But I think you’ll do
what’s right, Lincoln. You may not trust me. But I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: S o r r y I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I t ’ s okay. I was waiting to tell you
something anyway. Guess what?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: M y baby - I felt it move. And it’s the
weirdest feeling too. I can’t explain it. It’s like being more… more h e
r e .</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m all excited and we’re supposed
to be finding peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I have to cancel, Ester.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: S o I’ll see you at breakfast tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Did I do something wrong, Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: K a r l . . . Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I forgot how much I hate the air here.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system’s
readjusting to the sterile environment.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I t ’ s the smell I hate. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Yes , well I cut short your leave for a
reason. I take it you’ve been briefed?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: O n e of our lab rats is missing.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He
dropped off the ether two days ago. At first we thought it was a system
error. Then we found this in a garbage chute.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: D e l t a generation, huh?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I t was a Delta the last time.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: T h a t was entirely different. The product
suffered a head injury.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: What happened to this one?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We don’t know. He just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: N o t easy to disappear. Unless he figured a
way through the boundary.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: He’s a code two, Karl. A low
functioner.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I f you ask me, it’s a mistake giving them
any functions at all.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The y don’t function mentally, they don’t
function physically - you know that.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: The n perhaps if you’re going to breed lab
rats, you should breed them tame.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I f you bothered to read the clone laws,
you’d realize we have no choice in the matter. The virtual humanity
statutes accord them a set of freedoms. All we can do is prescribe the
limits. And even those are subject to regulation. Scope of knowledge,
range of activity, even their speech patterns. The law requires that
what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: You mean, like fallibility?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The ether shows no attempts on the
boundary. He’s here, Karl. But for some reason, your men seem unable to
find him. It’s your job to contain the products. I’d like you to do it,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: A little sensitive, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: J u s t after Starkweather went missing,
his sponsor placed an order. An order we can’t fill. Damn right I’m
sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: A l r i g h t . How much time do I have?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he
sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage. In medical
terms, we have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms, we’re already o n
borrowed time… An d Karl?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: R e v e r s e map. Crop to twelve hour
segments. Then put up a sub-grid.</p>
<p><strong>n u t r i t i o n clerk</strong>: Lincoln Six-Echo… Options
are dried fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I want some bacon.</p>
<p><strong>n u t r i t i o n clerk</strong>: You heard the options.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: An d coffee. I want coffee.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: This isn’t what I asked for.</p>
<p><strong>n u t r i t i o n clerk</strong>: You want to get into it?
Look, I just work here, pal. I serve the meal and make sure it goes down
on your record.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: P u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>starkweather</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>starkweather</strong>: P l e a s e , you have to help me…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: W h o are you? What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: S u b j e c t headed into North Quadrant.
Two- m a n teams - we block him and force him to ground. If you have a
shot, hook him but keep it above the belt. Management doesn’t want us to
“damage the product”.</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: E t h e r c o n ? Sector Four North;
code an exclusion for tri-key a c c e s s . Then give me a full quadrant
lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>a vertical onto a residential block</strong>: the grid of
crosswalks, the tiers of frosted facades; quiet, the residents still
dormant–</p>
<p><strong>a drum of footfalls</strong>: Then a figure breaking frame,
racing up the walkway of an upper floor; then another figure, in hot
pursuit –</p>
<p><strong>t h e lockdown i n i t i a t e s</strong>: the lights
shifting spectrum from white to ultraviolet, bathing the quadrant in a
lambent purple haze–</p>
<p><strong>s t a r k w e a t h e r</strong>: his eyes bulging with panic
as he races up the walkway, straining for an ethergate a t the far end
of the floor–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: his eyes charged with adrenaline, straining
to close ground on his assailant; oblivious to the building noise
of–</p>
<p><strong>t h e lockdown</strong>: locks hissing, lights flashing,
ripping up the row of frosted facades; sweeping past Lincoln and onward
toward–</p>
<p><strong>s t a r k w e a t h e r</strong>: the ripple of hissing locks
rushing up on him, he pours on the pace, sneering with effort as he
tries to outrace–</p>
<p><strong>t h e lockdown</strong>: the ripple spearing ahead of him to
the end of the floor; now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the
exit.</p>
<p><strong>s t a r k w e a t h e r</strong>: stalled by the realization
he’s trapped; he spins round, looking for another avenue of escape only
to find–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong
tackle; both men toppling over, hitting the floor with a bone-jarring
thud–</p>
<p><strong>s t a r k w e a t h e r</strong>: quick to recover, breaking
lose of entanglement; now struggling to his feet, stumbling onward up
the walkway–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: gets up to resume pursuit, then pauses,
spotting his ethercuff, discarded on the ground. He looks up in
confusion at–</p>
<p><strong>s t a r k w e a t h e r</strong>: a short distance ahead,
climbing over the walkway rail; launching himself off, into a seemingly
suicidal plummet–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: leaning over the rail, seeing his assailant
land safely on a crosswalk beneath, resuming his flight on the lower
floor as-</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: You asshole! You hooked the wrong one!</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: J u s t a flesh wound. `Hit his head pretty
hard. Possible concussion. T h i n k you can walk, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: You see this? It’ll get you past the
lockdown. You’re to report to The Medical Center. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>45 int . ether control room</strong>: S T A R K W E A T H E R
RUNNING. Meeting white uniforms at every turn, zig- z a g g i n g o v e
r crosswalks, down ramps. The rat in the maze, dumb to its inevitable
destination. Widening, we see we are watching the action on etherview,
racking and dollying like a deific e y e .</p>
<p><strong>e t h e r c o n</strong>: E a s t side team hold position.
Subject headed for the second floor crossramp.</p>
<p><strong>46 int . ground floor - residential block</strong>: C l o a k
e d in shadow, Scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset. With a
tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad-</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: G i v e him some space. I have him.</p>
<p><strong>a n o t h e r angle</strong>: Starkweather hits the deck
running, sprinting up the avenue. In BG, Scheer steps forth, stopgun l e
v e l l e d , aiming–</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: A l l clear. Flood the area.</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: H o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed.
Then let’s get him up to Level Three.</p>
<p><strong>a n o t h e r angle</strong>: looking down from high above as
the Censors move in on Starkweather. Scheer now walking away, tapping
his headset-</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: E t h e r c o n ? Send word to
dispatch. Starkweather Two-Delta is secured.</p>
<p><strong>r e v e r s e angle</strong>: Lincoln in CU, looking down. He
has seen and heard all that has just passed. In his eyes, we see his
daze clearing, consciousness coalescing, deepening. His pupils dilating
into a deep and uncanny stare. What can only be described as a
dawning.</p>
<p><strong>community announcer</strong>: Good morning - this is a
community bulletin… Following an incident in Sector Four earlier this
morning, The Department of Sanitation is issuing an all-sector
contamination warning…</p>
<p><strong>community announcer</strong>: The incident involved a
resident found to be infected with a pathogen. While the risk is
assessed, residents are advised to be aware of the symptoms. Should you
experience aberrant levels of anxiety or witness it in others,
immediately contact The Medical Center.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: You want to tell me what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: There’s nothing going on, Karl.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I’m jaded. Not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I checked up. In the past year, three
products have destabilized. All of them Deltas… and there’s nothing
going on?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You’re jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Once I can overlook. Twice I can call
coincidence. Three times I start giving a shit. Because if these
products are defective…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Q u a l i t y control is not your
concern.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: S o it is a quality control issue?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: That’s not what I said.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: He was in the subway tunnels for two days.
In the dark, no food, no water. His fingers were scraped to the bone. He
was trying to dig his way out. Now you try to explain to me why that
is.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: It’s not an exact science - biogenesis.
There’s a degree of trial and error. If the agnate doesn’t come together
on the first pass, we have to abort and start over. It’s like breaking
inertia. The bioreactor, the growth medium - we just keep upping the
levels till we achieve integration. At which stage the agnate is deemed
physically stable. We rely on foundation to provide mental stability -
matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with
parameters. When signs of instability started to show up, it pointed to
foundation. A hole in the wall, an oversight. But it was only happening
in the later generat- ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: So there was a production defect.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Actually the opposite. We found out in the
later generations, the levels were so high that when we broke inertia,
the process kept going. Over-integrating. Specifically the neural
system. It produced a condition called synesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Synesthesia…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: A fusion of the senses, creating a
component awareness. Sixth sense, s e c o n d sight, whatever you want
to call it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary. But it gives them
experiences beyond their functional parameters. And ultimately… it
destabilizes them. However, if we catch it early enough we can control
it with re-conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You find this amusing?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Poetic.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Poetic?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: This “agnate” took off just before his
sponsor placed an order. Maybe he got the sense his days were
numbered…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: This stays between you and me, Karl. I
trust I can rely on your cooperation?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Don’t you mean my complicity?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Remind me, why is it you were discharged
from the military?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or you’ll
find yourself out of another job.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Nobody else would take it.</p>
<p><strong>t h e courier</strong>: Clearance code: NG-230-2DS.</p>
<p><strong>v o i c e on speaker</strong>: New Gaza Healthcare. Okay,
you’re clear. Go ahead and get undressed.</p>
<p><strong>t h e courier</strong>: I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n
. I always leave this place with sunburn.</p>
<p><strong>v o i c e on speaker</strong>: Try full-course
decontamination. It’s even more fun. Especially the colonics.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: C h e c k in at the nurse’s station. Up the
corridor, left, then first right.</p>
<p><strong>the agnate mother</strong>: May I hold her?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: We have to run a few tests on her first.
In the meantime, I’m going to give you something to help you relax,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I’m incubating the baby for 24 hours
prior to transport. But go ahead and contact the sponsor. Tell her she
has a beautiful baby girl.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Let the record show the sponsor has
signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor- s h i p Agreement. Initiate
compliance.</p>
<p><strong>desk nurse</strong>: Starkweather ? Like the football
player?</p>
<p><strong>the courier</strong>: That’s right. Starkweather.</p>
<p><strong>desk nurse</strong>: Still showing in surgery. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>the courier</strong>: Honey, I got a bird on the pad and a
storm moving in. How long’s it gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>desk nurse</strong>: The courier’s here for pickup.</p>
<p><strong>the surgeon</strong>: Well he’s going to have to wait a
while. It took forever to put this one under.</p>
<p><strong>surgical tech</strong>: Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>desk nurse</strong>: He’s asking for an ETA. Said something
about some kind of storm moving in.</p>
<p><strong>the surgeon</strong>: For Christ’s sake, is that my fault?
Just find a way to stall him, okay?</p>
<p><strong>s u r g i c a l tech</strong>: Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>surgical tech</strong>: Subject’s heart rate is spiking.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev…</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.</p>
<p><strong>closeup</strong>: Lincoln’s face in part shadow, looking
down. The gleam of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view.
Listening now, to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter
until they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that
remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Accept.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester . . . I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln ? Are you okay? I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: The contamination warning. Somebody said
you’d been exposed.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I want you to meet me as soon as you can.
But you can’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Is it true? Were you contaminated?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You know where to come.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Jonesy. . .</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, champ. Are you alright? I heard there
was a contamination scare.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I saw what happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Starkweather . . . What they did to
him.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: They cut him open, Jonesy. The y took him
upstairs and they cut him open.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,
didn’t you? You’re contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: J o n e s y , listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Please . . . don’t come any closer. I don’t
want to get contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester, I’m not contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: But they said…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’m not contaminated!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Contaminants, pathogens… it’s just what
they tell us to keep us inside.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I saw it. Why they keep us here. To use us.
To take things from us.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: You’re not making sense.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Your baby… they’re going to take your baby
away… you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: M y baby? Why would they do that?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know! But I saw it!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: You’re scaring me, Lincoln… I want to go back
now.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You can’t go back! Don’t you get it?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: N o b o d y move! Stay right where you
are!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Don’t hurt him!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Somebody get someone down here!</p>
<p><strong>the censors</strong>: flooding through into the maintenance
corridor, in their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of
antibodies–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln and ester</strong>: deeper in, at another pressure
door, fumbling the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock
hisses open–</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: pushes through the opening gap of another
pressure door, taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake –</p>
<p><strong>lincoln and ester</strong>: meeting an intersection, veering
at random, running blind, running deeper into the faceless
labyrinth–</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: catching up, hitting the intersection,
pausing to split his squad in each direction - white uniforms
dispersing–</p>
<p><strong>lincoln and ester</strong>: reaching another pressure door.
Footsteps audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits.
The seconds pass. But the door doesn’t open. Lincoln looks around for
another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then–</p>
<p><strong>the pressure door opens</strong>: not onto a corridor but an
elevator car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.
His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all of them,
stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far
end of the corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he
doesn’t break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel
to–</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Ethercon! The elevator - override it! Do you
read me? Bring it back down!</p>
<p><strong>ethercon</strong>: You’re off the grid, sir. Give me a
second. Can you tell me where you are?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock them
down. Access only on my command.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester ! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>another foundation chamber</strong>: Censors making their
sweep. Strobes of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of
tanks. It angles to project a grid across each nascent’s face, then
fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.</p>
<p><strong>another foundation chamber</strong>: another contingent moves
up another row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables
plugged into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a
posture of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data
impression.</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: Nothing , sir. No sign.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: They can’t have got past this level.</p>
<p><strong>c e n s o r</strong>: Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just
picked them up at the surface!</p>
<p><strong>82 ext . the gateway - night</strong>: THE GATEWAY LOOMING
ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their knees, clawing at the dust.
Like burrowing animals, trying to widen the gap between the foot of the
gate and the lodeway.</p>
<p><strong>83 ext . front of the institute - night</strong>: A LONE
WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping to scan the
spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face tightening with
urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking-</p>
<p><strong>s c h e e r</strong>: The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up!</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: G e t me a bird!</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: A bird?! In this storm?!</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: The y got out! They got past the gate!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester ! We have to keep going!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: W h e r e did all the green go?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The r e is no green. The windows in there…
they were just pictures.</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: Ground team checking in.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: The storm pretty much covered their tracks.
We’re scanning for thermals b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it is
to isolate a heat signature. I don’t know, sir, it’s a big desert out
there.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I think I’ve found a path.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>sanger</strong>: Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our legal
department. Ellen, this is Bernard Merrick, director of products.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Thank you for coming out here.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Well when Henry called me I got the sense it
wasn’t for a social visit.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I understand there was an incident?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: First, let me stress there’s no way we
could have anticipated what happened…</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: We’re on the same team, Mr. Merrick. Just
give me the facts down-and-dirty.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We’v e lost two of our products. They
escaped containment last night.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: How exactly did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We’r e still piecing it together.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Do we expect more products to escape?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Don’t be so alarmist, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I’m sorry, Henry, but you asked me here to
assess our liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: To answer your question, we condition our
products with a deterrent. A fear of contamination. And thereby of the
outer environment. So to escape, they first have to escape their
conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Containment is one of the terms of our state
health license. The fact it was compromised could put us in
violation.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Bureaucracy.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Henry , it was a bloody battle getting our
license through in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: They’re not going to pull our license,
Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the Commission. Not to mention the
goodwill we earned in DC when we took over the facility; a bunker
complex for a bio- chemical war that never happened… We relieved them of
a costly embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I’m not sure we can rely on that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Alright . What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: First, I need you to level with me. What are
our chances of finding them?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well, in our favor, they’ve never been
outside containment. They’d have no coordinates, no sense of
direction.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I don’t see how that’s in our favor.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: They’re in the middle of the desert. Food
and water become an issue.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: So they might return to the trough?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: And if not? How long could they last?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: A few days maybe. But there is another
variable. We maintain the products in a sterile environment. So
basically their immune systems are untested. Toxins, pathogens,
environmentals t h e rest of us overcome routinely, to them…</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: That’s a little drastic. Some immune
systems are more adaptive than others.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Let’s take the drastic case. What then?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast-
track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access. The
female comes under the maternity plan. She’s three months pregnant. Even
if we fast- tracked another generation, we couldn’t fast-track the
pregnancy. We’d miss the delivery date, the sponsor would wonder why and
there would be… difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Even so, the worst may not happen.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: We haven’t even touched on the worst. If
these products reach a populated area, there’s the problem of
scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Ellen , we operate under State license
on a lease from the Federal Government…</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: We slipped through a loophole in the clone
laws, Henry. And they only let u s through because they smelt money. And
they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not
ours. It’s at the core of our license - why we screen potential
sponsors, why we make them sign discretion agreements, why containment
is such a critical factor - to limit the extent of public scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: E i t h e r way, it’s unlikely they’d
get that far. It’s at least twenty miles to the next settlement. Right,
Bernard?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Something to add, Mr. Merrick?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I just don’t think we should under-
estimate them. Especially the male.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: And I don’t think we should panic.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Gentlemen, whatever happens we need t o keep
one thing clearly in mind. As far as the world at large goes, we are
just another medical services company. Anything that alters that
perception puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on the sanction of the
law to protect us. Whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we
recover these products, we have to stay beyond reproach. All it takes is
one nudge to put us in the spotlight. Then you’ll see how fast
politicians can run for cover.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I n other words we need to find them o r
else. That’s very astute, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: My friend… she needs water.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Got stuck in that supercell, didya?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Supercellstorm , that’s what they call it on
the news anyways. I n my day, we just called `em “big ol’ h o w l e r s”
.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Yep, I heard it shut down some of the
lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess. Where were you folks headed
anyways?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Away.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: A w a y ? You mean, like outta s t a t e
?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: ” O u t of state”…</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: N o w where’s my manners gone? I’m Ozzie.
Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of
it, my last name bein’ D e e r . . . “O. Deer”.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n
d ’ s made herself at home.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Yer girlfriend sure is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: So what’s with them tattoos, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right? Now
this place, this is beautiful to me. This is my place. I own it. `May
not look like much but you’d be surprised. C’mon, lemme show you…</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff’s industrial
scrap. Comes in from all over. Easy way round the recyclin’ l a w s .
Me, I sell it on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown. Other stuff, I
pick up at the scrap markets. Fix it up, `fetches a price.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Fossil fuel transport. This piece o’ junk’s a
collector’s item. All that Age of the Wheel nostalgia, “elegant era of
transport” bullshit. I find the parts, she’s as good as solid gold.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Now this here’s got a colorful history. Came
in from this ol’ g o v e r n m e n t bunker out in the valley.
<code>Got shut down way back. Then this new outfit took over, stripped the place out. I guess they're doin' s o m e more remodelling cause I just had</code>em
in again the other day… Hump`n dump crew. Nice fellas.</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: You okay there?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’m going to check on my friend.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Welcome to The Sanger Institute. If
you know your party’s extension, press…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: Nuthin . I wasn’t doin nuthin .</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: I knew it… them clothes… them weird tattoos…
I mean, I heard stories from those guys but I never…</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: N o t that I believe `em… buncha c r a z y
stories… nuthin t o do with you…</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it,
huh? How about I go getcha a beer?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: What e v e r you want… Just take it… Whaddya
w a n t . . . ? You want money…?</p>
<p><strong>ozzie</strong>: I t ’ s all I got… Take it… just please… just
don’t hurt me…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: ” O u t of state” - how do I get there?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Bad news.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Which one of you is Diggs?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: That’s me, slick. This here’s my partner
Burdon. Don’t mind him. He gets a little shy around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: What happened to his arm?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>:
<code>Pursuit last week. The guy took a swing at him with a fireaxe. Didn't stop Burdie though .</code>Took
down that fucker with one arm, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: You don’t look like bounty hunters.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Well we’re on the job, see? And it kind of
helps if you bleed in. You don’t look like a bondman either.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I’m just an intermediary.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Now that’s what people use when they don’t
want to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I was told you also handled civil bonds.
Debt runners, data-thieves…</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: What we hunt depends on the bounty.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: It’s worth ten platinum. Unmarked.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: What’s the bond?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: The parties I represent want to limit the
specific details. But let’s just say industrial secrets are
involved.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Ten platinum. Must be big secrets.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Any good at keeping them?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Oh, me and Burdie, we’re busy bees. We don’t
have time to file every report and we got real bad memories. But just so
we understand each other, slick, we’re talking about a bag job,
right?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: What’s up with these tattoos? They look like
fucking boondock types .</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: All I’m authorized to tell you is they have
no records in this state. Also that they’re not armed or dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: How about we start with their names?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: John and Jane Doe…</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: You’re kidding me, right? No names?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: The n - with all due respect - how the fuck d
o you expect us to find them?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Because you won’t have to look. They jumped
an overnight shuttle. They’ll be headed for the terminal, trying to get
out of state. It’s strictly a recovery job. For you, it should be
childsplay.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: The n why not do it yourself? Or is the dog
ring just to impress the ladies?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: The parties I represent want to stay at
arm’s length. And just so we understand each other that means no
connection, no papertrail, no police interest…</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Is that everything?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: . . . no mistakes. They want these two
brought in quickly and quietly and unharmed. Once you have them, you’ll
contact me for further instructions.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I don’t know. What do you say, Burdie?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: F r a n k Hofstetter! This is a bond
recovery! Step away from the bar!</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Don’t bother. He’ll drop by himself.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: N o w . . . where were we?</p>
<p><strong>105 int . passenger car - morning</strong>: The sun is a
muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out of the window at
the bleak new world blurring past. He’s wearing Ozzie’s ballcap o v e r
his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded for some of the old man’s
ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise or perhaps just to shed the
memory. He glances across at Ester, dressed likewise, her hair teased to
cover her crosshatch. She’s dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET
COLLECTOR comes up-</p>
<p><strong>ticket collector</strong>: Tickets…</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t collector</strong>: A d u l t fare is forty five
currency units. Do you have the money, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I t ’ s going to be okay, Ester.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We just need to get out of state.</p>
<p><strong>v o i c e</strong>: He y , man, spare a little green?</p>
<p><strong>t h e hobo</strong>: A i n ’ t eaten in two days, have we,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I told you to stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: O k a y . Okay…</p>
<p><strong>t h e service clerk</strong>: A r e you gonna tell me what
you want?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What are my options?</p>
<p><strong>t h e service clerk</strong>: K n o c k yourself out,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I asked the man how to get to the terminal.
He said it’s not far.</p>
<p><strong>113 int . ticket window - day</strong>: The sign on the
window reads “Tickets”. Lincoln assimilates. The word is familiar. He
steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET CLERK - female,
immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy smile. Lincoln offers
her the blue card. She seems not to notice.</p>
<p><strong>t h e ticket clerk</strong>: We l c o m e to Phoenix Union
Station. What is your date of travel, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>t h e ticket clerk</strong>: An d what is your
destination?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: O u t of state.</p>
<p><strong>t h e ticket clerk</strong>: I’m sorry. Could you repeat
that?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We want to go out of state.</p>
<p><strong>t h e ticket clerk</strong>: I’m sorry. Could you repeat
that?</p>
<p><strong>v o i c e</strong>: L i k e talking to a wall, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: H o l o s e r v e . C h e a p e r than flesh
and blood but nothing between the ears.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: F i r s t time I used one of these, I asked
her out on a date…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: J u s t wanted to help, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>d i g g s</strong>: B u r d i e , it’s them. East exit.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: You folks need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He y ! What the fuck are you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>t h e hobo</strong>: I told you! They went inside!</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>b u r d o n</strong>: N o r t h Corner! North Corner!</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Why the fuck d i d n ’ t you go after
them?!</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>115 ext . alley - day</strong>: The refuge of shadow. The
alley is divided by a lodeway and the walls on each side are jutted with
dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk,
forced into single file.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We have to keep going.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: P l e a s e . . . Please, I want to go
back…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: T h o s e men - that’s what they want
too.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We have to keep going, Ester.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: S u n n a v a b i t c h ! What the fuck d o
we do now, huh? They could be anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: We go back to the office and run `em.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: A s what? John and Jane Doe?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: We ask the guy.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Y e a h , let’s tell him we couldn’t hack it
in kindergarten. See how long him and his ten platinum stick around.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: I t was blue, right?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: The y were using a blue currency card.</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: H i there! I’m Tattletail! What e v e r
you want to know, wherever you want to go, I got the answers! Let’s look
at the menu!</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: N o w let’s make a selection!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Transport…</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: O k a y ! Let me open that directory for
you! I’ll be with you in two shakes!</p>
<p><strong>j a n e e n</strong>: D i g g s &amp; Burdon Bond Agency.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: J a n e e n , where the fuck have you
been?</p>
<p><strong>j a n e e n</strong>: B e a u t y therapy. I got a date
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: O h , Jesus… Listen, I want you to punch into
the currency stream for me. Sweep for blue card transactions.</p>
<p><strong>j a n e e n</strong>: You’re kidding me, right? You have any
idea how long that’s going to take?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I want serial numbers, batched a n d
cross-referenced. Start from Union Station and work your way out…</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus
Lines. What is your destination, please?</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: I t ’ s okay. Really. I get that
a lot. I’m sorry, now where were we again?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I want to get out of state. Now.</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: B e l i e v e me, I know how you
feel. So where did you want to go exactly?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: O u t of state…</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: J u s t wherever the wind takes
you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: We l l , if it was me, out to the
west coast. It’s perfect this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t clerk</strong>: T r a v e l l i n g alone, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: N o . With her.</p>
<p><strong>t i c k e t collector</strong>: T w o adults, let me see… I’m
afraid I can’t get you seats till the morning.</p>
<p><strong>j a n e e n</strong>: D i g g s &amp; Burdon Bond Agency.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: We got a positive on the serial number. Punch
in and pull up the transactions. Start with the last hour and work
back.</p>
<p><strong>janeen</strong>: G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in front
of a screen all night?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I t ’ s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get this,
I’ll buy you a new ass, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln , what is that? On your face?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: A r e you alright?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: M y throat… it feels dry…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: O k a y . . . I’ll get you some water.</p>
<p><strong>d i g g s</strong>: P i e c e of cake, Burdie. J a n e Doe’s
in the bag. Keep an eye out for John-Boy.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Bond recovery… state license.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Play nice, little girl. Now you want to tell
me where your boyfriend is?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Behind you.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>m e t r o pd officer</strong>: M e t r o PD! Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I’m a bond agent!</p>
<p><strong>m e t r o pd officer</strong>: I said drop the fucking w e a
p o n !</p>
<p><strong>d i g g s</strong>: N o r t h b o u n d on Third. Get `em,
Burdie - and take off the fucking g l o v e s . . .</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: G o ahead. I’ll look after her.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I can’t… I can’t breathe… my throat… it’s so…
dry…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I ’ l l find you some water.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I t ’ s going to be okay, Ester.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: N o . . . no, it isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I ’ l l find you some water, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: An d then what, Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I ’ l l find another way. Out of state.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: An d then what? What if they find us?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The n we’ll keep going.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I can’t… I can’t run anymore…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We ’ l l keep going till we get there.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: The Island… You mean, The Island?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: N o w I’m going to get some water. But I
want you to stay here. It’ll be safer.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Don’t go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln. Stay
with me for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>janeen</strong>: What the fuck do you want now?</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Punch into the currency stream, close the net
on downtown and keep the search active. The next time they use the card,
I want to be right on top of them…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The man, the man up there. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: What planet `you been living on? That’s
the Juggernaut, brother.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The juggernaut…</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: Jamil “The Juggernaut” Starkweather -
highest rushing total in the league. `Least till that injury blew out
his gut. Now the doctors are saying he’ll be back on his feet next
season. Those fuckers sure can work miracles, huh?</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: Hi there! I’m Tattletail! What e v e r
you want to know, wherever you want to go, I got the answers! Let’s look
at the menu!</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: N o w let’s make a selection!</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Residential…</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: Please give me the name.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Starkweather…</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: Okay! Let me find that listing for you!
I’ll be with you in two shakes!</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: Starkweather , Jamil… I’m sorry! This
listing is blocked from the directory!</p>
<p><strong>the snake</strong>: You want me to find another listing?</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: We ain’t open for another
hour.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Y e a h , well we ain’t in the market.</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: E v e r y o n e ’ s in the
market, pal. One end of the barrel or the other…</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: We ’ r e chasing up a currency record from
last night. These two ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: What are you? Cops?
Lawyers?</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: H i m , I remember… Came in
just before closing… wanted a shooter but didn’t have no ID… settled for
one of these.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Did he give you a name?</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Did he say where he was going?</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>g u n s h o p owner</strong>: The r e was one thing. Kinda w
e i r d . He wanted to know how to use it…</p>
<p><strong>d o o r m a n</strong>: Fancy dress, was it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t know. Something. Just wait there
and make sure nobody’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: L o o k at this…</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The y said… I’d never have to see you.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The people…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What people?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look, if you don’t get out of here right now,
I’m calling security…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why are you here? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I want to know…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: One of the partners at my firm… he told me
about it. Gave me a referral. I thought he was joking at first. I went
out there, took the sales tour. Even before that I knew it wasn’t a
joke. There was this discretion agree- ment. I never saw anything like
it and I’ve seen a lot. Ironclad… breathe a word and they’ve got you by
the balls. I don’t know… There’s cancer in my family. Maybe it was just
to keep up. All the partners were on the policy.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The policy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Christ, you have no idea, do you?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t fucking do this…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Insurance. You’re an insurance policy.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Health insurance… medical…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If I get sick… if part of me gets sick… I take
a healthy part from you.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How do you expect me to answer that? It’s just
how it works, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What do you want? A fucking apology?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Why do I look like you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Because you are me . . .</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Because they made you from my cells…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Made me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s right. You were made. Cooked up in a
centrifuge like a fucking boiled egg. Every thought running through your
head, every word coming out of your mouth, all of it, manufactured,
made…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You . . . you’re the one who made me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Who made me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I signed a contract. I can show you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s all right there. Who, why…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look you’ve got what you wanted. Now why don’t
you just get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: There are men out there, looking for us. I
want you to make them stop.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t. Look, I’m a lawyer, I know how it
works. The contract, everything, it’s all laced with confidentiality
clauses. It means they don’t want this to get out. It means whatever I
do, they’re not going to stop. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Do you have transport?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Transport , yes… yes, parked downstairs… Bay
53… Take it…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: And then you’ll call security?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m not going to call security. I’m not going
to call anybody, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look, maybe there’s something… maybe there’s a
way to cancel the contract…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: For Christ’s sake! It’s not my fault!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Lincoln ! No!</p>
<p><strong>“piloting</strong>: MANUAL/AUTO?“. He assimilates. Then
ventures-</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Auto…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: O u t of state… West…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: The man back there… who looked like you… does
it mean I have someone too?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I just thought I should warn you. I have
a sponsor holding. His name’s Thomas Lincoln. He sounded… angry.</p>
<p><strong>152 ext . motel - downtown phoenix - late afternoon</strong>:
D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We
push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.</p>
<p><strong>the indian hologram</strong>: Welcome to Salt River Heritage
Park, home to the Hohokam Nation for over two thousand years. The park
is now closed. Please come back during opening hours, 9am t o 5pm,
Monday through Saturday…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: He has marks on his face like us.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Is this… is this place The Island?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I’m tired. Let me rest for a while.</p>
<p><strong>160 ext . the platform mound - night</strong>: A blazing
fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You look a little lost, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I was looking for water.</p>
<p><strong>grey dove</strong>: Not the best place to look.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: My transport… it stopped working.</p>
<p><strong>grey dove</strong>: I see. And where were you going?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Out of state…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>grey dove</strong>: It is a sacred place. My people come here
to commune with their spirits.</p>
<p><strong>grey dove</strong>: Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,
the spirit is like the shadow on the rock. Sometimes close, sometimes
far away, sometimes the sky clouds and the shadow fades. We come here to
ask our spirits to return to us. The man… He speaks to The Grandfather
from whom all spirits are born. The Great Spirit who binds every living
thing. He has no name. But he is everywhere. In the sun and the moon,
the wind and the rain…</p>
<p><strong>grey dove</strong>: Now he asks for the gift of vision that
he may see through to the spirit shape of things. To find the spirits of
the lost. To bring them into the light…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: A r e you alright?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I feel better after I sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The man out there… he said everything has a
spirit… every living thing… but not…</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I got thermals.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: I’m looking for two bond runners. They
ditched near here last night.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Somebody start talking.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I can make it.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Don’t worry. The one we want goes the other
way. He said it goes slower.</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Up there in the rocks. Three o’clock. I’m not
sure… it could be ambient.</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Diggs! Get me outta here!</p>
<p><strong>burdon</strong>: Help me! HELP MEEEEE!</p>
<p><strong>diggs</strong>: Burdie…?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester! Stop! It’s no use!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: We have to… get to… The Island…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: It’s going too fast!</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: We have to… get to…</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: O h , God… Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I take it you’ve heard the news.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: The bond agents. Yes. Unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Unfortunate? We’re way past unfortunate,
Henry.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I thought we’d covered ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: The police won’t connect the bond agents to
us. But that’s not the problem. It’s the sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: The male agnate tracked him down.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: His name’s Thomas Lincoln. It seems they had
a genetic reunion. Not a h a p p y one. It was all I could do to stop
him going to the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I still don’t see the problem.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: He may not want a police involvement but
he’s already threatened to file suit. And he’s one of the biggest
litigation attorneys in the city.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: That’s why we have you, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: That’s why I asked Bernard to come out here.
To find out how it happened.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I told her, Henry. About synesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I t was a marginal problem. And it was
under control - according to Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: That’s not the point. Whether or not it’s a
factor in this instance, it puts us in breach of the clone laws.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I t doesn’t even touch their
genetics.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: I’m talking about self-awareness. The
virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the
l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level.
Federal legislature, state licensing, sponsorship contract… But even if
we did manage to weather the legal storm, we’d never survive the public
scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I’ve spent my entire career facing down
naysayers, Ellen. Don’t think for a second I’m afraid of facing them
now.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: You remember cryogenics? At the outset,
people dismissed it as a rich man’s folly. Eccentric millionaires
freezing their brains, hoping to wake up in a new body.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: A l r i g h t . What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: O u r security chief - I’ve been looking at
his file. Ex-marine, served in South China - do we think he still has it
in him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: A r e you insane?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: ` You ever wondered why Henry takes those
pills, Bernard? Why he doesn’t avail himself of his own technology?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: An agnate could give me a new heart but
to get it to function mentally…</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don’t
want to deal with reality. Only with concept. I may not have been there
at the start but I heard the stories. You wanted in on every aspect of
construction, from environmental design right down to the classical
playlists. I t wasn’t enough just to make it work, was it? No, you
wanted your own little utopia.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: A r e you quite finished?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: E v e n God has blood on his hands, Henry.
Are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal
with it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: You see that street down there…? Running
east from the stadium. My father used to take me to church on that
street. An old Spanish church.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I didn’t know they’d torn it down.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What did you give her?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: J u s t something to help her sleep. I
think she has a bronchial infection. But I’m not sure I should give her
an antibiotic in case it effects the baby.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: S o you know about the baby…</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Is n ’ t that why you came here?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I found your name in the listings. I wasn’t
sure. You don’t look like her.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: The y have a plan… For women like me.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: S o you’re the one who takes her baby.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: You know when you’re young? How you run
around thinking you’re immortal?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: The r e was a lodeway accident. I was…
damaged. After that, I thought no man would ever want me. I was wrong.
His name was John. He said he married me for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he
called them. He always loved the ocean. Up there on the wall, that’s
John’s boat.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: But I think there was always an unspoken
regret between us. When we heard about the technology, it was like…
forgive- n e s s , like a second chance. A child of our own, part of
both of us. Sailing trips, fishing trips, so many plans… J o h n got
cancer a year ago. He died.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I r o n i c . That the same technology
could have saved his life. And now the baby is the only part of him I
have left. And the boat. I still have the boat.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I told you we shouldn’t have gone to outside
personnel. They were cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep this
away from The Institute.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: An d now?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Your resignation papers. Maybe `early
retirement’ would be more accurate…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the
papers, their loss becomes your gain.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: A parachute… So there’s a jump?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You understand that whatever happens, The
Institute must be able to deny it.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We use a chemical to dispose of waste
product. It’s called di-halcyonate. I t reacts on a molecular level to
start a process of internal combustion. The subject is incinerated from
the inside out. In post-mortem application it’s done its job before
rigor mortis. In a live subject, well… you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: You want to dispose of your products.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I t ’ s a little more complicated than
that. We have to be very… thorough. If you still have it in you, that
is.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Why do you think I still wear this?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I was discharged from the marines for
insubordination. If you asked anyone i n my unit, they’d call it
heroism. I disobeyed an order to fall back. I took out a bunker complex
single-handed.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: S o you wear it is a badge of honor?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: N o . It wasn’t bravery. I wasn’t afraid of
dying. I just didn’t care. You see, I suddenly realized I was just a
sack of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death, I just couldn’t see the
point anymore.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: You’ll find a vehicle parked outside. It’s
unregistered, difficult to trace. I take it we have an agreement…?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: What do I call you?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Lincoln . My name’s Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Lincoln , I think she needs professional
help. I think she needs to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: N o . They’ll find her. They’ll take
her.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: N o t if I don’t want them to.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You don’t understand. They don’t want
people to know about her. Either of us.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: The doctor I’m thinking of, he’s an old
friend. He look after John in t h e final stages. I trust him.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Why ? So you can take her baby?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: N o . No, that’s not what I want.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: M a y b e I didn’t realize she’d be so… M
a y b e I just didn’t want to. Either way, I was wrong. I want you to
know that. I was wrong… And I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: The y make you believe there’s a place
called The Island. Then they take you upstairs and put you to sleep.
They cut you open. They take pieces of you.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear
to you, I’d never have… They give you a choice, you see, to extend the
sponsorship after… after d e l i v e r y .</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island.
But I never saw anyone come back.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: You mean… Even if I had extended the
sponsorship, they’d have… and kept taking the money? But that’s
inhuman.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Is it? I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I’m from the Sanger Institute.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ve given you people enough of my time
already.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I t ’ s just a formality. I need to see your
sponsorship contract.</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: Is this the only copy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why would I make copies? Do you think I want
anyone else to know about this?</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: Katherine . . . It’s good to see you.
I haven’t seen you since John’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: We l l I’ve been keeping busy. Trying to.
Thanks for coming down to meet me.</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: Your call was a little cryptic. What
is it exactly that’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I t ’ s not me… Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>r e c e p t i o n i s t</strong>: N e w Gaza Hospital, how
may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: Your friend… she has pneumonia. At a
very advanced stage. Its progress has been unchecked by her immune
system.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: C a n you help her?</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: We have two options… One is a super- b
i o t i c . But there’s the risk her immune system might bow out of the
fight. The other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine has agreed to be the
donor. But the new antibodies may not conform fully. They m a y decide
to attack the baby…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t understand any of this.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: He means that by trying to help her, we
could lose her. Or lose the baby.</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: Or , if we do nothing, both. Her
immune system is… remarkably unstable. If we don’t act, the infection
will take over.</p>
<p><strong>189 int . hospital room - night</strong>: Ester lies in bed,
dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask makes breathing easier.
Lincoln enters and sits beside her. She stirs, meeting his eye with a
faint smile. Lincoln returns it-</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: He l l o , stranger.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: You look tired, Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Ester…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I t ’ s okay. I know. Katherine told me.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: She told me a lot of things. About how they
used a tiny part of her to make me. She said it wasn’t so very
different.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: F r o m this… From having a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: She told me how they use us… And I keep
thinking… about the others… the ones we left behind, about how they’ll
never know… how they’ll…</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I’m going to be okay, Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We have to go. We have to get her out.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: He’s come for her. For us.</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: What e v e r this is about, we can’t
move her. She’s already under sedation.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: How long before she wakes up?</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: The procedure takes three hours
but…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You’ll take care of it, won’t you? Take her
somewhere they can’t find her…</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: Katherine , what the hell’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>h u r l i n g him across the nurse station - instant
confusion -</strong>: NURSES RUNNING - PEOPLE SHOUTING - Lincoln takes
off at a run–</p>
<p><strong>c r a s h i n g - squealing onwards - scudding across vehicle
roofs,</strong>: finally nose-diving into an empty bay with a DEAFENING
CRUNCH-</p>
<p><strong>p a r k i n g attendant</strong>: We l c o m e to Holspar S t
a d i u m , home of the Phoenix Admirals, parking is fifteen currency
units…</p>
<p><strong>s e c u r i t y guard</strong>: You , what are you doing down
here?</p>
<p><strong>s e c u r i t y guard</strong>: O h , Jesus… Are you okay,
son?</p>
<p><strong>scheer</strong>: I’m jealous of you. You have a reason to
live. I can’t say I’ve ever had that…</p>
<p><strong>t h e fireman</strong>: N o t h i n g . . . If there was
anyone down there, they’re a pile of ashes now.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: M r s . Ester? My name is Ellen Crowne.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: M y name is Henry Sanger. I’d like to
offer my deepest condolences.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: This is Bernard Merrick our facility
director. He knew Ester personally.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: An d it’s a terrible loss.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this
time. But the sponsorship agreement has certain conditions relating to
confident- i a l i t y . D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of events,
those conditions remain binding. We want to be sure you understand
that.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: T h a t said, The Institute is likewise
bound by the terms of sponsorship and while we reserve every right…</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: You can stop there. I know why I’m here.
You wanted to know if I’m going to sue you for breach of contract.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: N o t h i n g so devious, Mrs. Ester. We
simply wanted to find some way to heal the wounds from this
incident.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I don’t want restitution, Dr. Sanger. The
reason I agreed to this meeting was to have the chance to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: O f course. Please…</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I never got to meet you when I visited
The Institute. It was one of your sales- m e n who led the tour. I
remember how h e described the agnates a s if they were some kind of
mindless organisms. More like livestock than humanity…</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: L e g a l l y , human rights don’t
apply.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Don’t interrupt, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I remember how eager I was to believe
him. But when I saw w h a t I’d created, in flesh and blood, when I
touched h e r , it was I who felt less than human.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Ester ’ s life was my responsibility and
her death is my cross to bear alone. So I’m not going to sue you,
Dr. Sanger… But I am going to blame y o u . Until the day I die, I will
silently curse your name. That’s w h a t I wanted you to know.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: An d now I’d like to leave, please.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: We do have other issues to discuss…</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: N o , Ellen, that’s enough. I think
Mrs. Ester has said all there is to say.</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I don’t think they suspected
anything.</p>
<p><strong>d r . abrams</strong>: J u s t understand that I’ve put a lot
on the line for you, Katherine.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I know… But it felt good. It felt like
something John would have done.</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: We l l , I don’t know about the two of you
but I’d say we got off lightly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: Did we?</p>
<p><strong>crowne</strong>: Don’t start getting maudlin, Henry. It’s a
little too late in the game.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
and on behalf of our staff, I’d like t o welcome you to The Sanger
Institute. Before we start the tour, we’ll be serv- i n g r e f r e s h
m e n t s in the visitor center and circulating our standard discretion
agreements. I should add that today you are all very lucky because our
CEO and founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us and will be leading the
tour personally.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I can’t find my sunglasses. I think I left
them on the shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: We l l we’re about to start the tour. But I
can have someone check for you.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: S i r , this is a restricted area…</p>
<p><strong>dr. sanger</strong>: C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
beginning, the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic
landmark- to break the curse of heredity, to correct congenital defect…
genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science. A
bright future that led to a dark age and much of… . . . l e g i s l a t
i o n we know today. But while the clone laws may have narrowed the
field, science marches on. Only to… I’m sorry, I’m f…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: He’s having a heart attack! A doctor!
Somebody get a doctor in here!</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: S i r , I’ve been trying to contact you.
It’s the ether… Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: E t h e r c o n ! Ether control, come
in!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: An y o n e ! Somebody pick up!</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: That’s what I mean. We can’t get through.
The circuits are locked.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: How wide is this going?</p>
<p><strong>censor</strong>: C o m m u n i t y - w i d e , sir.
Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>i n t e r c u t t i n g</strong>: Agnates a t workstations
watching on visors. In the subway watching on platform banner. In the
plaza watching on the glass wall. An agnate in an apartment, watching on
a wall panel.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I t ’ s been a year since the breakout. A
year in hiding, waiting for things to quiet down. I don’t know how many
made i t out or how many who did, survived. I know there are people
called politicians trying to say it never happened. That’s why I’ve kept
this journal. To keep the truth alive. Alive… I’ve learned what that
means but it still confuses me. In functional terms, I’ve been alive for
ten years. In human terms, more than thirty. Human… I’m not sure about
that one either. They say I’m not human because I have no mother or
father. I guess I have more to learn. But one word I do understand is
hope. So maybe this j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like me, who
may be out there. To know t h e y ’ r e not alone. My name is Lincoln S
i x - E c h o and this is my testament…</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Is he hungry again? I just fed
him.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn’t sound
right. That name.</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I t ’ s the name of his father.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: We should finish packing.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: You’ll make sure this gets out?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Yes . There are people sympathetic to the
cause. I’m going to get it to them.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: Thank you, Katherine. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Don’t forget that. It has the operating
manuals for the boat.</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I’ve been looking at them for months.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: But the maps, the charts…</p>
<p><strong>lincoln</strong>: I don’t need them either.</p>
