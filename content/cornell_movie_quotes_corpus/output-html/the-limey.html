<h1 id="the-limey">the-limey</h1>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Edward Rama?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Eduardo. Rama.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You’re home, then.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: My name’s Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You wrote to me about my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I didn’t expect anyone.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No reason.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I mean, what has it been – six months?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Round about, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I didn’t even know who I was writing to – just
someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It was better than a telegram.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Who done it, then?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Snuffed her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Now, wait up a second, man.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I never said nothin’ about nothin’ like that.
No, no, no. That’s not what I wrote to you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious
circumstances, and that.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping, all
right? I told you what I know. It was an accident. I didn’t say anything
about anybody being “snuffed.”</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: This bloke she was bunked up with. This
Terry what’sit.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Terry Valentine.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Valentine. What’s he got to say for
himself?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I dunno. What’s he gonna say? They had a fight
that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don’t even know the guy.
Don’t get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn’t travel in
the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Valentine came into the restaurant where I work
with Jenny a couple times. He’s a money guy. Jenny would say, hey,
here’s my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he
wouldn’t even see me, you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How long had she been in the States? Near on
ten years, wasn’t it? Long enough to know her way about, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: There was an investigation, okay? The car was
totalled. Jennifer was … Her neck was broken. On impact, they said. So
she wouldn’t have … felt the effects of the fire. It happens up there.
Happens a lot. What more can I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What more is there.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m just sayin’ – it was a steep hillside. There
was no moon that night …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her
to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or
something, have a few drinks. But that’s it, nothing more than that.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No, not my girl. Self-control, she had.
Point of pride. And people don’t change, do they.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I dunno … Maybe they do.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Going straight, are ya.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Boomerang.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Y’what?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I knew when I was droppin’ that letter into the
mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my
time, okay? My sister, her ol’ man’s up in Chino right now doin’ eight
years.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: This ain’t your lot?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You kiddin’, man? I don’t need a wife and
screamin’ kids. I still got my youth.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I go to work, try to keep my life together, put
all that shit behind me, man. What d’you want from me.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I only asked.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me
to drive her downtown. Said she was meeting – her boyfriend – Valentine.
But I think she was looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What, tryin’ to catch him with another
bird?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s what I thought, man. But it was not a
hotel or nothin’ that we went to. It was someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Where abouts?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading
some trucks. Some kinda deal goin’ down. I don’t know and I don’t care.
Maybe they’re shipping fava beans to Eskimos.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Did Jenny know?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Valentine wasn’t even there. If he was into
something, if she was involved – who can say. But I’ll tell you
something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing them.
Checking them out. I felt like she was covering my ass that day.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I drove her back to Valentine’s house.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He was standing outside waiting for her. That’s
the only other time I ever saw him. Last time I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the
cops?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nah, coppers don’t do nothing, do they.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be
real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o’clock in the morning,
it’s dark, your mind is all agitated, you’re drivin’ a little too fast …
Those curves don’t kid around.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You should talk to Elaine. That was her best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She didn’t write to me, did she.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: She didn’t know what to say. I thought someone
should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don’t know – Jenny
liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Who’d Jenny get it off of – this grass or
whatever?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not me, man. I’m no drug dealer, what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I think you didn’t get that lot in the Navy,
doing your National Service.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what
that is? State prison.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nick’s a nick, n’ it? No matter what state
you’re in. State of remorse, most likely – for gettin’ caught.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But that’s not me anymore. That’s when I was
into the gang lifestyle. That’s not who I am now. Five years in the
joint – that’s it for me, man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Just got out meself, didn’t I.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Go home, man. Get on a plane.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ll be needing a shooter.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re kiddin’ me, right?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What do I do, then, look in the bleedin’
Yellow Pages?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: These are not guys you can just go run a number
on, man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Thought perhaps there’d be dispensing
machines, you know. Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum,
fully-loaded.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill
out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting
period?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation
officer wonders where I’ve skived off to.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn’t’ve let
you outta your country, much less prison.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Travelling on a dodgy passport, n’ all.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Which is why I thought, save some time, get
what I need under the table, like.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Under the table?</p>
<p><strong>pa system</strong>: Attention: the long-range vermin-
shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the
rear of the Convention Center.</p>
<p><strong>beam salesman</strong>: BeamSight II is easily mountable on
any shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will project a small, bright red dot
directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed …</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Man knows what he likes.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Lookin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: That’s a high-end item. Total
reliability.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’d you call that – the Protector?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Yes, sir. Won’t find a better CQC on the
market.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: CQ what?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own
home.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Trouble is, I’m not at home, see. Fancied a
bit of target shooting, y’know, while I’m here – with me mate.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Oh really? Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: England. Only, we saw there was a show on,
thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You came to the right place, sir. My wife’s
second cousin is English. Well, Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a
holster?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Just luck, this, really. Never been to one
of these before.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You’re in gun country now, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Been to the Boat Show.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Packs a punch, but it’s compact, has
accessible features – makes a nice concealed-carry piece.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He don’t have a concealed weapons permit.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Don’t have time for a lot of paperwork,
y’know. Just popped over on a quick visit.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: I can take care of the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: No problem. If you don’t have a problem with
me reporting this gun stolen.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No. Not at all. Do we?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not me, man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I mean, it’s already a steal, n’it – what
you said – four hundred for this one?</p>
<p><strong>dealers</strong>: Well, I’ll have to add another two hundred
on top of that.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, aye?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: … for the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Violation of my parole, this. – Goin’
abroad.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend.
Wouldn’t’ve even been a gun show … for another month.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn’t be
allowed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go
visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It’s only insurance. Can’t be too careful.
This Terry Valentine, he’s probably a wonderful fella. They were
together how long?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Five years, I think. Long time.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, there you are. Jen must’ve liked
him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got
blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled
at me. Buried her at a “private” service. Private for who. Him?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Hang about. I thought you said he come into
the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I
work. That’s not where they met.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: And that’s where you met Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, no – Jenny used to work as a waitress.
Before she met him. But that’s not where she met me. Not in my
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How’d the two of you hook up, then?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: How’d you get in here.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Walked.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: You walked. What the hell are you doing
here.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know
him?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: He’s expecting you?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: So why would he want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I have a message for him. About Jennifer
Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Jennifer Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Yeah. I know her, all right. She came
down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day’s work, took
me weeks to get back on schedule. If she hadn’t a’ been Terry’s woman I
would’ve broke her jaw. ’Course, she’s nobody’s problem now.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Is Valentine here?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Where is he, then?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Listen, get the fuck out of here before
you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here,
asking questions?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Do you hear me, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Go on, get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Fuckin’ nut. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You tell him. You tell him I’m coming!!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Not before. Not before. Think about it.
What does it mean? What – no, I’m not. Think. Yes. See? You figured it
out all by yourself. I know. Are we done? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Adhara. I told your father, if you’re
looking for a name, you can’t go wrong with a constellation.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: I used to hate it. Now I like it.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Could be worse, he could’ve named you
Reticulum.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Is there anything in the world that you
want or need?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: I want to know why you need that scary guy
in your house.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Gordon? He’s been with me for years. He’s
not as tough as he looks.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Then what good is he?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Is it possible that you’re too young to
be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Is that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Not for you, clearly.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: I’m loyal to things that make me happy.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Am I a thing?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Well, you’re certainly not a person.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: No. You’re not specific enough to be a
person. You’re more like a vibe.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’m so glad we’re having this chat.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: It’s not a knock.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: It’s not a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: It’s an observation. Like: I’m hungry. When
are we eating?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: As soon as you get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: What kind of food?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Anything but Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’m not into finger foods. Too fussy.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I don’t like do-it-yourself cuisine.
Buffets. Salad bars.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: You demand to be served. A fork
fetishist.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: It’s just fuel to me. I’m not there for
distractions.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: For some, eating is a sensual experience.
The sensual experience.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: That’s what Gordon’s always saying.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Oh, god.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’ll be there as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: There’s been some trouble downtown.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: What the papers used to call a “gangland
slaying.”</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Our black friends?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: No, Terry. They don’t work like that. Jenny
Wilson’s father paid a little visit, left a message.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I thought he was in prison, in
England.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Well, either they have a very liberal
work-release program, or he’s out, because he’s here in L.A., looking
for you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: We wait, and we watch.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Italian?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Italian.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Not who, food. Should we get Italian.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: As long as I don’t have to pass Gordon
again. I’m never ready for that.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No. I know another way out.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re Jenny’s father.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Had a feeling it was you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You look alike.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Perhaps it was the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not her brand.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She used to pinch ’em off me. Funny that.
One thing she never tried to get me to stop.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Wanted to talk to you, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Sort a few things out.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Been busy, have you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I was skint – didn’t have no money to get
here.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s not what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What was that, then?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I heard you were – what’s that adorable
phrase? – “at Her Majesty’s pleasure.”</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It was the bars, then.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: In any case, I don’t suppose the salary you
make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline
travel.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest
day’s work in my life, dear. Wasn’t about to start when I was in stir –
not with all that leisure time on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: And not with all that buried loot you had
waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn’t
it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would’ve been … fourteen at the
time?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Hardly buried. Earning interest, love.
Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum,
that.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, that kind of security can’t be bought.
Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Here, aren’t you gonna let me in.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Try calling me again.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I was just going to toss some vegetable
rolls in the microwave, open a can of diet soda. Want to take me
out?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: … No, I went in for more improving pastimes.
Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark.
Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more
rats in people’s houses than there were people in people’s houses.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Sounds like Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Here, are you always this sarky?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I’ll mellow when my
ship comes in. It’s expected any day now. I’m all packed and ready to
go.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Weren’t you on a television series?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: If it played in England somebody owes me
money. Who told you that – Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Said it went on for donkey’s years.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Three seasons. They found that’s the limit
of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family
of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three – the
ingenue.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, it just ended, then.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Now who’s being sarcastic?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: When you’ve lost as many years as I have,
love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry. I guess the rest of us have no
excuse for wondering where the time went. It must’ve been the bars.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s a kind of prison, doing a series. Early
to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the
boodle for as long as it lasts. Only difference is you can’t get
arrested afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I can’t believe Jenny told you all that.
About me. She was always so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She never told Eddie, though.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She never told anyone else. About the
convict strain – or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who
helped Jenny efface her past.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How’d you manage that, then.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: When I’m not honing my craft in episodic
television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would
have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah, well, she started all that in
London.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Modelling.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Learnin’ ‘ow to speak proper. Central School
of Speech and Drama. It’s no doddle gettin’ in there, y’know. At
seventeen. They offered her a place at RADA n’ all, only she’d’ve had to
wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was
Jenny. She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high
to a grasshopper. Show up the old man, you know.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You weren’t disappointed in her, then.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: In Jenny? ’Course not. How could I be.
’Course I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She was twenty-one when she came to me. …
Straight from leaving you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Footloose and fancy free.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She was happy here. However the two of you
might have parted. Don’t think she wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: That’s the trouble, n’ it. She enjoyed
life.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: When did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yesterday. Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You haven’t been lurking outside my building
all day.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No, I had – some other matters to attend to,
you know. Getting a car sorted …</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I might’ve been away for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you
were goin’ out, you’d probably have to come home first.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: And you’ve seen Eddie Rama.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are
muckers.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I should really give him a call. He’s a
character, isn’t he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the
outside world.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: He give me your address.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to
write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to
Jenny. Who told me she didn’t have a father – before proceeding of
course to tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, don’t suppose she did, really, most of
her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time –
and then the bright lights beckoned.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Were you still married at the time – to
Jenny’s mother, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her
second husband done a runner after she got sick. They give me
compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. We were
always mates, me and Jenny’s mum. I like to think they’re together again
now. Y’know. Heavenly choir.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The address Jenny gave me, that wasn’t a
prison, was it?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nah, accommodation address.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What’s that, like a P.O. box.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Something like that, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Where you get your bank statements.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, you gotta have something permanent,
don’tcha. Even if it’s a hole in the wall. No matter which jug I might
be transferred to, I always got someone on the out checks up on it for
me, see. Anything I need to know, comes round on visitor’s day – word in
my ear.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Some word.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I already knew. Knew beforehand. When was it
supposed to have happened? – two o’clock in the morning, Eddie said.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s what was estimated.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Eight hours difference between here and
London. Would’ve been, what, ten in the morning, my time. I was just
coming out on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper
till then. Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs – well, stretch the day
out, really, that’s what you wanna do. And I’ll tell ya: I couldn’t open
the paper. Could not pry the pages apart – it was like they was glued
together. That’s how weak my hands went. Thought I was having heart
attack, only I knew I wasn’t. Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he
says, you’ve gone all white. I said, fuck me, I’ve been in prison half
my life, what d’ya expect. But he was dead on, ’cause I could feel the
blood drain right out of me head. And I knew … Something had happened to
Jen.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Make yourself at home. Steal something.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: There’s nothing I can’t afford to lose.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, I gathered something from the article
what Eddie sent me. Some sort of pop music producer, wasn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Rock n’ roll, is what we called it. He’s
sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the
grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings
happened. More of a kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that means. Just
took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it.
Packaged and sold it. Made out like a bandit.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What’s he done lately.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Lives high off the hog and waits for the
next big thing. Like me – but on a grander scale of failure.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Now, you shouldn’t run yourself down. My
employer, Mr. Lindgren –</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – Your employer?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: – Mr. Lindgren.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Who’s Mr. Lindgren?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: My employer.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What line is he in.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Proprietor of a London firm. Of
longstanding.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Based in London, but with international
concerns.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I bet.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Various enterprises, style of thing.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I thought you said you never did an honest
day’s work in your life.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest,
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Anyhow, he’s always saying to me, Dave,
never run yourself down, son – ’cause there’ll always be plenty of
people willing to do it for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: In what capacity are you employed by this
Mr. Lindgren?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: This and that. Y’know. Ways and means.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – When he wants someone run down, you’re
willing to do it for him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: So what’s the deal. You and Terry Valentine
at twenty paces. Is that what this is about.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Why not.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you serious.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Have you ever known me not to be.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You fuckin’ guys and your dicks.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What’d you want me to do. Stay at home,
twiddlin’ me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. .</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You don’t believe it was a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What do you think.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Terry’s never going to give you
satisfaction. Not the type.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Depends, don’ it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: On what. What makes you so certain.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ll bloody well ask him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: There’s the phone. You want his number.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I got his number.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m not going to help you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Told you you wouldn’t be able to see through
that gate.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Gate’s open. I had a butcher’s at the
house.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’d you butcher at the house?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Butcher’s hook. Look. I don’t much reckon
those minders of his.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: He’s brought in the heavy mob.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Extra muscle. Bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Has he?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: They look a right load of wallies.
Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the
fuckin’ Household Cavalry. Watch it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That was one of them?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: See what I mean? Wearing bloomin’ uniforms
n’ all.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What’s so fucking funny?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Those aren’t guards. They’re valets.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Valets. What d’ya mean valets. What is he,
then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Valets. They park cars. He’s having a party.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Keep it handy, mate, all right? We’re not
stopping long.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Valets, eh? Aren’t we all la-de-da.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I thought you just wanted to check out the
house, man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, that’s what we’re doin’, n’ it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No one else is even here yet.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: First in, first out, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Gentlemen. What can I get you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Dubonnet with a twist? Baby sham? Tomato
juice and Tabasco sauce?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Got a Coke?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: You have the same posters.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: That you have down at your office.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Different ones.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: I like the colors.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: We all did.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: It must’ve been a time. A golden moment.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Have you ever dreamed of a place … you
don’t really recall ever having been to … a place that probably doesn’t
even exist except in your imagination … somewhere far away,
half-remembered when you wake up … but when you were there you spoke the
language, you knew your way around … That was the 60’s.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No, it wasn’t. Wasn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: It was ’66 … early ’67. That was all.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Hello? Hey! Great. You got my message? Yeah.
No, Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place. Yeah, there’s like three
different ways up the hill; the quick way is to bear to the right. Sure.
Okay. Okay. ’Bye!</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Hey, I thought you weren’t a buffet
person.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I’m a gracious host.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t you work with Ian?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Ian?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI
offices in London.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Sorry. Wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Unless I’m not who I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s too bad. Ian’s got a good thing going
over there.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Turned that place completely around. 180
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain
of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I’m
saying?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Right. Chain of respect. That’s good,
that.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah. Cheers, mate.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: If you could afford a house like this you would
buy a house like this.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What are we standing on?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Faith.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Could you?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Why don’t you go nick one of those little
cooker what’s its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the
garage. Look about for a toolbox while you’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Hi. Terry Valentine.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Have we met? There’s something I can’t
quite –</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: EMI in London. I work with Ian.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You must know Ian.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Great bloke. Really turned things around
there. 180 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I suppose that’s good, unless things were
fine the way they were.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.
Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don’t they? Forgetful. Start
thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake ’em up now and
again, make ’em pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>excited guy</strong>: Terry, Terry …</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Glad I got to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>excited guy</strong>: Ter … Ter … you gotta …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Thanks. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Be seein’ you.</p>
<p><strong>excited guy</strong>: Charles Grodin is here.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Toolbox?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Put the Sterno on the ground, near the
center of the garage.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Bring the motor around. Bang out in front,
right?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You goin’ back inside?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: One thing I need.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Steady on.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You steady on, man. What the fuck else did you
do back there.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Bloody hell.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why didn’t you just kill him, you had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: That would be too easy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Too easy?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: He’s gotta know why.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You think a fuckin’ guy like that ever will?
What more do you want, man?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: C’mon, man! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: You should have let me do the talking.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Why, because you’re my security
consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: What did you tell them.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I told them a long-time employee flipped
out. Had a drug problem, refused counselling. Set the garage on fire,
then committed suicide. One of my “guests” tried to stop him – but how
do you stop Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four
hundred pounds.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Heavier than that now. But are there any
drugs in that stomach to back up your story.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: As it happens. I didn’t make that part
up.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: And where is this guest? Don’t they want to
interview him.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I don’t know everyone here. He was so
traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon’s pusher.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Where do you think he is, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: We’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No. I mean. Not even your people should
be involved. Right? It’s too close now.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: You could use a few of my prime shitkickers
up here.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You think I’m staying?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: There’s already gonna be talk about how
people close to you keep falling into canyons.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere
the fuck near me.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: I have other resources.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Come over here.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: How they goin’, kid?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: How’d you like to kill someone for me?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Same as last time – the rest after.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Where do we go?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: When you find the guy, you’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What shit is this. I just do it. I don’t
prepare it.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: I’ll point you in the right direction, but
you’ll have to take it to the end- zone. He’s a hit-and-run gunman – I
figure he’s not cruising the Polo Lounge.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is un-fucking professional.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: See, a successful man like me has limitations
– I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy
like you who’s closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is
a lifestyle I embrace.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: That’s why I’m letting you take care of this.
I’m the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about
you? Not even God.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I was in the neighborhood. I come down here
quite a bit. Watch the planes taking off. Study the architecture of
early David Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Jenny was supposed to come to my place that
night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had
been – having some trouble. Lately. I don’t know about what. On this
occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She told you all about my details but not
about his. Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She’d never called me like that before. She
sounded more … pissed off – angry – than upset or afraid. But she never
turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they
found her … she’d been going the wrong way. Not the direction she’d have
gone if she’d been coming to see me. Or coming straight to see me. Who
knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How did you come to have my address? Found
it, did you. Among her things.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You think Terry gave me access to her
things? Probably sold her clothes.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: And how did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She gave me your address.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: How much.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I got half.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Makin’ trouble for someone?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Which kind?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: The forever kind.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How long’ve you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: This town’s been chewing my flesh since …
what we now refer to as “the early 70’s.” Christ, my past became
nostalgia and no one even asked me.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Early 70’s. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly
Brixton.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: These more highlights from the Zagat prison
guide?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You don’t seem bothered.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You don’t know how I’ve compromised my
standards.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Tell us about it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s too involved; a lifetime of non-
involvement. Anywhere else I’d be an interesting little number, here I’m
just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor’s
Guild.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, I was gonna say …</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Still, there have been rewards. It’s sunny.
And some of the producers who call even have credits.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I can see the attraction.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What did you do? To make them take the early
70’s away from you.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: A jeweller’s up the West End. We tunnelled
our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road.
Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed – after we’d made
the grab, ‘n all. Would you Adam n’ Eve it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You mean if they’d nabbed you before you
actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making
a mess.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: We were lucky to be nicked. Me and the lads
went down there Sunday evening, we weren’t discovered till the Monday.
Good job we were still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It didn’t discourage you, though.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: From pursuing your chosen profession.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ll tell ya something: it made me a model
prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom
after that experience? Not bloody likely.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I was inside once. I punched a cop at a
demo.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Did you. What was that in aid of?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Who remembers.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Get seven years, did you?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Overnight. What about just now?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Just now? Overnight?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You have been away. Or is all this just new
to you?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It’s true. Has to be said. I got off to a
slow start.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Honest. Didn’t know where to look till I was
21.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Pushing the legal limit even then.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
street. Funnily enough, she was married to a milkman. Straight up. I
said, “Good is she? Been around?” He said, “Good? Listen, mush, it’s not
that she’s been around, it’s that she’s been around hell of a long
time.”</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Your most recent incarceration. What was
that for?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It was for nine years. The last nine
years.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: I’ve lived in L.A. all my life, I’ve never
done this drive.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: All your life. That happened while I swam
the length of my pool.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Nothing. I guess it’s hard to pass on this
road.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: The freeway’s faster, but lacks a certain
majesty.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Just feels like the car behind has been
following us the longest time.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I sure hope so.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: All I’m sayin’ is travel time shouldn’t be the
same rate. Travel time is down time, right? I mean, we’re not even in
the same car as the client. You told me the job was at the house. When
we get to it. Well, are we shadowing the client right now or are we just
going the same way? The company I was with in Seattle, these
distinctions were made. Now, I don’t dispute him getting the full whack.
Seniority and all that. But if I’m getting paid the same hourly rate
when we’re at the house as I am in this car, that doesn’t sit well with
me and I feel obliged to say so. ’Cause in Seattle what you’re paying
now for so-called travel time was half what we got for actual clock-time
with the client. So I just feel we should get more when the job actually
commences.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: … I’d really like to eat your pussy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I believe in mocking the afflicted. Good for
’em. Makes ’em stronger.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Ever take a look at the women who work in pet
stores? Wow.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Jesus, are you gay enough or what.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: black woman with dyed blonde</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: … you can always tell the ones who’ll do
anal.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Kinda makes you wonder why more people don’t
put a bullet through their fuckin’ skulls, doesn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out
of his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Why don’t they have TV shows about people
whose daily lives you’d be interested in watching. Y’know. Like SKINNY
LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.
Wouldn’t that be good?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who’s
driving?</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: The L.A.P.D.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh yeah, keep doing that. That’s really
healthy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Can’t you do something about your ass?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Other people’s lives scare the shit out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: “Homeless” people. Fuck them. Remember when
they were just bums? Everyone with an axe to grind. Like to grind in
their face. Pretty soon there’ll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups.
Stupidity activists.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Wonder what it’s like being a dumb guy in a
dumb suit trying to cross the street.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Life sure is a minefield.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Look at that one. She’s really been used.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’d love to be famous so I could snub
ordinary people. Imagine, you’re famous, you’re sitting in a restaurant,
some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin,
his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish
the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends. Bam! You
tell ’em to FUCK OFF! God, I’d love that.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Is that her? I bet that’s her.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Maybe she doesn’t even know the English
guy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Avery said she was tight with his
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: That don’t mean nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: She’s nice lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So what.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: I dunno. I just said she’s nice
lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: And I said so what. You think she’s any
happier?</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: What d’you mean, any happier?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Any happier than any other asshole in
life.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: I dunno. I never met her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – they want Southern, I do Southern, they
want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I’m
shit out of luck. One thing I can’t do is English. Americans can’t.
Shouldn’t even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn’t do us.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You ever been to London?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Only in the movies.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ve ’ardly ever left it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yeah, well, you’re here now – – where
hurricanes hardly ever happen.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ve got the hang of the driving. Found this
place all right.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you get
here but you can cover it in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Not that I recall.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What about your grandmother?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nah – she was married to me grandad – he was
as bent as a boomerang – used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop.
Crafty old sod.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He alive to see this?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon,
Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What’d your father do?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Black market during the war.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I guess you’re just habitual.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You sound like my fucking probation
officer.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Won’t he be looking for you about now?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Good luck to him. He couldn’t find his prick
if he didn’t wear Y-fronts.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Minor officials bother you, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Do us a favor. Can’t even go have a slash
without ’em saying, what’re you going in there for?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi, kids.</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Tell me you wouldn’t prefer a steady
income.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I got a steady income – I’m on the dole.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: A leech on the welfare state in addition.
You don’t miss a trick.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I fiddle it. They got me down as an
immigrant with five kids.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yeah … Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary
siblings.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Last time might as well’ve been the first. I
remember all the times, don’t I. Watching her grow up – in
increments.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She told me you were a ghost in her life.
Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, she twigged by the time she was eight
or nine that daddy wasn’t in the Royal Marines or doing scientific
research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour
of</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Still, you could never … do what she
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: She used to tell me she’d turn me in. Little
kid. Ten year old. “If you’re naughty, Dad, I’ll tell on ya.” She didn’t
want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job. “I’ll tell
’em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look, I’m calling the Old Bill right
now” – picking up the telephone. I can see her, the phone in her hand.
Became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn’t a joke.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She never would have turned you in, not in a
million years.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I know that. But as time went on … well, it
wasn’t a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it – about the last job –
how long I’d get the hook for. Said she wouldn’t be there this time when
I got out.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: This is where I come in.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: There’s one thing I don’t understand. The
thing I don’t understand … is every motherfucking thing you’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Look, mush, you’re the guv’nor here, I can
see that, I’m on your manor now, right. So there’s no need to get out of
your pram. I’m Johnny-come-lately to all this. Whatever the bollocks
between you and this slag Valentine, it’s got nothing to do with me. I
don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. I believe this
Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I can well believe it. I’m sure he has done,
son. He’s about as straight as a dog’s hind leg.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: But I can’t be sure. I don’t even know who
he is. He’s too insulated. Too many layers around him.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I’m
here on another matter entirely.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: Yeah, I guess you are.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Good job your lot showed up when they did or
it would’ve been me for the high jump.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: That dude who works for Valentine. He’s the
one sent those guys after you. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah. Shouldn’t wonder. Must’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: So what’s your beef, pal?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can
see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion
where I’m concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: It was you. Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: Because that wasn’t anything to do with me.
And suspicion has been cast in my direction. Didn’t make any sense.
Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then
screwing them over too.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No, I can reassure you on that point.
Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: He’d already grabbed more than his allotted
cut. Didn’t think he’d be so bold as to take all of it.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: All of what?</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: Of the deal, man.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Oh, yeah, right. The deal.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: But if you’re mad at him too and he’s mad
at you … that must make us pals.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: In which case I’ll just do what I usually
do.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p><strong>feather</strong>: What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Looking the other way. Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I mean, how much are you getting? Just as a
point of interest. See, I didn’t realize there was a sliding scale.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Straight rotation, no shit, call your
shot.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Lemme break.</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: You broke last time.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Let him break - he likes to break.</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I wouldn’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I saw your mother on the Strip last night.
She went up to three guys, said she’d like ’em to stick one in each,
know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gramms</strong>: Valentine had himself a party, I hear.</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: My client has already given a statement
regarding yesterday’s events.</p>
<p><strong>gramms</strong>: A statement? I wouldn’t mind getting a
statement. You see, my client – the United States Government – would
love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your
client.</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: Deals? My client is involved in any number
of deals at any given moment. You’d have to be more specific.</p>
<p><strong>gramms</strong>: Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How
about downtown? There’s some folks there – oh, wait, they’re all dead.
Any of this ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: My client is an entrepreneur. I am his
lawyer, not his business manager.</p>
<p><strong>gramms</strong>: So you wouldn’t have any idea how your
client continues to make so much fucking money.</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: He’s always been very forward-thinking. He
invested wisely.</p>
<p><strong>gramms</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>fielding</strong>: He had urgent business in the north.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Where’s Big Sur?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Up the coast.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know – few hours, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Fancy it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep
forgetting, for you this is a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Never thought of that. Busman’s holiday.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What’s in Big Sur?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: That’s where Valentine’s scarpered.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Bloke told me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I hear it’s a nice drive.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What d’you say, Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not much – you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Same.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Last time I saw you, weren’t you up for some
equity-waiver thing?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you
know – with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Didn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, those are the breaks.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Not no more, they ain’t. I quit that acting
shit, man.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You just cooking then?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hell, no. I started writing.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: We coulda used the other two-and-a-half
grand.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: There’s more than a measly few grand in
this.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: There is?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Something’s on.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-
his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Like what.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Like he’d never hire me for real. Not
week-to-week. I don’t have the credentials. He thinks I’m just a
sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs “plausible denial.”</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Well, we blew it, didn’t we? He ain’t
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: “He ain’t wrong.” Listen, I know this asshole
who did just go to work for him. Full-time. And this dickhead’s parents
just told me he took a road trip up the coast. That’s the type of
individual gets hired, someone who’ll shoot his mouth off to his family
while on the job.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know who that English guy is. Some
kind of – – courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But
Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him – and I betcha there’s a
briefcase somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Drugs? Cash? Both if we’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: How we gonna get that lucky?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: While they’re all fucking each other over …
couple of parties like us could move right in.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’ve been wondering something.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Do you have any friends, man?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah, I suppose. Call ’em that, yeah. Down
the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Friends and colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You can’t count on very many people, that’s
the trouble. Number of times a decent job’s been cocked up …</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Poor baby.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office
once.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What post office?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: The lot. The whole British bloody Post
Office. I had a brilliant plan – all worked out – work of genius, it
was. Could I get anybody interested? No – they’re too busy pinching
orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford,
they’ll be up at the crack of dawn.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re just on a higher plane, Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Too bleeding true, ‘n’ it.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Exercising my visitation rights.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I miss my kids.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: They’re at college. Or doesn’t your
accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’ve made it … brighter.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t want you here, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What kind of trouble are you in?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No trouble.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Surely you can think of somewhere else to
take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: We weren’t followed. Susan.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Where’s … what’s-his-name – Fred –</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: – You know his name is Frank.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know I don’t live with him.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers
workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp –</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: In a couple of days this whole thing
–</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Who’s looking for you?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Go now.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s been five minutes and I’m packing to
leave again. I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: That’s right, your life is Shit, and I’m
to blame. It’s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It is that simple. I blame you for
everything. Losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didn’t have to
lead to hardcore porno in every American household: that was you. The
first on your block to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to
your friends. A little recreational pot didn’t inevitably have to lead
to the eventual devastation of the inner cities: you made that happen,
the first time you bought a bigger stash than you yourself meant to
smoke. It happened when you made your first buck hyping some so-called
“event” that was over before it began or marketed some “product” whose
only value was its instant disposability. You were the first person to
see there was a lot of money to be made selling Navajo rugs – you’ve
even stolen from the fucking Indians! You looked at Charlie Manson when
all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw
another merry prankster, the freedom of the frontier. Your pal here – –
He saw gated communities. Rich people coming to him with their money,
terrified of what people like you had left of this society. Why invest
in a marriage and children when you had him? He’s your oracle. But you
couldn’t even trust in friendship, could you? Still he’s the dog you
call for its dinner. Because everything that might once have been fun or
nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour. That was your
“genius,” Terry. Haven’t you read your own press?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What is it, you just like the reassuring
smell of disinfectant?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, Elaine. You even know what he’s saying half
the time?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, but I know what he means.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Do any of these guys cook?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: … Reminds me of Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hard to miss.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I thought maybe you just came for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’d rather be with him than without him. I
don’t want to be found dead in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Check the news.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Where’s the remote?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Where’s Larry?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Turn all the lights out. I’ll get Adhara.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Stay away from the windows.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Uh, you’ve heard of knocking?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: I need you to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Why, what –</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: I thought I said stay away from the
window.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Everybody in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Behind the counter.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: We think someone is here.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: We think?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: We can’t find … … two of our guys.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Larry and Rick.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Did somebody call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Because –</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Because I’m taking care of it.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: You guys are fucking nuts, I’m calling –</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Mr. Avery.</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: Watch my back.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Avery’s down.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fuck this.</p>
<p><strong>uncle john</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>adhara</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>avery</strong>: … that way …</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Tell you …</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: About Jenny. Tell me about Jenny. About the
deal. Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she
found out about it, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Tell me. Tell me about it, you fucking
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: She could’ve had the deal! I would’ve
handed it to her if she wanted. I would have given her everything.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Why then. Why did you do it!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: She didn’t want to share it, she wanted
to stop it. To stop me. She said she’d turn me in.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: She said, “You go ahead with this, I’ll
turn you in, Terry.”</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: She was serious. She would have done it.
She had the phone in her hand. She was going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Ta.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: You’re English.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: I can never decide what I like better. Leaving
home, or coming back.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I would have preferred staying home, me.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: You’re a reluctant traveller, then.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Got called out to L.A., unexpected like, to
do a job of work.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: You’ll be looking forward to getting back,
then.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah. Another little matter needs attending
to soon as I return.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: No rest for the wicked.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Been away a lot.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Where else?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine
years.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Nine years? Is that legal?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Well, time off for good behavior, you know.
I shouldn’t have even been there – it was these other blokes who shoulda
gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.
I don’t mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else’s, know what I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: But you stuck it out, anyway, all that
time.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I had to, didn’t I. Nothing else for it.
Then just when I’d finished my nine years – my contract – wallop, I had
to bugger off to the States.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Sounds like you need a rest.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Could do, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: But first I gotta give these lads a talking
to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: The ones whose burden you took upon your own
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Them next.</p>
