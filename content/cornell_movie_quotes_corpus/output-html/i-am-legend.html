I understand that… my wife, Virginia Neville is… yes… … I’ll be there in

<p><strong>local washington reporter</strong>: The First Lady was buried
in a brief ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery and then the

<p><strong>old man</strong>: Need some gas?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Only got one kind.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Hell of a night.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: So, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I’m am architect. I’m working on a site
back in –</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You built things.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I guess you could say that.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Round back.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Hello – are you there?! Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Hello…?!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Virginia Neville.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Neville… Neville… … oh – um – she’s…
she’s up on six –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: But you can’t – you can’t –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I’m here to see Virginia Neville.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You’re not supposed to be here.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I need to see Dr. Madden.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry, you’ll have to wait downstairs
–</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I’m not going to wait downstairs. I want to
see my wife.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dr. Madden, this man –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Dr. Madden, I’m Robert Neville, we talked
yesterday, my wife –</p>
<p><strong>national guardsman</strong>: Is there a problem here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. madden</strong>: No, no problem.</p>

<p><strong>neville</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. madden</strong>: Please go downstairs to the lobby and
I’ll call in about four hours.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: We’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>dr. madden</strong>: Hold on, please. Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I’m taking her home.</p>
<p><strong>dr. madden</strong>: That might be best.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: … tallest building downtown. You can’t miss
it.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: This is Robert Neville. I am living in Los
Angeles. Rendezvous at the plaza in front of the Branson Building. I’ll
check every three days at noon. If you can’t wait leave a sign. It’s the
tallest building downtown. You can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: This is Robert Neville. I am –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Robert, what were you thinking…?</p>
<p><strong>french voice</strong>: Good evening. Did you have a pleasant
day today?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new
vehicle. A big vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>french voice</strong>: That sounds charming. Did you meet any
interesting people today?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yesterday. They’re back. Haven’t seen them
for a few months. I have to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>french voice</strong>: Tell me about the interesting people
you met, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: They are… sinister. They want to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>french voice</strong>: That sounds charming. What are you
planning to do tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: – suppose that’s only natural. But I spend
a lot of time looking back now. Probably way too sentimental, all this
looking back – – but given the option…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I remember the first time we met. Do you
remember that?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: It was at Diane’s party in Malibu and I
had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had
the nerve to come at me – watch out. So you come sauntering in – you
know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth
thing.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: And you’re like this mountain cutting
through the party and all the girls are whispering, “Ooo, who is that
hunk o’ man?” So finally you work your way to me and I’m all ice. So you
turn on the smooth thing and I finally say “Look, Bob or Buck or
whatever the hell your name is, you’re too goddamn big and you scare me
so take that filthy cigar and go play Bruce Willis somewhere else.”</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: And the look on your face! It was like I
kicked your puppy or something! This wounded little boy face on top of
this glacier body…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I fell in love with you right then, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: The funny thing is that I’m really going
to miss those damn cigars. Sometimes when you’re at work and I – now
that I can’t go out – I light one. One of your cigars. I bet you don’t
know that…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: And…I just let it burn down. Because it
makes me think of you. And all I want to do is think of you.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: All I want to do is think of you.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No one really knows. That’s why we’re all
so scared. We’re lost, you see? This thing is killing everyone and we
have no idea where to go or what to do. We’ve just been… abandoned…
haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: But at least I’m going as I am, or as I
was. Those others, the mutations, the suffering they must be going
through, God, that must be awful. Like their blood is betraying
them.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I wonder if we should leave town. Seems
like everyone else is going. We could stay with my sister in the
mountains, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: But what good would that do? Nowhere’s
safe anymore. We can’t… escape.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Let’s just… stay here.
It’s our home. And I want to die in my own home.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: – living in Los Angeles. Rendezvous at the
plaza in front of the Branson Building. I’ll check every three days at
noon…</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Can you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Mine… Mine.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hemocyte woman</strong>: My – name –</p>
<p><strong>hemocyte woman</strong>: Is – Emma.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: My name – is – Emma.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: My name is Robert.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Robert.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You – think I am – I’m – – an animal.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You lie – like a human.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I can’t live like you do – all your machines
and – cold metal and sharp corners –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: You lived like this once.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That is not now, human!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: My name is Robert.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Great, I finally find someone to talk to
and all you want to do it argue.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It is not arguing to speak the truth.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Listen to me, my blood somehow… helped you.
It could help all of you. We could find some way to –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: To become human? Is that what you think we
want?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Look how you live. You – fight – for warmth
and meat and light. You fight through every day in this place that has
moved past you. It is a place for us now.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Would you like to see the sunlight?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Do you want to go on?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s so… warm. I forgot that.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: How much do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It comes back. Flashes. My name.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Do you remember where you lived?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It was warm. I was outside. The ocean?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What about… now?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: With them?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We move. Place to place.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: When you’re here, in the city, where do you
live?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Dark and large. With vines – no, not vines.
Not alive.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: My wife.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Was this – “beautiful?” Before?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Do you remember where it is?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Where you lived with them.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You want to find them.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You want to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why don’t you start with me?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: You’re not them.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Open a vein and let me feed – then tell me
what I am.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What choice did I have – ?!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You hunt us like animals – do you know how
many you have slaughtered?!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I only protect myself – !</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You are The Human. The Hunter. The thing that
comes in the day and kills –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: If I’m a hunter it’s because you taught me
to be!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Are you going to keep me caged up forever?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Will you keep feeding me? How long can you
live like that? Until it kills you? Until I kill you? Without your blood
I’ll go back.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: We don’t know that –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I know it. What do you want, Robert?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I wanted to hear someone say my name.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then know I am what I am. I could be across
this room and on your throat before you had time to scream.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Do you recognize this?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Have you always had it?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Have you looked inside?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: What’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Humans.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Look inside now.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: That’s who you are too, Emma.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Before… when I was one of them. I would look
at this and it was just strangers. Now I… remember.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I don’t want to remember.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m not an animal.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I have to go into the city.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I won’t lock you in. You can go if you want
to. Or wait until tonight. I won’t keep you prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Do you still want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I want to remember my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I remember laughing at all those cranks
talking about the millennium and the end of the world, telling us how
nature was going to strike back in revenge for the rain forests and the
ozone and pollution…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Or even the fire-and-brimstone crowd
talking about God’s vengeance and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I
don’t remember who the Horsemen were. War was one, I think.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: And Pestilence. I’m sure Pestilence was
one. I guess he won the race. But just by a nose.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: If I believed in God this would be easier
maybe. Some Supreme Wisdom making this all happen. Some purpose. But I
don’t believe in God. Do you believe in God? I can’t… remember. There’s
so much I can’t remember now. I have to ask you when I see you.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: … the tallest building downtown. You can’t
miss it… This is Robert Neville –</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: There’s one thing we never talk about… you
know we don’t. Why aren’t you sick? Everyone else… is dying. Or dead.
Are you the only one who’s going to survive? How can you live like that?
So alone. God, I hope there are others.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Now, at the end, because it’s really the
end now, I think about you all the time. My biggest fear since I’m
forgetting everything now – is that I’ll forget you.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Maybe it’s all evolution. Maybe nature or
God or both decided this page had to turn. So our time is now over.
Leave the planet to the insects. Had to happen sooner or later.
Nothing’s immortal.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Except you. Maybe you’re immortal. Or
maybe it’s something in your blood, something scientific, something
complicated and medical. But I don’t believe that. Not anymore. I think
it’s more simple than all of that I think you were chosen.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: EMMA!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: EMMA!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Emma…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: He wanted me to see – he thinks I was –
infected by you.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Shhh… don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I want to talk. I just learned again.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You have to go. He’ll never stop. Leave this
place. Find another.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I’ll go. We’ll both go. Far away.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You lie like a human.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you for letting me remember. It was…
warm.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I think you were chosen. I think you were
chosen to survive. To bear witness to the eclipse of this life. Of our
species. So I don’t want you to mourn for me. I don’t want you to mourn
for us.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: You have a purpose, Robert. We are all
myth now. And you are legend.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: You and that damned garden.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yeah, but when your mother came what’s the
first thing you showed her?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: I surrender –</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Besides, if we get a lot of work done this
summer it’ll be done.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: It’s never gonna be done. You love
puttering out there too much.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Well, it’s not supposed to be done
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: That’s the whole point – it keeps on going
– it’s a process. We keep on planting and it keeps on growing.
Forever.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: The more we plant, the more that’ll grow,
and the happier –</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Virginia…?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: VIRGINIA!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: WHERE ARE YOU?!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: LET’S FINISH IT! NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: Where do I go now?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>neville</strong>: My name is Robert Neville.</p>
