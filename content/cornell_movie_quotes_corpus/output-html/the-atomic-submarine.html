<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It cost Commander Robert Peary twenty
years or unremitting hard- ship and misery to reach the North Pole,
finally, in 1909.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It would have astounded Peary to learn
that, by the late 1950’s and early 60’s, the vast, frozen
top-of-the-world he pioneered had become a vital highway for world
travel and commerce. Not just in the skies…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …but also deep under the ice, in the
frigid, five-million-square- mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Here great passenger and cargo- carrying
atomic submarines glided by the dozens, back and forth across the Pole,
until a series of mysterious undersea disasters threatened to close the
Arctic route forever.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The decisive moment came May 3, at 1315
hours, when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all,
reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude - only a few miles from
the North Pole it- self!</p>
<p><strong>close arctic sea lane</strong>: AFTER EPIC DISASTER!! - - -
Mysterious Loss of Sturgeon, Latest in Series of Polar Tragedies,
Prompts Drastic Action.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: According to the official reports, the
next phase of the life-and- death drama occurred May 10, in Washington
–</p>
<p><strong>bureau of arctic defense</strong>: WAR ROOM NO ADMITTANCE
WITHOUT SPECIAL SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: – at a hush-hush, super-secret meeting in
the Arctic theater war room.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Admiral Terhune, in charge of the Arctic
Theater for the Joint Chiefs, well knew the effect the ‘leak’ of any of
the explosive information would have on the world civilian population.
So the Admiral was determined: There would <u>be</u> no leaks!</p>
<p><strong>revised 5-26-59 “atomic submarine</strong>: 6.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Admiral Terhune!</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Gentlemen, this is the man we’ve been
waiting for - Skipper of the atom killer sub, <u>Tiger Shark</u> -
Commander Dan Wendover. This is Justin Murdock, Secretary of
Defense…</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Mr. Murdock…</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Commander.</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: And I know you’ve heard of Dr. Clifford
Kent, Dan –</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Commander.</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the
development and design of your boat.</p>
<p><strong>24</strong>: MURDOCK Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from
London.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Are you <u>the</u> Doctor Hunt - Nobel
prize winner for Oceanography?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Let’s say <u>I</u> took the bows for a team
of brrlliant associates.</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just
<u>one line</u> from a detailed staff study prepared for the Joint
Chiefs: “In our judgment, these Arctic disasters <u>may</u> prove the
gravest emergency in all history.”</p>
<p><strong>murdock o.s.</strong>: Any comments on that statement?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Bit on the fanciful side, isn’t it,
Sir?</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Possibly, possibly. Let me read you a
partial list of observed phenomena: 1. Complete disruption of communica-
tions with Dew line warning stations. 2. Destruction of four surface
vessels, largest, 10,000 tons. 3. Radioactivity in Arctic waters, floe
ice and bergs. 4. Peculiar television images preceding each distress
call. 5. Seven Polar atom subs, vanished without a trace! “Fanciful” did
you say, Sir Ian?</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Now we come to you, Dan. You skipper the
Tiger Shark, the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she’s undergoing emergency, around the clock modification in
the Bremerton navy yard.</p>
<p><strong>admiral o.s.</strong>: Removal of all but two atomic
torpedos. Special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic
missiles. A special escape hatch in the keel for the
<u>Lungfish</u>.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: ‘The Lungfish?’</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: A special deep-exploration device - sort of
an animated diving bell. Captain Siguard Nielsen developed it, after he
retired, if you remem- ber? He’ll be going with you - - along with
Dr. Kent, and Sir Ian.</p>
<p><strong>32 camera rolls in slowly for tight two of the
admiral</strong>: AND WENDOVER</p>
<p><strong>admiral</strong>: Special orders are being cut recalling your
entire crew from leave, effective at once. There’s a fast jet at
National Airport waiting to fly you, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian to
Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>revised 5-26-59 “atomic submarine”</strong>: 10. 33</p>
<p><strong>admiral o.s.</strong>: The Mission of the Tiger Shark is to
hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters. If humanly
possible, you will remove it:</p>

<p><strong>reef</strong>: Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you’re
exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats
a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing
Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of
the Tiger Shark and myself -</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: But Julie’s a nice girl, and I’ve seen you
work. She deserves a fighting chance!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Helen. I appeal to you -</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dave! Look at me! I am the mother of your
three children! Now <u>please</u> take me home to them. At once!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Dave <u>is</u> exaggerating. Just think, a
man spends three months in a deep freeze. It’d take his whole shore
leave just to thaw him out. By that time, he’s ready to report back!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: It won’t take <u>me</u> long to defrost - not
around <u>you!</u></p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What was I saying…about thawing out
icebergs?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: You never can tell about ice- bergs. Only
one-ninth above water.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: After that kiss - I’d say that’s about
right.</p>

about: ’Let’s not waste one precious golden moment - any second, there
could be a knock on the door, and -</p>

couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec,
Commander Richard Holloway.</p>

quarters.</p>

<p><strong>chester</strong>: What’s the scoop, Griff? Hauled out in the
middle of the night - all leaves cancelled. We goin’ to war, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>griff</strong>: Don’t you worry, Chester. When the Skipper
wants you to know what’s going on, he’ll tell you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: I don’t like it. This is all mighty funny

anyway, huh?</p>

Reef - You’ll have to share quarters, this trip.</p>

<p><strong>carl</strong>: It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack,
two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: How is he - ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It was moderate. He’ll be all right. But it
was out of the question, his coming along.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place
the Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There was no choice. Dad and I developed the
Lungfish together. Except for him, I’m the only one qualified to dive in
it.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: You could train someone else.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not in two days. Look: Do you think I

to stow our stuff.</p>
<p><strong>griff</strong>: An empty <u>locker</u> in a <u>sub</u>? Are
you kidding? This whole deal is making less and less sense to me.
What’re <u>frogmen</u> doing aboard the Tiger Shark?</p>

them over while I fill in the crew.</p>

This is the Captain speaking. I know you’re wondering about all the

<p><strong>wendover o.s.</strong>: Our mission is so dangerous it had to
be kept completely secret. It’s our job to find out what caused the
disasters under the Arctic ice. Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any
command you hear will be the real thing, remember that!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: That’s about it. Now you know as much as I

<p><strong>reef</strong>: I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you
enrolled at the Academy, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A
real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught
us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: So all of a sudden his only son drops out of
school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead,
do-gooder, and crackpot! ‘Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs!
Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!’</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: A lot of people think like that.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: But <u>they’re</u> not Skipper Neilsen’s son!
It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl ‘the honest,
sincere son of a war-mongering father’ - Captain Neilsen resigned from
the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects
like the ‘Lungfish’ - but it broke him, all the same.</p>

<p><strong>reef</strong>: Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.
We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a ‘copter’, and take
you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You ‘trade school boys’ are all alike, aren’t
you? Anybody who doesn’t happen to think like a little gold-braided
puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: <u>You</u> said it. But I won’t argue -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wearing a uniform doesn’t bestow an automatic
monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>! It just so happens I’m <u>not</u>
a coward - physical or mental - and before I’d risk my father’s
life…</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: We’re <u>all</u> risking our lives!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is,
and I’m staying here!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: You’re really a mixed-up oddball, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to
<u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should
have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I’m referring to War -
<u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being
spiritually yellow!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting
for?</p>

<p><strong>kent</strong>: Sir Ian has evolved a theory. At first, I
wasn’t about to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: It is rather fantastic -</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Here is a chart of the Arctic region. On it
I have plotted every instance of these strange phenomena - sinkings,
electrical storms, our own experiences…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian o.s.</strong>: Here was where we encountered the
electrical storm…The Sturgeon was lost just about this area.
Others…here, here, and here…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Do you see it?</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: The pattern. Each incident occurred almost
precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole. A line through the
points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian o.s.</strong>: …<u>about</u> the North Pole.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: I cannot accept the idea that these
phenomena were either random, <u>or</u> natural. I believe they are
motivated by… some sort of intelligence!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: You mean somebody has been -</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: I did not mean to imply, neces- sarily, a
‘human’ intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Then - what on earth kind of in- telligence
<u>is</u> it, Sir Ian?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Perhaps not ‘on earth’ at all. Perhaps it
comes from <u>beyond</u> the earth!</p>
<p><strong>113 reaction shots - members of the group - panning

<p><strong>reef</strong>: Can anything be done about it?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: I’ve been thinking about that. These
appearances of…whatever we’re dealing with…make almost a complete ring
around the Pole. But there is what <u>may</u> be a signifi- cant gap, or
break, in the ring…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian o.s.</strong>: …right here…the Queen Victoria Sea
area, near Franz Joseph Land…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: …above Murmansk, and Finland.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this
<u>could</u> be the next danger point!</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate
a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: We’ll chart a course straight across the
pole - to bring us <u>here</u> - - the Queen Victoria Sea!</p>

feet. No discernible ori- fices…</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: ‘The Eye of Cyclops..!’</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What did you say, Sir Ian?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Just musing about our ‘one-eyed adversary’
and the legend of Homer. ‘Cyclopes’ were the Sons of Heaven, who forged
the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Our ‘Cyclops’ throws quite a thunderbolt,
itself!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I knew there was something familiar -</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>kent o.s.</strong>: The picture was taken by an amateur
astronomer, over New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I’ve had it since I served on the Air Force
Evaluation Board, for UFO reports.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Unidentified Flying Objects.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Then…this is a ‘flying saucer?’</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: That was the popular designation.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But…weren’t all the sightings in the sky - not
under water?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: This would explain why there were never any
reports of land- ings. It’s possible that who- ever - or whatever -
inhabits the craft is not a land creature, but a form of marine
life.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: That would make our ‘little green men’
actually ‘little grean fish’???</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Undersea flying saucers!</p>
<p><strong>griff</strong>: Excuse me, Skipper—</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Yes, Griff?</p>
<p><strong>griff</strong>: All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen
report exterior damage minor.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Then we can get under way?</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then
that’s <u>our</u> course! Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go…..until
we get him!</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Or, perhaps, until he gets us?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So, the Tiger Shark began relentlessly
stalking her space-enemy. Up to the Pole, back to the Arctic Circle…
again, and again…a week… a fortnight, a month….</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there
were reports…new disasters, new ships and lives lost. Invariably, the
Tiger Shark made for the scene, only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperatian, the pursuit seemed fruitless.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Then, on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian held
an urgent discussion with Reef and the Skipper…</p>
<p><strong>161 int. ward room - night - close down shot - chart

<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: We’ve asked ourselves that - over and over
- a thousand times.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not
more questions!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: We think maybe, now, we <u>have</u> them!</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: We took for granted his source of energy was
nuclear. But suppose it isn’t at all - what if it’s <u>magnetic</u>?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: The North Pole is the positive end of the
biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: What you’re getting at: You think our
saucer-friend <u>has</u> to return to the Pole, regularly to….recharge
his batteries?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: That may be over-simplifying, but—</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Now: Our present tactics are hopeless. But
suppose we could place ourselves <u>between</u> Cyclops and the
Pole….</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: ….in such a way as to prevent his returning
to it and, as you put it…. …‘recharging his batteries’?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: If we were lucky enough to catch him with his
power depleted….</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: ….we could polish him off with an atomic
fish! That’s it, Reef! We’ll wait until the next report of trouble. Then
we’ll lay on the bottom, right in his path, and bushwack him!</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: ‘Bushwack?’</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: American tactical expression.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So - a chance of tactics. Now the Tiger
Shark cruised almost over the North Pole, waiting for the radio report
that would put the plan into effect… On July 13, at 1600 hours, it
came!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: We got it, Reef!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Cyclops?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small
freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday,
then…nothing.</p>

would one go about <u>get</u>- <u>ting</u> inside Cyclops?</p>

<p><strong>dave</strong>: Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp
it around the eye, and —</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, you can’t. But <u>I</u> can – I can
deliver you to the eye. Then you –</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Little out of your line, isn’t it? You better
stay aboard and make a speech – maybe get ’em to ban flying saucers!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s enough, Holloway. I’ve told you before,
wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine
doesn’t auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: - any more than being the son of Captain
Neilsen does!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: However our ideas disagree, as I’ve said
before, I’m <u>not</u> a coward! And it happens you’ve got no choice:
Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don’t get
there -</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: I’d sooner swim!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: That’s enough, Reef! Both of you! It so
happens Dr. Neilsen’s right. The odds are long enough, without making
them longer. Get the Explorer in the airlock, ready for launching.</p>

<p><strong>revised 5-26-59 “atomic submarine”</strong>: 101-A</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Where do you think the voice you heard was
coming from?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Somewhere down there?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Wonder where Powell and Carney are?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: We’ll have to look for them later.</p>
<p><strong>289 through iris down ramp to floor - black backing
-</strong>: DAY - PAN SHOT - DAVE AND REEF</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m with <u>you!</u></p>
<p><strong>291 est. shot on floor (platform) - cavernous interior
-</strong>: BACK AT TINY MEN ON PLATFORM - MATTE SHOT</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Remove your weapons, Commander. And
come here - alone!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Come where?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The voice again?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: To me - here!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Here - keep these. It wants me to come
alone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Oh it does???</p>

<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: So, Commander Holloway - as you Earth
inhabitants would express it - we meet ‘face to face.’</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: That’s a <u>face</u>???</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Point of view is everything. To us,
<u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Tell me something: Why can <u>I</u> hear you,
when the others couldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: You do not ‘hear’ me! Our in- dividual
brain frequencies are now attuned, and we exchange wave-thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>reef o.s.</strong>: You mean ‘Extra Sensory Per-
ception?’</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Whatever your ‘earth-term’ may be. The
principal is ancient, and very simple.</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your ‘thought-response’ will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>300c int. section of bridge - day - down shot - panning
with</strong>: DAVE</p>
<p><strong>300d int. sphere - day - matte shot - up past ‘eye’ -
at</strong>: REEF IN IRIS</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: My mission is to study various solar
systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: - for horrors like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>saucer</strong>: Of course. It may interest you to know I
have visited hundreds of other worlds, and of all of them, your Earth
seems most suit- able.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Swell!</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Your friend was to remain where he
was!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: He did!</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: I am afraid not. Therefore -</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Dave - !</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’s goin’ on in here, Lad? What - ?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Stand away from him, Commander!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So this is ‘headquarters,’ huh? Well, you’ve
sunk your last ship, you….</p>
<p><strong>revised 5-26-59 “atomic submarine”</strong>: 105-A</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Why not me? What am I - the closing act?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: On the contrary. I want you - unharmed
- perfect.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: I have selected you, to return with me
- along with several other specimens, for study. We will examine you and
the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our
‘earth-colonizers.’</p>
<p><strong>reef o.s.</strong>: Then you just…‘build them in?’</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Of course. Evolution is much too slow
a process.</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: On earth you build with inanimate
material. <u>We</u> employ living tissue. This space vehicle, for
example…</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: It is a living thing. When damaged -
you would say ‘wounded’ - it immediately ‘heals’ itself.</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: That’s why no water leaked inside when we
rammed you?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Of course. But it is time to be- gin
the return voyage –</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: To navigate, won’t you have to… see your
way?</p>
<p><strong>saucer voice</strong>: Obviously.</p>

<p><strong>312 int. depth-explorer - day - at hatch window -
over</strong>: CARL’S SHOULDER</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Back to the Shark - right now!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What about Dave - and the others?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: ‘Fortunes of War!’</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: This is Reef, Skipper – in the Depth-Explorer.
Don’t wait for us - start engines, and pull loose!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: All right, Reef.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Reactor Room! This is the Skipper! I want
all reverse full-emergency power!</p>
<p><strong>316 int. lower chamber of saucer - day - special effect
shot</strong>: - CLOSE ON ‘EYE’</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: What about — ?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: We didn’t kill it, Skipper. And if it ever
gets…back where it came from…the Earth is doomed, and everything and
everybody on it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ve pulled loose, Skipper! We’re free!</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty
knots!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Nothing we can do, now.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last,
desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot…</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Anything —</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: It’s possible I could adapt one of the torpedo
guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would ‘home’ on the saucer when he
rises from the Pole.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: What about time…?</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to
recharge his power banks.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: All right - go to it.</p>
<p><strong>324 int. forward torpedo room - day - cuts to cover -
work</strong>: ON MISSILE -</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Adapt a complicated guidance system to a
huge ballistic rocket - convert it to a water-to-air intercept missile?
It was foolish, it was insane, it was fantastic - but it was their only
hope - and the <u>earth’s</u> only hope!</p>
<p><strong>sir ian</strong>: All ready?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I’ll report to
the Skipper.</p>

<p><strong>wendover</strong>: What’s the corrected bearing to the
Magnetic Pole?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Minus three.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Take over here, Reef.</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Prepare ICBM for firing!</p>
<p><strong>wendover</strong>: Well, that’s all we can do – until our
space-friend decides to blast-off.</p>

<p><strong>carl</strong>: They’re so remote - cold - beautiful, the
stars. But now - I wonder -</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Which is the one - we have to worry about?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: Maybe - just ‘maybe’ - when their ship doesn’t
return - they’ll decide not to come here, after all.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But if they <u>do</u>?</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I wouldn’t worry. So long as we have boats
like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir
Ian and my father -</p>
<p><strong>reef</strong>: And his ‘egghead’ son! We’ll give ’em a
<u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won’t we?</p>
