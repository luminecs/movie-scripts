<p><strong>david lee</strong>: There ain’t no possums in this woods
tonight, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done
drove most of ’em down to the big water country – but if there’s one
left out here – we gotta find him.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: It’s cold, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Here, put my jacket over you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You all right, boy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Dammit! And I remember the time when a
bull couldn’t a stopped him from gettin’ that possum!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Come here, son–</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: It’s all right. He did his job – I just
got foolish for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: If anybody’s to blame, it’s me – I
oughta nailed him when I took that shot.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: It was too dark, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Yeah. We better git back to house
now.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: In all the years me and Sounder been
tracking down possums and coons in these woods – he ain’t tore one of
‘em up yet… He always brought ’em back whole and healthy… And that’s the
difference between a hound dog that’s dirty and mean, to one that’s
great like ol’ Sounder here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: We cornered one, but he got away.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Bet you’re a tired little fellow, David
Lee.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That
possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a
big ol’ shootin’ rifle.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Boy, you don’t make funny with your
daddy like that.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: David Lee…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You had a rough time out there tonight –
so you stay home from that school tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I wanna go – the trip don’t bother me
none.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You learnin’ anything at that
school?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, sir – I learn to write a little bit,
and I can read a lot–</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Readin’ must be somethin’ powerful, huh,
son?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: When the fall comes in these parts, the
Night moon runs away like a rabbit – you could stay out here lookin’ all
night, and not see a thing out yonder.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: We goin’ huntin’ again tomorrow ?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Yep. I guess you must wonder why though,
what with the luck we havin’, but like I always say–</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: “You lose some of the time, what you
always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don’t go afta!”</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Now who says I didn’t lay my mark on
you, boy!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: David Lee, it’s time for you to get to
bed!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Night, son!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: And don’t wake up Josie Mae and Earl!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Your bedtime too, hound dog.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Off you go, boy!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee,
Nathan Lee.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I shore could, Miss Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin
my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that’s worth almost nothing at
the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: The boy is hungry, Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We been through these off-seasons before –
we made it.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: What we make it to? The next season to
work ourselves to death, share croppin’ for ol’ man Howard, so he can
get richer and we can’t even eat when the croppin’ time is done?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: . Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Come on y’all, git up, somethin’s cookin’
in the kitchen! Come on, Earl!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What’s in there, David!?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Sausage and hambones!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama, there’s hot meat on the stove!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Where did it come from, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Where all meat come from – now git yourself
washed up and be snappy about it – you got six miles ahead of you to
that school.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Good mornin’, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Mornin’…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You ready to eat?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I’ll wait till after the children.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: How’s the weather out there?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Little chilly.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Hope it don’t freeze out our baseball
game today!</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Mornin’, Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Mornin’ back atcha!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Don’t forget to save me some!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Sounder!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: That oughta put you in good shape for
tonight!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Don’t take all day at that table, David
Lee.</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school
with David Lee?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Maybe soon–</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: The one thing we got plenty of is
wood!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Ready to go, Mama!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You got two shirts on?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes mam…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: When you get outta that school, you come
right on back home, y’all gon’ have to take this laundry work I done for
Miss Boatwright today.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: ’Bye, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: ’Bye, son…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Where was it you went last night,
Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I went where I had to go, Rebecca. My
children was hungry.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr Clay…</p>
<p><strong>mr clay</strong>: You are one hour late…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yessir…</p>
<p><strong>mr clay</strong>: Well, take your seat.</p>
<p><strong>mr clay</strong>: Now where were we before we were
interrupted– Oh yeah, Huckleberry Finn, chapter thirty-four! This
chapter is called: WE CHEER UP JIM! Here we go: “Tom says: What’s the
vittles for? Going to feed the dogs? The colored boy kind of smiled
around gradually over his face, and says: Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us
dog, too. Does you want to go en look at ’im?”</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: We brought your laundry, Miss
Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Come in, children.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Put it right up on this table,
boys.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: You tell Rebecca ain’t a Chinaman
in all this world can beat her ironing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: This is for your mama’s work, and

of us a nickel apiece!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Who’s winning, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Nobody yet – it’s all tied up.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: If they heard me sing like this up North I’d be
richer than the man I sharecrop for.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: And if they saw me pitch the way I did
today – they’d hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What do they do in the white churches,
Mama?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Same as we – they pray.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: You know, one time by mistake I went into a
white church down in Row County and to this day I don’t know how’n the
devil I got outta that church alive.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: They probly thought you was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I guess so – but I went home and did me some
praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in
Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one
piece.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: What did the Lord tell you, Ike?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: He said, I don’t know, Ike – you doin’ better’n
me, I been tryin’ to git in there for 200 years and ain’t make it
yet!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: If there ever was a devil in this county,
Ike, you is it!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Ike, you could make a song outta
that!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I believe I’ll do just what you say, speed
ball!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Well, this is where I havta say good night to

<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You been knowin’ Nathan for a long time,
Sheriff Young, and you know what kind of man he is, and you know the
trouble we face in these off-seasons.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: Alright, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Don’t take my Daddy! Please don’t take my
Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: David, come back here!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: David!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Mama, why did they take Daddy away?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Because he cared so damn much about you and

<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Is he gon’ be gone long?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Might be…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Sounder… Sounder…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Josie Mae, I’m goin’ into town for awhile
to see about your Daddy – David Lee is gon’ be in charge here, so you
and Earl do just like he tells you.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Watch the fire – don’t go too far lookin’
for Sounder, and warm up some of that corn mush for y’all to eat. If
anybody comes to the house that’s a stranger to you, don’t say
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: ’Bye, Mama…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: ’Bye, son – I won’t be gone long.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been

<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I wanta see Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can’t

<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I don’t understand that, Sheriff Young.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: It’s the rules and I gotta follow
‘em. No visitin’ ’cept holidays and Sunday – and no womenfolk
anytime.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You mean to tell me I can’t see my own
husband?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: That’s the way they do things here in
Landsdown. I just follow orders.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: I’d like to help you, Rebecca. But
all that would do, is git us both in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Will they give him a trial?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff young</strong>: Shore thing – next week sometime, and
as soon as I git the day, I’ll ride out and let you know ’bout it.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta

<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I brought these walnuts to trade.</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: That’s one dollar an’ twenty cents.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I wanta get some things.</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: I hope it ain’t a lot,‘cause I can’t give
you no more credit till the croppin’ season gits back, that is if
Na–</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I didn’t say nothin’ ’bout credit,
Mr. Howard.</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Whatcha wanta order?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar,
and…</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Now what I wanta talk to you ‘bout is
Nathan. He oughtn’ done what he did: sneakin’ into the James’ place and
takin’ they goods. That looks bad on me. I been good to y’all – didn’t I
go to all that trouble to get the people of Landsdown to let your David
Lee go to they school? Didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: And another thing; with Nathan stuck in
jail and all, how you gon’ crop for me when the spring season comes,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Dammit, I’m talkin’ to you, woman! I
gotta farm to think about and I need answers.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard,
and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain’t, believe me – the
children and me – we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you
all that money – Mr. Howard.</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Do you think Sounder is dead, David
Lee?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Will he stay dead?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He ain’t dead, now stop askin’ crazy
questions!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: You don’t havta get mad ‘cause you didn’t
find the ol’ dog!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Somebody’s comin’ here…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: It’s Mama!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae &amp; earl</strong>: Hi, Mama!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Hi, Children – here, take some of these
packages.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Did you see Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No, son. We havta wait ’til the holiday
comes – anyway, they won’t let womenfolk see their men no time.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Can I go when the holiday comes?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You sure can, son…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Any sign of Sounder?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: No mam – I looked all over.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I think maybe he was scraped on the head by
that shot. I don’t think he’s dead – just gone somewhere to heal
himself.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nothin’ in here, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m goin’ use it to put a cake in and I’m
gon’ let David Lee take it to your daddy!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama… Make a chocolate cake… Daddy likes
things that’s chocolate! .</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: Defendant will rise and come before the
bench.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Nathan Lee Morgan, you have been found guilty
of unlawful trespass and robbery – do you have anything to say before
sentence is passed?</p>

<p><strong>judge</strong>: It is the judgment of this court that you be
remanded to the custody of the sheriff of this county and that you be
taken forthwith to serve a term of one year at hard labor at such county
labor camp as shall be hereafter designated. Next case, please…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Be sure to ask your daddy to tell you what
camp they goin’ to send him to. And whatever you do in there, David Lee,
act perkish, and don’t grieve him.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: All right, son, that’s it – now don’t
forget what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: This where you go visit, mister?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Whatcha got there, boy?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A cake for my Daddy.</p>

steel file or hacksaw in it.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s your daddy’s name?</p>

into this cake. Come on, have a piece with your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: We didn’t find Sounder yet.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: He’ll show up one day.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Do you think he’s dead, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Naww – he’ll come back to you, soon as
his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: It’s a shame they won’t let ’em come in
here. If I had the strength I’d knock down these damn walls – if I could
just git my arms ’round your mama right now – is they on this side of
us, son?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I think so…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Dammit! I’m gon’ see ’em if I have to
break my arms!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I can see them! I can see them!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Son, don’t ever let yourself get caught
in a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Can you say what camp they gon’ send you
to, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I don’t know, son – they won’t tell us
things like that – but I don’t want y’all to come here no more.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Why, Daddy; you won’t be here?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Just do like I tell you – I’ll get word
to you through the visitin’ preacher.</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Visitin’ over!</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Come on, boy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Go, son…</p>
<p><strong>harriet</strong>: If this wasn’t a church, I’d do me a dance
to that music she’s playin’.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Why don’t you try it, Harriet, and just see
what everybody would do.</p>
<p><strong>harriet</strong>: Now, Rebecca, I may be a country woman, but
I ain’t no fool.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You determined to get that dance in.</p>
<p><strong>harriet</strong>: Well, you can’t blame a girl for tryin’ if
the feelin’ hits her.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: If I don’t go over there and butt in, I
ain’t gon’ ever get to talk to the Preacher about Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: No, I ain’t got no word yet, Rebecca. I
went to the courthouse yesterday to see ‘bout it, but they just won’t
tell me nothin’ about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I’m sorry,
Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s a shame, Reverend. It’s a damn
shame.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I hope you don’t take to bitterness,
Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who
got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the
misery is, I tell ’em to stay with God.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yeah, he’ll crawl into my bed tonight, lie
close to my body and keep me warm – and rectify the evil in the men who
live over us in this valley.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: It’s not that simple, Sister Rebecca – the
Lord works in mysterious ways – we come into this life with nothin’ and
we’ll leave it with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Is that a blessing, Reverend?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama, did you hear that?!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What is it, David Lee?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Listen, Mama…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama, I hear Sounder!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You come back, boy! I just knowed it! I
just knowed you’d come back!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Poor creature…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He’ll be all right, Mama. I’ll make him
all right.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He eats all right – his throat ain’t
scarred.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Then why don’t he holler like he usta?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He will… Come on, git down and act like a
possum.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t look like no possum!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Act like one!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Git him, boy!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t tell that dog to git me!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I guess I’ll havta work harder to git him
back like he usta be.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why don’t you try and git you a new dog?</p>
<p><strong>mrs boatwright</strong>: David, you never cease to amaze me
at how good you are in taking care of my garden.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: My father taught me…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Would you like to have a cool
drink, David?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: No, thank you – I gotta go do some work
in the field today.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Miss Boatwright –</p>
<p><strong>mrs boatwright</strong>: Yes, David…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Will you help me to find out what camp
they sent my father to?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: The courthouse has rules about
things like that, David – but I’ll ask around town about it.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs boatwright</strong>: David!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, ma’am…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: I’ll find out where your daddy is
for you.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Thank you, Miss Boatwright!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Don’t mention this to anyone! You
hear me, David!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon’
help me find where Daddy is!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Good! But you don’t have to tell the whole
valley ’bout it! You’ll get that woman in trouble!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can’t do it, Rita – that’s the policy
here on colored prisoners, and I ain’t about to change it, not even for
a friend like you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Charlie, just because a man and his
family are colored, you–</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now look, Rita, I don’t make the rules –
you puttin’ yourself on a limb, comin’ here, askin’ me to do a thing
like this. And I be damn if I’m going to jeopardize my job because you
are in love with a little colored boy!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: County Clerk’s office, Charlie Davis
speaking… Yes, sir… You bet your life, sir…Yes, sir, I’ll be right
there.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That was Judge Elliot on the phone and when
Judge Elliot calls, I jump! Good day, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: But, Charlie –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: NO! N-O, NO!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I see you found what you was lookin’
for.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: I did look, Charlie, but I–</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No buts, Rita!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Charlie, you have no legal right
not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and
this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t tell me about what’s wrong. You come
into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you
arrested for that – and if you give out that information to anybody,
that’s exactly what I’m going to do – and I’ll tell everybody in this
town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won’t have
a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: You would do that, wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Let’s get out of here, David
Lee.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You know where my father is, don’t you,
Miss Boatwright?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: No, he was wrong, David, I didn’t
find out.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: But I saw you – you looked in there, and
you found out, Miss Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: If I tell you I didn’t, David,
that’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: But, Miss Boatwright, you–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: I don’t know a damn thing, now stop
bothering me about it!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Come, I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I’ll walk…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Don’t pout now, David, it’s a long
trip.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I’m used to it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs boatwright</strong>: Well, you can’t say I didn’t
try.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Hello, David…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Boatwright… I’m sorry ’bout the
way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs boatwright</strong>: There’s nothin’ to be sorry about,
David – where’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Right here, Miss Boatwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: The camp Nathan is at is called
Wishbone Labor Camp. It’s in Nolan Town!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Miss Boatwright – you shore is a crazy
actin’ woman sometime!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Mama, what was we laughin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: At the way you ask funny questions, Josie
Mae!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: We go from “A-2” – now let me see
where we go from here…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Trouble, Miss Boatwright?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Oh no, these maps are easy to
read.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: There it is, right there!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: How do you get there, Miss
Boatwright?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. boatwright</strong>: Now they have numbers and letters
on here to tell you where to look on the map, but Nolan Town is not
under a number but we know it’s in Northern Landsdown – the number for
Northern Landsdown is: “h7”, but since Landsdown is the largest county,
it actually stretches over into “a2” but “a2” is – Am I making myself
clear?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s clear, Miss Boatwright – it’s so
clear, you don’t havta go any further – thank you – when the time comes
for us to find that place, we will – won’t we, children?</p>
<p><strong>all the children</strong>: RIGHTTTTTT!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Can’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: No, ma’am… Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright
to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: So did I. I figured when the time got
right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it’s not
the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I can do it, Mama – you know that. In the
Bible stories you read to us, everybody’s always goin’ on a long
journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don’t
even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they
supposed to find.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: But you’ll be away from home for days –
what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can’t send
you away from here like that!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama, don’t I always do what you say –
every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright’s
and the woods – you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No, I don’t and I oughtn’t not to after the
way you’ve taken over since they took him away – and I would like for
you to see ’im so you can come back and tell me about ’im. The field’s
all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you
wanta leave?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Can I go day after tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes, son. You better get back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Good night, Mama…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Good night…</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Now afta you go by Nolan, the first road you
come to is Jordan road – keep walkin’ on that road and you’ll run right
into it. It’s a long trip, David Lee, so good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Ike…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t take the dog with you,
David – he’s likely to be a burden to you.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Here’s your food – now you go straight to
that place – if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station –
but don’t go into nobody’s house, you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, mam…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Ask your daddy to give you some word about
when he’ll be comin’ home – and tell ’im we love him.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Tell ’im I said, “Hi”, too, David.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Good luck to you, son… All right now, get
movin’, you losin’ daylight.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver’s voice</strong>: Whatcha got for me today!?</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Same bunch you had yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>truck driver’s voice.</strong>: Well, I’ll take what I kin
git!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mister, can you visit anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Gotta wait ‘til visitin’ days.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: When’s that?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sunday…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee
Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Never heard of ’im. We gotta lotta men
here…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All right, boy, outta the way, truck’s
comin’…</p>
<p><strong>other guard</strong>: Section J comin’ through!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Let ’er roll!</p>
<p><strong>other guard</strong>: Last one comin’ atcha!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Let me have it!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He gotta be on this one, Sounder, it’s
the last truck.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mister…?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Boy, where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I wanta find out ’bout my Daddy. Is he
here?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Can’t you see that guard comin’– git!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Whatcha doin’ here, boy, move!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Okay, Sounder, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Please tell me, mister! Is Nathan Lee
Morgan here?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: There is nobody name Morgan! Now get away
from here before you git us in trouble!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Sorry, Sounder, but we lost. Better keep
movin’ though, ’til we find somebody to tell us how to get back
home.</p>
<p><strong>#1 child</strong>: You new here?</p>
<p><strong>#2 child</strong>: You comin’ here to school?</p>
<p><strong>#1 child</strong>: What’s wrong with that dog?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Come on now, get away from here!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I just wanta wash my hand. It’s got blood
where I hurt it.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You don’t live around here, do you?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: No, mam… I come from way back there. Me
and my dog was tryin’ to find my daddy and we got lost.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Is he here in Borderdale?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I don’t know, he’s in a prison camp.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Here, you put your hand under the water and
I’ll pump for you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: My name is Camille – Camille Johnson and
I’m the Supervisor of this school. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: David Lee Morgan. My dog’s name is
Sounder. That feels better.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Let me see it…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Your hand needs medicine on it. You better
come with me into the school so I can put something on it –</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You keep looking around, David. Don’t you
go to school?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Sometime, but not like this.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: It’s a good thing your hand did not become
infected – how did you cut it like this?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Me and Sounder went to this prison camp
to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some
glass.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Did your mother know you were going to see
your father?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: That does it…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Thank you, Miss Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I don’t live far from here. You and your
dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we’ll
talk about how to get you back home.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I try…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You got a lotta books, too. You got any
books with people in ’em like Huckleberry Finn?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Hell, no!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Here, let me tell you something about the
books on this shelf: This one’s about a man whose name was Crispus
Attucks. He fought in a war to help this country to become the United
States. And this one is about a woman who helped to free slaves. Her
name was Harriet Tubman, and…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: And you say all them people is dead
now?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: That’s right–</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: They lived a long time ago – before you and
I were born.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Come here and I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Here it is, right here.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: That’s where we come from first?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: That’s where we came from first.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: And the other people you told me ’bout,
they is all colored folk?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Colored.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Don’t you teach in your school ’bout folk
who ain’t dead?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Sure–</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Here’s one by a man that’s very much
alive.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Dr. William E. B. Dubois.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What he talk ’bout?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Why don’t you sit and I’ll read you
something he said.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: THE LONGING OF BLACK MEN MUST HAVE RESPECT
– Which means that a man and a woman are human and must be treated that
way– THE RICH AND BITTER DEPTH OF THEIR EXPERIENCE, THE UNKNOWN
TREASURES OF THEIR INNER LIFE–</p>
<p><strong>camille’s voice over</strong>: :–THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF
NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE
THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN…</p>
<p><strong>david’s images</strong>: :The night in the woods with his
father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game
–</p>
<p><strong>camille’s voice over</strong>: :…HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN
THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS…</p>
<p><strong>david’s images</strong>: :HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and
playing in the field.</p>
<p><strong>camille’s voice over</strong>: :…THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE
DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR…</p>
<p><strong>david’s images</strong>: :His visit with his father at the
County Jail house –</p>
<p><strong>camille’s voice over</strong>: :…FINER SPIRITS BOON AND
GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>david’s images</strong>: :His mother, with her head thrown
back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You’re a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: And you’re a tired little boy. I’ll make up
the cot and you must get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What about Sounder?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: He’ll get his place too – now off with your
clothes and into bed.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Now don’t you think it’s time you told me
all about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I have a mother and her name is Rebecca –
My father’s name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Anyone here know what chapter that story
was from?</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Chapter twenty-six!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Twenty-six? The text has but six
chapters!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Now you know I’m not going to have the
laughing!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I’ll get back to you later, Mr. Twenty-six.
Let’s not stop now, we have to keep this mood moving. The story has to
come from one of the text books we’ve already read in class, or it has
to be a true story of your own. Let’s get it going now – we don’t have
that much time left…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I got a story, Miss Johnson – It’s a true
story that happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You know that the class is going to
challenge your story, don’t you, Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yes, Miss Johnson…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Me and my little sister, went down to the
water hole, last Saturday–</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: You’re doin’ somethin’ wrong already – You
didn’t tell us the name of your sister…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: My sister’s name is… Me and my sister,
Laura, went down to the water hole last Saturday and we was playin’
’long the edge of the water and Laura slipped and fell in the water. I
started to run back home, but I turned around, ran back, dove into the
water and got her out before she could drown…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: How was your sister after you pulled her
out of the water?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: She was dirty and wet…</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: What were you doin’, runnin’ away from the
water?!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I was going home to get my daddy.</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: What made you stop and go back!?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Cause if I hadda ran home, by the time I
got back, my sister woulda drowned.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: How come you didn’t know that at first?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I was scared!</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Hold it! Clarence’s story ain’t true! Me and
Clarence been to the river a lotta times, and I know, he can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Clarence, would you tell us a story that
was not true, after telling us it was?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No, Miss Johnson…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Can you swim?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yes mam…</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Clarence, you know you can’t swim! Every
time I tried to show you, you fell down, and I had to always pull you
out!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Is that true, Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yes mam… But when I saw my sister ‘bout to
drown in the water, I tried because I wasn’t scared no more! I was just
swimming and kickin’! I don’t know how I was doin’ it! But I was, cause
my sister was drowning! She was drowning!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I believe Clarence’s story…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You want to come forward and tell us why,
David?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Some people came and took my daddy away
and other people said we couldn’t work the farm. But we had to,‘cause we
didn’t wanna lose our farm. We planted the crops and they grew. I
believe his story ’cause his story is about what he did when he had to
do somethin’. He didn’t know how to swim but he had to or else his
sister woulda drowned. That’s how he did it…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Well, how did you like the class,
David?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: It was the best thing I ever been to,
Miss Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: … So me and Sounder, ran right by the men
that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That’s when I cut
my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin’, and then I
didn’t feel no more hurtin’ till I stopped runnin’! Why was that, Miss
Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Because all you could think of was getting
away from the guard.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Oh… . You right, that’s all that was
worryin’ me right then…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You know, that was a good thing you did for
Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the
other children wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He was real scared nobody would believe
him – I could tell, even when he first stood up.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You could? How?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I been like that myself, when I thought
nobody was gonna believe me… You wanna hear another story?!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Not now, David, it’s time for bed. You have
a long trip ahead of you in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: What are you looking at, out there? There’s
nothing to see.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: My daddy likes to look into the dark,
even when there ain’t nothin to see – it’s what you hear he say.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You think about your father a lot, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes mam…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Well, you shouldn’t worry about him too
much, David.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What do I tell my mama when I get home? I
didn’t find him and that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: But you did all you could, David. Not many
little boys could’ve gone on such a journey as you did.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: But where is my daddy!?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I can’t answer that for you – but it’s no
fault of your own that you don’t know where your father is now. You tell
me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell
me…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Nothin’…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: And so you did your job, right?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, mam…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping,
boy!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What do that mean?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Means you keep me using my head, and that’s
good!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Miss Johnson… Do you think I can come
back here, and you let me study school with the other children?</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Mama! Mama!</p>
<p><strong>josie &amp; earl</strong>: Hi, David! Sounder!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What happened to you? I’ve been worried out
of my life. What’s wrong with your hand, son?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I cut it on some glass and we got lost,
Mama.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Did you find your father?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Didn’t see ’im, Mama. The other men there
say they didn’t know Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I guess they musta sent ’im to another
camp.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What’s that you carryin’?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Some books Miss Johnson gave me.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Who’s Miss Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Miss Johnson is a teacher, and…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: So when I left, she gave me these
books.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Miss Johnson must be a real kindly
lady.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: She is, Mama… When the fall comes, she
wants me to come to her school.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: How can you do that? You don’t live
anywhere near that school.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: She says I can come live with her while
school goin’ on, and come back home every time there ain’t no
school.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: But who’s gonna help me here with the house
and in the field?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: If your father is back by then it’s all
right with me if it’ll be all right with him…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Whatcha starin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Tell us some more ’bout the trip!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: “Dear Miss Johnson. How are you? I am
doing okay. I told my mama, my brother and my sister about you, and they
like you too. I can’t make this letter too long because I have work to
do. Bless you, David Lee Morgan”</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Son, you sure write a good fine letter!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What’s wrong with him, David?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: It’s the heat.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s when the heat is so bad, dogs go
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He won’t go mad – he’s just lookin’ for a
cooler spot.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Who’s that to be fightin’ scorchin’ heat
out in open land like that?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: He’s gone mad! Stop him, David!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Oh my God, it’s Nathan! It’s Nathan!!!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What’s wrong with your leg, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son.
The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my
sentence, and let me come home.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: The most important thing is that you’re
home! We was gonna have cold eatin’ tonight, ‘cause of the heat, but
now, I’m goin’ to cook!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Well, let’s get to it, Miss
Rebecca,‘cause I been waitin’ too long a time for your good cookin’!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: All I can say, Rebecca, is that was some
meal! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m glad you liked it, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Alright, children, it was your bedtime two
hours ago – let’s get a move on you…</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: Goodnight, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Goodnight to you, little girl.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Night, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Goodnight, son…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Son, that was some trip you went on…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Where was you, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: That musta been afta they sent me to
this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin’ camp they sent me
to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin’ to laugh about
to keep from feelin’ the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was
in the middle of the day, and there weren’t no sun – you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Where did the sun go to, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Into the clouds and behind the
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: What happened afta that?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: The rains started to come, and the
prisoners were scared to run ‘cause they had to wait for guards to round
us up, and tell us when to move – but we didn’t mind the rain comin’
‘cause it meant we would git a little rest – we just stood there,
watchin’ the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel
kinda good for a minute. I was laughin’ all over inside – a minute,
that’s all, but what a minute it was!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Daddy, I’m so glad you home!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: And me too, son! You shore done got to
be such a big little man!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: We goin’ huntin’ again, Daddy !?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You bet we is!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while
you was gone…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Your time now, David Lee…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Goodnight, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Goodnight to you, son…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Daddy, you home now… that’s all I want –
I don’t want nothin’ else…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Come here, son…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Mornin’, son…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mornin’, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Where’s everybody?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: They gone to the field…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Guess I can’t just lay here, then.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Thank you, son…</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You feel alright today, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Great, son – not like wakin’ up in jail.
For a minute or two, didn’t quite know where I was, but when I saw your
face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a
good one, and it all belonged to me!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama left somethin’ for you to eat on the
stove–</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Smells good, too!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Hi there, big boy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: They thought one little ol’ shotgun was
gonna stop you – you showed huh, boy!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Down boy! That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Daddy, when is we goin’ huntin’?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Soon – but it won’t be too much huntin’
you’ll be doin’,‘cordin’ to a good little story your mama told me last
night – you’ll be goin’ away from here, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You kept my stuff in real good shape,
son.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Come on, son, throw a couple to me!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Alright, chunk it to me!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Let me have one with a little steam on
it, now!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Boy that was a mean curve you just
threw!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: That’s enough for now, son. I better eat
so we can get out to the field and help your mama before she come
lookin’ for us, and you know how tough your mama can get!</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Hi ya, Rebecca…</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Tired.</p>
<p><strong>mr howard</strong>: Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is
he?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Why don’t you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard?
He’ll tell you all about it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. howard</strong>: I’ll do that, Rebecca… I’ll do that…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: To invite you to his house – the two of you
could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just
shoot the breeze!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Did you tell ’im I was too busy for that
kinda stuff?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Dammit! It shore feels good to be back
home!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Y’all did some good job with the
crop.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Well, let’s get to work!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Yeah. I feel real up to it right now.
Come on, David Lee, you and me’ll do the loading.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I’m real proud of how you helped your
mama to keep this place goin’, David Lee.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Thank you, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I’ll lift up the back end, and you just
hold on to the front end for me.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it
beats goin’ to jail.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You won’t be goin’ to jail again, will
you, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: No, son – they’d have to kill me before
I’d let ’em do that to me again!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Nobody’s goin’ to jail, and nobody’s
gittin’ hurt. Come on, let’s get this one up on the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You hurt, Daddy!?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: No, no, I’m all right, son… This damn
leg just won’t act right no more!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Mama! Mama!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What’s wrong, Nathan?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: He can’t get up, Mama!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: This done happen before. It ain’t
nothin’ – I just have to wait a minute or two.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Is there something I can do to help
you?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Yeah, just stay where you is…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: There, you see?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I see, all right – It’s time for us to get
out of this field.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I just got out here!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk
with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Woman worries too much for me.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You comin’ with us, son?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Hi ya doin’ there, Ike?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Any time it’s Saturday and I don’t hafta do any
work, I’m doin’ okay!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Whatcha got there?</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard’s
place this mornin’ and he had me to bring it over here.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Well, let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Don’t belong to you! It’s for the little
important man, here!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Well, son, who is it from?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: From Miss Johnson –</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Well, ain’t you gon’ open and read it
for us?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Dear David, if you are coming to school
here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin
September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th
of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my
“hello” to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: September 4 – how far away is that?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: ’Bout a week…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Come on, children, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Where you goin’!?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: To the commissary to get this boy some
clothes! I’m gon’ get everybody somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: But, Nathan–</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Don’t tell me nothin’ ‘bout what we owe
ol’ man Howard! I’ll do the owing, and let him worry ’bout the
collecting! Come on, David Lee!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Did you hear me, boy? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You just came back home, Daddy. I don’t
wanna leave right now – I wanna stay home and be with you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: And I wanta be with you, too, but this
school is somethin’ that’s good for you – somethin you need, like good
air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that’s the way it’s
gonna be!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: But, Daddy, you need me here to help you
in the field – Daddy, your leg is hurt – you can’t work like you used
to. Who’s gonna help you!? Who’s gonna do the work, Daddy?!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Let me tell you somethin’, boy! I don’t
care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field,
than you could in a hundred years!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I won’t go, Daddy! I won’t go!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Now wait justa minute! You don’t tell me
what you ain’t gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin’ to that school,
you goin’! You hear me!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Daddy, don’t make me go away from
you.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: David!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: David Lee, come back here!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Nathan!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Please, leave him be, Nathan! He missed you
in a grave way while you was gone – he sweated and worried to find out
where they holdin’ you – went on that long journey – you come home, and
it’s a natural thing for him to wanta hold on to you now.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: David! David Lee!</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: David! You hear me callin’ you!?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: Son, will you listen to me for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: You know, son, when I got this leg hurt,
I was down in a rock quarry, and all of a sudden, there was this
dynamite blast comin’ at me with the kind of force to kill ten men, but
I got outta the way of most of them rock, quicker’n the lightnin’ in
God’s mind – ‘cause I made it up in my head, just that quick to beat the
death that was comin’ at me. And that’s what I’m gonna do with this
trouble in my leg. I’m gon’ beat it. That’s all that’s left for me to
do. That’s what I want you to do. I want you to beat the life they got
laid out for you in this valley.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I was watchin’ your sister and brother
out here the other day, and I said to myself, these is just children –
they ain’t got no business out here in this hot sun… As for me and your
mama, we been in this field so long, we ain’t never known anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: There ain’t nothin’ here but people like
them bastards that sent me away, and tried to kill me. Son, please don’t
get too used to this place. I’m gonna love you wherever you is. Me, your
mama, Josie Mae and Earl, we gonna love you even more. We gonna be at
that school to see you every chance we get.</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I love you, son! Don’t ever think I
don’t love you! We gon’ get to be friends?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, Daddy! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: All right, get a move on you, bag
boy!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You carry your own bag!</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: I’ll carry it, David…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Naw, I’m carryin’ it!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Thank you, Josie Mae.</p>
<p><strong>josie mae</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: For Earl helpin’ me out with my bag!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Be good and be smart, little boy.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: Yes, ma’m…</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: I oughta be gettin’ back here by
tomorrow night some time… Gitttt!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: BYE…!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: BYE…!</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: You know somethin’, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>nathan lee</strong>: What’s that, son?</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: I’m gon’ miss this ol’ raggedy place.</p>
<p><strong>david lee</strong>: But I ain’t gon’ worry ’bout it!</p>
