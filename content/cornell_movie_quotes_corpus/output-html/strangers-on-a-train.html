<p><strong>final draft</strong>: October 18, 1950</p>
<p><strong>for educational purposes only</strong>:
www.screentalk.org</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I beg your pardon, but aren’t you Guy
Haines.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the
court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the
semi-finals, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I certainly admire people who do things. I’m
Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin
which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the
faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it’s corny. But my
mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I don’t usually talk so much. Go Ahead and
read.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It must be pretty exciting to be so
important.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: A tennis player isn’t so important.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: People who do things are important. I never
seem to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I suppose you’re going to Southampton – for
the doubles.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You are a tennis fan.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Wish I could see you play. But I’ve got to be
back in Washington tomorrow. I live in Arlington, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Not now, thanks. I don’t smoke much.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I smoke too much.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Thanks. Elegant.</p>
<p><strong>bruno’s voice</strong>: To G from A. Bet I can guess who A
is.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the sport page
and look at the society news. And the pictures. She’s very beautiful,
Senator Burton’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today’s
stock reports to Li’l Abner, and I got the answer.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Even news about people I don’t know. Like
who’d like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Perhaps you read too much.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: There I go again. Too friendly. I meet
someone I’ like and open my yap too wide. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s all right. Forget it. I guess I’m pretty
jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: There’s a new cure for that. Scotch and plain
water. A pair. Double. Only kind of doubles I play.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’ll have to drink both of them.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: And I can do it. When’s the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: The wedding. You and Anne Burton. It was in
the papers.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It shouldn’t have been. Unless they’ve
legalized bigamy overnight.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I have a theory about that. I’d like to tell
you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the
simplest operation.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I guess I will.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: This is wonderful – having your company all
the way to New York.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: As a matter of fact, I’m not going direct. I’m
stopping off. At Metcalf.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there
for?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: It’s my home town.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to
about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand
in high school and before you knew it – hooked! Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Close enough.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Well, here’s luck, Guy. Drink up – then we’ll
have some lunch sent to my compartment.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Thanks very much. But I think I’ll go to the
dining car. Do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car
now?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Not for about twenty minutes I’m afraid,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: See? You’ll have to lunch with me. Say,
waiter, bring me some lamb chops and French fries and chocolate ice
cream, Compartment D, Car 121. What’ll you have, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Thanks just the same, but I really don’t think
–</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, go on and order.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, I’ll Just have a hamburger and a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: glass in another</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every
time they kicked me out my father threw me back in. He finally gave up.
He thinks I’m awfully small fry, not worth the bait. You my friend,
Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure. I’m your friend, Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No, you’re not, nobody thinks I’m anything
special. Only my mother. My father hates me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You must be imagining things.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: of the bottle for</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, what do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You mean before or after I kill him?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Before, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I want to do everything. I got a theory
you’re supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a
car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Not lately.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I did. I flew in a jet plans too. Zzzzzzzp!
Man, that’s a thrill! Almost blow the sawdust out of my head. I’m going
to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you trying prove?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m not like you, Guy. You’re lucky. You’re
smart. Marrying the boss’s daughter is a nice short cut to a career,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Marrying the senator’s daughter has nothing to
do with it. Can’t a fellow look past a tennis not without being a
goldbricker?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Take it easy, boy. I’m your friend, remember?
I’d do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure, Bruno, sure.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’ll be pulling in soon. I’ve got to change
trains.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What’d you say her name was – your
wife’s?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: That’s it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around
a lot, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s not talk about it any more.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Maybe she’ll make more trouble for you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You mean you got enough on her to get your
divorce no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s change subject, Bruno, can’t we?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my
ideas for murdering my father?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’ve been reading too many of these.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You want to hear about the busted light
socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought
murder was against the law.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But not against the law of nature. My theory
is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn’t you ever want to kill
somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around
with?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You can’t go around killing people just because
you think they’re useless.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, what’s a life or two? Some people are
bitter off dead, Guy. Take your – wife and my father, for instance. It
reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep
at night – figuring it out. Now, let’s say you want to get rid of your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Let’s say she refuses to give you a divorce –
Let’s say. You’d be afraid to kill her because you’d get caught. And
what would trip you up? Motive. Now here’s the plan…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m afraid I haven’t time to listen.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It’s so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet
accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never
saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he’d like to get rid
of, but he can’t murder the person he wants to get rid of. He’ll get
caught. So they swap murders.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Swap murders?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Each fellow does the other fellow’s murder.
Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn’t
there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I
do yours.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’re coming into my station.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: For example, your wife, my father.
Criss-cross.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: We do talk the same language – don’t we,
Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb
chops were a little overdone myself.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Nice meeting you, Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like
it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure, sure, Bruno. They’re all okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Criss-cross.</p>
<p><strong>metcalf railroad station</strong>: as the train comes in.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hi, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>baggage man</strong>: Guy Haines! Good to too you, boy. You
be sure to win at Southampton tomorrow, hear me? I’ve got two dollars on
your nose.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Then park these in a lucky spot for a few
hours, will you?</p>
<p><strong>baggage man</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Even change. Thank you, Madam. Well – hello,
Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re looking well, Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: So are you. You’ve got a nice tan, playing
tennis with all your rich friends.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What time do we meet your lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: What’s your hurry?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My hurry? That’s funny, coming from you! You’re
the one who’s in a hurry, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: When you wouldn’t give me the divorce right
away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I got over being jealous, a long time ago
Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Let’s talk in there.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times,
isn’t it, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Oh, skip it, Miriam. It’s pretty late to start
flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you’re going to have
another man’s baby.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Do you know, I think you’re handsomer than
ever?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s see your lawyer and get this over
with.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Did you bring the money, Guy? Lawyers are
expensive.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: If I’d known what all that tennis nonsense
of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn’t have run out on you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out
with it.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I’m not getting a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn’t want
this divorce, you did. That’s what you’ve been harping about for the
past year.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: It’s a woman’s privilege to change her mind…
Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn’t want you to be
ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky
parties.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And what do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Don’t look so mad, Guy. You always smile
when your picture is being taken for the papers.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Especially when you have Anne Burton hanging
on your arm.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s not talk about Anne Burton.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: So, it’s really serious between you two?
Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I’m
coming to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: To have my baby and be with you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Why me? It’s not my baby.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: But people don’t know that, Guy, do they? It
would make a pretty story, wouldn’t it – the senator’s daughter involved
with a married man who’s about to become a father.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You black conniving little liar!</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What happened? Did he run out on you?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: No man runs out on me. Not even you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re a liar and a cheat, Miriam. You’ve
wanted to get rid of me long enough and now I’ll go you one better – I
never want to see or hear of you again.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I could be very pathetic as the deserted
little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe
you?</p>
<p><strong>med. shot through glass partition from hargreaves’
viewpoint</strong>: We see Guy gripping Miriam’s arms and apparently
addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his
words. The smile has faded from Miriam’s face and something like
cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and tense and seems to
cower beneath Guy’s rage.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: …That’s what should happen to people like you.
And if I…</p>
<p><strong>hargreaves</strong>: Break it up, folks. This isn’t the place
for a family quarrel.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sorry. I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can’t
throw me away like an old shoe. I’m coming to Washington to have my
baby. Tell that to the senate!</p>
<p><strong>ext. metcalf station</strong>: Guy comes into the scene,
crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one. Inside the
telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a
nickel in the telephone, speaks into it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Long distance. I want Washington, D. C. The
number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Anne, – Anne darling. Yes, I’m in Metcalf – No,
everything didn’t go smoothly. She doesn’t want a divorce, not now….</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: with unpleasant</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure I sound savage. I feel savage. I’d like to
break her neck! I said I’d like to break her foul, poisonous, useless
little neck! What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: Since you insisted on a manicure,
dear, I do wish you’d keep your hands quiet. You’re so restless
lately.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: he admires the free</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: Did I file them too short?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No, Ma. They look fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: Then what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m all right, Ma. Don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: You look so Pale, dear. Are you out of
vitamins?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I bought a bottle of them yesterday. A whole
fifth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: But you have that ‘look’. I can always
tell. You haven’t got into any more mischief, Bruno?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: I do hope you’ve forgotten about that
silly little plan of yours?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: About blowing up the White House?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I was only kidding, Ma. Besides, what would
the president say?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: You’re a naughty boy, Bruno. But you
can always make me laugh. Now get shaved, dear, before your father gets
home.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m sick and tired of bowing and scraping to
the king.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: Now, now, Let’s not lose control. Come
see my painting, dear – I do wish you’d take up painting. It’s such a
soothing pastime.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re wonderful, Ma! It’s the old boy, all
right. That’s father!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: It is? I was trying to paint Saint
Francis.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: They are ready with your call to
Southampton, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: How nice that you’re early, Charles.
I’ll tell cook….</p>
<p><strong>mr. anthony</strong>: Just a minute, Eunice. Bruno! Come
here! I want to talk to you and your mother.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Sorry father. Long distance. Hello…</p>
<p><strong>mr. anthony’s voice</strong>: Now it’s hit and run driving!
And you knew about it all the time!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Guy? Bruno, Bruno Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>mr. anthony’s voice</strong>: You’re going to protect him
once too often. After all we do have a responsibility to society.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I just wanted to ask how you made out with
Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What? Metcalf? Who’d you say you were?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Bruno, Guy. Bruno Anthony. Don’t you
remember? On the train.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anthony</strong>: I never permit it!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Are you getting your divorce?</p>
<p><strong>mr. anthony’s voice</strong>: I tell you he should be sent
somewhere for treatment before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: So she double-crossed you! Are you going to
see her again?</p>
<p><strong>mr. anthony’s voice</strong>: I tell you, Eunice, I’m going
to have that boy put away if it’s the last thing I do!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hello Mrs. Joyce. Warm, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. joyce</strong>: That it is.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’ve been reading where your son-in- law’s
been coming right along at tennis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. joyce</strong>: We don’t have any interest in tennis any
more.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. joyce</strong>: Don’t you stay out too late, Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Goodnight, Mother. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>semi-close up</strong>: The small boy pointing the gun fires
it twice with a couple of ‘bangs!’ He then starts to move off.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Come On, Miriam. Come On!</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: George, stop it, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: George, no!</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: Miriam!</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Is your name Miriam?</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Why yes. How did you –</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: The screen is filled with one of the
lenses of the glasses. They are of the diminishing type. Against the
moonlit sky we see reflected, the elongated struggling figures, as
though we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one of the figures falls
forward.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Miriam! Miriam! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>long shot lake</strong>: Bruno’s boat throbbing its way
across toward the landing stage.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Hey, here she is! What’s the matter with
her? Has she fainted?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She is dead!</p>
<p><strong>other voice</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Got a cop!</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: There was a man, now please take note.
There was a man who had a goat. He loved that goat, Indeed he did. He
loved that goat, just like a kid. What is your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’ll never make the Metropolitan.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Name’s Collins. On sabbatical - Delaware
Tech. Glad to meet you. I jus’ gave a speech in New York. On
integration. In the differential calculus a function is given and its
differential is obtained. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Y’do?</p>
<p><strong>lap dissolve to:</strong>: The taxi comes to a side street
and stops outside a small apartment house.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Guy!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Over here, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>two shot</strong>: Guy frowning in puzzlement as he looks at
Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Hello, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What are you doing here? At this time of
night?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You don’t seem very pleased to see me,
Guy.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I brought you a little present.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Recognize them?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It was very quick, Guy. She wasn’t hurt in
any way. It was all over in no time.</p>
<p><strong>bruno’s voice</strong>: I know you’d be surprised. Nothing
for us to worry about. Nobody saw me, only Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I was very careful. Even when I dropped your
lighter there, I went right back to it up. If It’d been found, it would
have ruined our whole scheme, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Are you trying to tell me you’ve – Why, you
maniac!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the
train together, remember?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Where do you think I’m going? I’m going to call
the police, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But you can’t, Guy. We’d both be arrested for
murder.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’d both be arrested for murder?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re is much in it as I am. We planned it
together. Criss-cross. I do your murder –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You crazy fool! You think you can get away with
that?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, come now, Guy. Why should I go to Metcalf
and kill a total stranger, unless it was part of the plan and you were
in on it? You’re the one that benefits, Guy. You’re a free man. I didn’t
even know the girl.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let me go, Bruno. I had nothing to do with this
and the police will believe me.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: If you go to the police now, you’ll just be
turning yourself in as in accessory. You see, you have the motive.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My telephone.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Someone has some news for you, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Tell them you know about it already, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’ve got me acting, like a criminal, you
crazy fool!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Don’t you call me that.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You must be tired, Guy. I know I am. I’ve
sure had a strenuous evening.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Now look, Guy, about my father. I have the
plans made. Two plans. A plan of the grounds and a plan of the house. I
have in old Luger I bought at a pawn shop in San Francisco. My father
–</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Wait a minute, Guy. To have to talk. We have
to arrange things.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Get away before I give you what you gave
Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re not yourself, Guy. You’re tired. When
you think things over, you’ll see I’m right. Tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know you. I never saw you before. I
never want to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But we have to –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes? Yes, Anne. I’m sorry, darling. I just got
in. Of course I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But you sound upset. Is anything wrong? All
right. I’ll come over. Right away.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Anne darling, you’re trembling.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy – I wonder if you know how much I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Brazen woman. I’m the one to say that.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But I wanted you to know, before… Before we go
into the living room.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Good evening, sir. Hello, Babs.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Something awful has happened, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Sit down, Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: There seems to be no way of diplomatically
breaking tragic news. I’m sorry, Guy, to be the one to tell you. It
concerns your wife. She’s been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The police have been using everything but
radar to locate you.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: You’re to call Headquarters at Metcalf.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Miriam…murdered.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: She was…strangled.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: It happened on an island in an amusement
park. It was sort of a lovers lane, I believe. A rather sordid
atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Miriam went there with two boys. They were
the ones who found her. So they’re not suspects. But you probably will
be.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Young lady, we can’t overlook the fact that
murder is at our doorsteps. But I forbid you to drag it into the living
room!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Let’s not fool ourselves. The police will
say Guy wanted Miriam out of the way so he could marry Anne. In a crime
of this sort the police first go after the husband, and Guy had every
motive.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Motive?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: She’s right. Whichever way you look at it…I’m
in a spot.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Oh come now, my boy. I’m sure you have
nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: If he hasn’t an alibi for nine-thirty
tonight he has plenty to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You can tell them where you were, can’t you,
Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: At nine-thirty I was on the train from New York
to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone?
You’ll need a Witness, you know.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes, I spoke to someone.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Anyone you know?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No. His name was Collins. He is a
professor.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: University of Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then everything’s’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Not quite. Detectives play a game called
Motive, Motive, Who’d got the Motive.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m sick of hearing that word!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He’ll still have to answer questions.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Routine. Pure routine.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m afraid there’ll be a lot of reporters at
your front door in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Daddy doesn’t mind a little scandal. He’s a
senator.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It can’t be helped, darling. It is not your
fault. It’s not as though anyone can say you had something to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Someone might say it…I’d do anything to keep
you all out of this mess.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Profit by my experience, Guy. Never lose
any sleep over accusations. Unless they can be proved, of course. We’ll
help all we can. Dreadful business, dreadful. That poor unfortunate
girl.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She was a tramp.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: She was a human being. let me remind you
that even the most unworthy of us has the right to life and the pursuit
of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: From what I hear, she pursued it in all
directions.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Barbara!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Father, it’s getting terribly late, and Guy
looks so tired…</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Of course, of course. Back to bed,
Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, you two. Nothing stands in your way
now. You can be married right away. Think of it – you’re free!</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: One doesn’t always have to say what one
thinks!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Father, I’m not a politician.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: You won’t forget that call, Guy? Captain
Turley.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes sir. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I still think it would be wonderful to have
a man love you so much he’d kill for you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I told myself over and over I was being silly,
but there was one horrible moment tonight when the news came through. I
kept remembering what you shouted telephone from Metcalf.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That I could strang…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t even say it. Forget you ever said it.
Even more terrifying than the murder itself, Guy, was the awful thought
that if you had anything to do with it we’d be separated, -perhaps
forever. I’d never see you again. I couldn’t bear it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Captain Turley’s office?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Captain Turley is expecting me. Guy Haines.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Just a moment, Mr. Haines.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. joyce</strong>: You’ll pay for this!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant’s voice</strong>: Will you come in, please,
Mr. Haines?</p>
<p><strong>captain turley</strong>: Good of you to be so prompt,
Mr. Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell. Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain turley</strong>: I know you’re a busy man, so we
won’t detain you any longer than necessary…Now you already been good
enough to tell us where you were last evening, and we’ve managed to
locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes. I saw him outside.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Will you come in please, professor?</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: Professor Collins, this is Mr. Haines. He
was with you on the train last night.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, but I really don’t
remember meeting this gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>closeup professor collins</strong>: He turns from the captain
to Guy.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Unfortunately, I remember very little about
the journey from New York…You see, there had been a little celebration
–</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: But we were sitting opposite each other in the
observation car! You were singing a song about a goat –</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: A goat?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And calculus. You were going over a speech
you’d made.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: I was? I’m sorry, Mr. Halnes. I certainly
must have celebrated! I can’t remember you at all.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Captain, is it so important whether or not
Professor Collins remember me? Surely, the important thing is that I’ve
been able to name a man who was on the train with me. You’ve been able
to find him. Isn’t that proof of where I was at nine-thirty last
night?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hello, darling. Have you had your dinner?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: On the train.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You weren’t in Metcalf all this time? We
expected you hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I didn’t. They sometimes throw a suspect in
the can and keep him there all night.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Sit down, Guy. Sit down. Give him some
coffee, Anne.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: You had no trouble with the police of
course, once they verified your alibi?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: When an alibi is full of bourbon, sir, it can’t
stand up.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You mean the professor was boiled?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Completely. He didn’t remember me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But, you knew he was on the train! Wasn’t that
enough to prove you were on it, too?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Apparently not at the right time. They
suggested I could have caught the train at Baltimore after Miriam was
murdered. They had it all worked out – in their timetables.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: and increasingly</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: trying to be herself, and defers</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I certainly hope so. What is your next
step?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Whatever it is, the police will know it. They
gave me a present – come take a look.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My guardian angel.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’re being tailed!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s Leslie Hennessy. He works sixteen hours
a day. Somebody else takes over for the next eight. As a matter of fact,
Hennessy’s a very nice fellow.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Shouldn’t we ask him in for Coffee – or
something?</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I’ll have him called off immediately of
course.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’m afraid where I go, Hennessy goes. Even to
the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Is he likely to – picket my office?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Very likely.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I would suggest, Guy, for your own peace of
mind, of course, that you work here at the house for a few days. It
would be less embarrassing for you.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Then what about practicing? Perhaps I’d better
forget Forest Hills?</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: My dear boy, wouldn’t it look rather –
awkward – if you suddenly canceled all your plans.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He’s right, Guy. You mustn’t do anything that
would look suspicious. You’ve got to carry on as though nothing has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: A call for you, Mr. Haines. They say it is
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hello –</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Hello, Guy. I tried your apartment, but –
Why, Guy, this is Bruno!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Must be some mistake. It wasn’t for me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, I suppose I was pretty lucky to be seeded
fifth, really.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: I’ve never seen the Forest Hillss
tournament before. I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Do you mean we’ll be going there together,
Hennessy?</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Oh, don’t worry. This thing will be
cleared up by that time. Ever thought of turning professional, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I won’t have to do that. When I’m through with
tennis. I’ll be going into politics, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Politics! It’s a good thing for you I
don’t report that to the chief.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy’s voice</strong>: If he knew you were getting into
that rat-race –</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: – He’d put ten men on your trail. He says
–</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s take this cab. It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Pentagon Building, please.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Oh, no, not there! I always get lost.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, we’d better be getting back.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’ve actually been alone for an hour. Seems
almost indecent. You like?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I like.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I was beginning to feel like a goldfish.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: So was I. When we build our house, darling, we
won’t even have glass windows. No doorbells, no newspapers, no telephone
–</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No Hennessy.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How long can it go on?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know. I suppose until they find out who
did it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: We’ll be happier then, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Guy!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Will you stop pestering me!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But Guy, you haven’t called me. My father’s
leaving for Florida the end of this week –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You crazy fool! There’s a detective outside.
He’ll see us together!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, they can’t have anything on you. Isn’t
that Anne Burton? Slight improvement over Miriam – eh, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Stay away from me, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who was it, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I never saw him before. Just some tennis
fan.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Here’s a special delivery, Mr. Haines.
It’s marked personal.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Are you getting in any practice today,
Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: large folded sheet of paper and glances</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Barbara, who are you waving
at?</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: Mr. Hennessy. I think it is a shame
Daddy won’t let us have him in the house to sit down. Have you met him
yet, Louise?</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: He is awfully cute.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Is anything wrong, Mr. Haines?</p>
<p><strong>closeup guy</strong>: Her voice breaks his reverie. He
answers her with a forced smile.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, thank you, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>first woman</strong>: I didn’t think he’d show up after what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: And miss all the publicity?</p>
<p><strong>closeup guy</strong>: He looks across at the watching
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>player’s voice</strong>: Ready, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>med. shot passageway leading to terrace</strong>: We see Guy
coming alone, having fInIshed his game. He is carrying his rackets,
wears a towel around his neck, etcetera. He walks into foreground, into
CLOSEUP, and suddenly stops short at what he sees:</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy, darling – this is Mr. Antony – a friend
of Monsieur and Madame Darville… Guy Haines.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time,
Mr. Haines. In fact, I follow everything you do.</p>
<p><strong>mme. darville</strong>: Mr. Antony has been telling us such
charming stories… Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: Guy!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ve just been talking to your shadow. Guy,
did you know Mr. Hennessy helped crack that axe murder I was reading
about? You know, the one where the body was cut up and hidden in the
butcher shop? He was locked in the ice box with the left leg for six
hours!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He pulls those yarns right out of his hat,
Babs.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Who’s the nice looking Frenchman with the
Darvilles?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He’s not French. His name’s Antony.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How do you do, Madame Darville.
Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>french couples’ voices</strong>: Delightful to see you. How
sweet you look, Miss Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I hope you aren’t forgetting our little
party on Thursday, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>mme. darville</strong>: We are planning on it?</p>
<p><strong>m. darville</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: This is my sister Barbara. Barbara, this is
Mr. Antony.</p>
<p><strong>closeup a luger pistol held in guy’s hands</strong>: CAMERA
PULLS BACK TO SHOW Guy staring down at it. He is partially dressed for
an evening party, in black bow tie but without his jacket. He leans
forward to take up a letter from among brown paper wrappings on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hiya, Hennessy. Won’t keep you out late
tonight. With Forest Hills coming up tomorrow, I’ve got to get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: That’s too bad. Hammond takes over in a
couple of hours. I’d like to see him earn his salary.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Doesn’t that bloodhound over relax? He sticks
so close he’s beginning to grow on me – like a fungus.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: He thinks you’re a very suspicious
character. He doesn’t trust anybody! Not even himself.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come on. Don’t forget your sleeping bag.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Yeah, If I have to wait too long on the
sidewalk my feet get cold. And if I sit too long on those stone steps,
my –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t worry. Since you told Barbara Burton
about the icebox, you’re her favorite charity. She’ll send the butler
out with something to defrost you.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Cute kid.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you so much, Mr. Lindsay. We’ll look
forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator.
He gives a slight bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to
Anne.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Good evening, Miss Burton.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: This is Mr. Antony, father.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: How do you do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’d like to talk to you sometime, Senator,
about my idea of harnessing the life force. It will make atomic power
look like the horse and buggy. I’m already developing my faculty for
seeing millions of miles. And, Senator, can you imagine being able to
smell a flower on the planet of Mars? I’d like to lunch with you some
day soon and tell you more about it.</p>
<p><strong>dowager</strong>: So nice to see you, my dear Senator.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Ah yes, indeed – I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I don’t remember inviting that young man.
Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: A friend of the Darvilles.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: He has an unusual personality.
Provocative.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But tell me, Judge, after you’ve sentenced a
man to the chair, isn’t it difficult to go and eat your dinner after
that?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Young man, when a murderer is caught, he must
be tried. When he is convicted, he must be sentenced. When he is
sentenced to death, he must be executed.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Quite impersonal, isn’t it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: So it is. Besides, it doesn’t happen every
day.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: So few murderers are caught.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very
interested in the subject of murder.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No more than anyone else. No more than you,
for instance.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Me? I’m not interested in
murder.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, come now, everyone’s interested in that.
Everyone would like to put someone out of the way. Now surely, Madame,
you’re not going to tell me that there hasn’t been a time when you
wanted to dispose of someone. Your husband, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Good heavens, no!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Ah ah! Are you sure? Do you mean to tell me
there wasn’t a tiny moment - when you’d been made really angry? And what
did you say?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: There you are, you see! There you are! All
right, now you’re going – to do a murder. How are you going to do it?
This is the fascinating part – how are you going to do it…I didn’t get
your name?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Mrs. Cunningham.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Mrs. Cunningham, how are you going to do
it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Well, I suppose I’ll have to get a
gun from somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Tssk, tssk. Oh no, Mrs. Cunningham.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Bang, bang, all over the place. Blood
everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: What about a little poison?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Ah! That’s better, that’s better. Mrs…..?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson</strong>: Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: That’s better, Mrs. Anderson. But
Mrs. Cunningham is in a dreadful hurry. Poison could take…let’s see…ten
to twelve weeks, if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die from natural
causes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: I have a wonderful Idea! I can take
him out in the car and when I get to a lonely spot, knock him on the
head with a hammer, pour gasoline over him and over the car and start
the whole thing ablaze.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: And then have to walk all that way home?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No, I have the best way, and the best tools.
Simple, silent, and quick. The silent part being the most important. Let
me show you what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: toward Mrs. Cunningham’s throat, then stops a
moment</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cunningham</strong>: Well, it’s not for long.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh! no. Now, when I nod my head, just see if
you can cry out, and I bet you can’t. Now with my two thumbs…you see
that’s where I’ll be able to prevent any sound coming from you. Now,
just wait for the nod of my head.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. anderson’s voice</strong>: Mr. Antony! Mr. Antony!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Stop him! Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>closeup</strong>: Bruno’s wrists and hands and the neck of
his victim. We can just see Mrs. Cunningham’s chin at the top of the
screen. Her head is tossing from side to side. Her hands are clutching
at Bruno’s wrists. The hands of the other two women, also in the
picture, are pulling at Bruno’s wrists. Mrs. Cunningham’s hands begin to
slide off. Her head drops back.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Stop him! Help, somebody! Pull him off!
Mr. Antony! Mr. Antony!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Bring him this way.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Bring her upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I thought he was a bit weird when he
arrived. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I hardly know him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Get him out of here as soon as you decently
can – will you. This is a nice item for the gossips. First thing you
know, they’ll be talking about orgies. I’d better get back…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: What happened? I was on a merry-go- round
somewhere. It made me dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You’re a mad, crazy maniac, and you ought to be
locked-up! Now will you get out of here and let me alone?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: But, Guy –</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You shouldn’t have done that, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Come on – pull yourself together. Do your tie
up.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Here – let me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Have you got a car here?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Driver’s outside.</p>
<p><strong>int. hall medium shot</strong>: One or two of the guests turn
their heads as Guy takes Bruno across to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What’s the matter, Barbara? Did you see it
happen? Did you see it – all?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He looked at me! His hands were on her
throat, but, he was strangling me!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He was looking at her first. Then he looked
over at me. He went into a sort of trance He looked horrible! He thought
he was murdering me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Anne, why me? Why me? What did I have to do
with it?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Do you know where Guy is?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He went out with that man!</p>
<p><strong>closeup anne</strong>: She calls out urgently:</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You didn’t meet him for the first time the
other day, did you, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You mean when you introduced us at the
club?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes. Did you notice how he stared at Barbara
that day?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, I didn’t – particularly –</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He stared at her again tonight – while his
hands were around Mrs. Cunningham’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What did Miriam look like, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, why do you ask me? You’ve seen her
pictures in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Go on, I want you to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, she was dark, not too tall, rather pretty
–</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What else is there?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: She wore glasses, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: She looked a lot like Barbara, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How did you get him to do it, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I get him to do it?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He killed Miriam, didn’t he? Tell me, Guy!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes. He’s a maniac. I met him on the train
going to Metcalf. He had a crazy scheme about exchanging murders. I do
his murder and he do mine.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What do you mean – your murder, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, he’d read about me in the paper. He knew
about Miriam – and about you. He suggested that if he got rid of Miriam
for me, I should kill his father.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You must have realized he was talking a lot of
nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Of course! I didn’t give it another thought.
And now a lunatic wants me to kill his father.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s too fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You mean you’ve known about Miriam all this
time?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Since the first night. He gave me her
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why didn’t you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And have them say what you did – “Mr. Haines,
how did you get him to do it?” And Bruno would say we’d planed it
together.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Guy – what can we do?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I don’t know, Anne…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy, hadn’t we better go inside? Your friend
Hennessy’s watching us.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You see, Anne, that’s why I didn’t want you to
know anything about this. I wanted to protect all of you – your father,
Barbara. And now that you know, you’re acting guilty, too.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, if we could only talk to father or someone
about it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, that’s no good, Anne. I mustn’t drag anyone
else into this mess. Come on. Let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Hello, Hammond.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: You look worried. What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: You’d better keep on your toes. Something
funny’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Bruno? Yes, yes, it’s Guy…I’ve decided to do
what you want. I’ll make that little visit to father…. Tonight. Yes, I
want to get this thing over with, can you leave the house again, Bruno?
You’d better stay out till daylight.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Guy leaves the gates ajar and then,
taking the plan of Bruno’s house from his pocket, and the key, he looks
toward the house.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Mr. Antony!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Mr. Antony! Don’t be alarmed – but I must talk
to you about your son. About Bruno. Mr. Antony!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Yes, Mr. Haines?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: My father isn’t home tonight, Mr. Haines. I
was about to tell you that over the phone. But you came to such a sudden
decision. I wondered why.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Since you sent me a key to your house, I
decided to use it – to make a little social call on your father. I
thought he’d be Interested to know he his a lunatic son.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in assuming
that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No intention whatsoever. I never had.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I see. You won’t have any further use for the
key, then, Mr. Haines. Thank you very such.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Or this.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Look, Bruno. You’re terribly sick. I don’t know
whether it’s possible for you to realize it or not. I don’t know much
about these things, Bruno. But why don’t you go someplace where you can
get some treatment? Not only for your own sake, Bruno, but you can’t go
on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I don’t like to be doublecrossed.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I have a murder on my conscience, but it’s
not my murder, Mr. Haines – it’s yours. And as you’re the one to profit,
I think you should be the one to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, I guess it’s no use, Bruno. We sees to
have nothing further to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m not going to shoot you,
Mr. Haines. It might disturb mother. I’m a very clever follow. I’ll
think of something better than that. Much better.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: He came back at three twenty-five. I didn’t
even know he’d given me the slip until his ’phone kept ringing for about
half an hour. Nobody sleeps that sound. So I got the janitor to let me
in. No Haines.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Wonder where he went?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: We’ll probably hear of another dame
murdered.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Shut up. I’d better contact Metcalf. I
should think this calls for more questioning of Mr. Haines.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Questioning? Nuts! Let’s take him in.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times do I
have to tell you that we have nothing conclusive on Haines? There’s no
evidence that he was ever at the scene of the crime. Can’t you get that
into your thick head? Now stay put till I get back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. antony</strong>: Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I know
Bruno’s been in some very awkward scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous as
a murder.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But, Mrs. Antony, you’ve got to make him do
something about this. Don’t you see that just one word from him would
extricate Guy from this dreadful situation?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. antony</strong>: Oh, but Miss Burton, I’m sure this
thing must be some practical joke. You know, Bruno sometimes goes too
far. Of course I shouldn’t be saying this to an outsider, but sometimes
he’s terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But don’t you understand, Mrs. Antony – your
son is responsible for a woman’s death.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. antony</strong>: Did Bruno tell you this?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Of course not, Mrs. Antony.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. antony</strong>: Well, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. antony</strong>: Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice of
you to call. You must excuse me now. I must get back to my painting. Do
you care for painting, Miss Burton? I find it so soothing. You must come
again sometime.</p>
<p><strong>bruno’s voice</strong>: Oh, Miss Burton!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m afraid mother wasn’t very helpful, was
she? You know she hasn’t been well for a long time. She’s a little – how
shall I say – confused. Poor mother.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You know, I’m very upset with Guy. He
shouldn’t have sent you on an errand like this.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy doesn’t know I’m here, Mr. Antony.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: He’s been leading you up the garden path, I’m
afraid. He must be very desperate to try to involve me. I’ve been
protecting him ever since we had that conversation on the train and he
told me how he hated his wife.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he tried to
get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his
lighter so the police wouldn’t find it? He dropped it there, you know,
when – well, that night.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: The whole thing’s been worrying me so much.
But of course I couldn’t do it, Miss Burton. It would have been too
risky. And besides, it would have made me an accessory.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Miss Burton, I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I have an
urgent appointment. I must go up and change. Now, I really must go…if
you’ll excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>med. shot a terrace near the main stadium</strong>: where
people get refreshments. There are various table with umbrellas.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …And he said that if the police found your
lighter there, that’s all they’d need – something to prove you were at
the scene of the murder.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That big lie about my wanting him to get it
back means he’s going to put my lighter on that island!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy, you’ll have to get there before he does.
You won’t have time to play, You’d better tell them.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Darling, if that loudspeaker announces that I’m
not going to play, Hennessy bound to be suspicious He’d keep me from
ever getting near Metcalf.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: No, darling. You stay right here and help me
give Hennessy the slip after the match.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But, Guy, that’ll be too late!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Didn’t Bruno say that I wanted him together
there one night after dark?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, that’s what’s in his mind now. He’s not
going to expose himself in broad daylight, If I can finish off this
match in three sets, I’ll still get there in time.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: We’re on in a few minutes, Guy. How are
you, Miss Morton.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay, Tim. Be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Well, if Turley said to pick him up for
questioning, let’s pick him up!</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Let him have his game first, Hammond.</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: This is the first time I ever waited for a
murder suspect to play tennis before I pulled him in. When the boys it
headquarters heir about this they’ll send me orchids.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Good luck, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You got it straight? Just make sure Barbara has
everything ready as soon as the third set starts.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: –It looks like an interesting match with
Haines constantly charging the net – not like Haines at all – to press
so early in the game…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Well, at least there’d be a trip to
Australia, if you made it.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: We’ll know more about that by the end of the
week…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: They’re close to the finish, Guy</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Be right there. I was afraid you wouldn’t get
here. Wish me luck, darling.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy, listen to me, If I sound all mixed up I
can’t help it. I – I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s just it. I don’t know. It’s Bruno. I
talked to him, Guy –</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He acted peculiar – as if he could put the
murder right in your lap, and not involve himself at all.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He’d drag himself into it, – and Bruno loves
Bruno. I’m all right so long as he thinks I have an alibi for that
night. He knows?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Then he’ll think of something. He said he
would.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy, has he anything that the police could
trace to you – Any little thing.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My cigarette lighter. He said once he could
have left it on the islands as evidence But he wouldn’t do that. Not in
broad day light.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But he’s going somewhere, Guy. He told his
mother –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Metcalf – did he say Metcalf?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No, – I don’t think so. Oh, why can’t I
remember – he said such crazy things!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Try to think, Anne!</p>
<p>****: Guy Haines! – Reynolds!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Something about the moon – he said he had an
appointment with the moon.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s no help. But I can’t take any chances.
I’ve got to get that lighter – somehow.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Okay, Guy. We’re on.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I’ll have to default.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And have Hennessy and that other one right at
your heels?</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: First time I ever waited for a killer to
play tennis before I nabbed him!</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: When the boys at headquarters hear about
this they’ll send me an orchid!</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: We got our orders. We take him in – after
the match.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Good luck, Guy!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The moon! You said he had an appointment –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Then he is going to Metcalf. But he has to wait
until it gets dark – Listen, Anne, as soon as the third set starts, tell
Barbara –</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: It looks like an interesting match – with
Haines out to blast Reynolds into a fast fight, – not like Haines at all
– to press so early in the game…</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Stupid game. You’d never get me into them
short pants. I’d feel naked.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: You’d feel naked in an Eskimo suit – if
you weren’t wearing your badge.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Haines wins the first set.</p>
<p><strong>umpire’s voice</strong>: Game to Mr. Reynolds. Games are two
all…Second set.</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Game to Mr. Reynolds. Games are three all…
second set.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: May I have a light, please?</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Second set to Haines. Haines leads two sets
to love.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: If he wins this next set – you’d better have
everything ready. Here – give the driver this ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I wish understood what this is all
about!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You don’t have to understand, just do it. And
for heaven’s sake, act natural.</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Love fifteen.</p>
<p>****: Love thirty.</p>
<p>****: Double fault. Love forty.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: – Haines hasn’t let up his terrific pace
for an instant, smashing every</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: ball with a recklessness we’ve never seen
in his playing. It’s beginning to look as if he doesn’t care whether he
wins or loses because he’s in a hurry - an awfully big hurry —</p>
<p>****: Game to Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds leads five games to three in
the third set.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Down there – my – my cigarette – case. It’s
very valuable.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Down here?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’ve got to get this grating up right
away.</p>
<p><strong>first passerby</strong>: What’s the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Can’t we do something…! I dropped my
cigarette case.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Mightn’t be any good, mister. Probably gone
down the storm drain.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Storm drain?</p>
<p><strong>first passerby</strong>: On the other hand, it might have
lodged on the edge.</p>
<p><strong>second passerby</strong>: Don’t they have a trap down there –
like under a sink?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Don’t just stand here – do something!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Guess we could phone the city engineer, all
right.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Worst he could do would be to tell me to
take a running jump and – Relax, mister.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I don’t want to relax.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: This is more than a tennis game, ladies
and gentlemen – it’s a desperate fight with Guy Haines playing as if his
life depended on it!</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Game to Mr. Haines. Mr. Reynolds leads five
games to four…third set.</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Advantages, Mr. Haines.</p>
<p>****: Duece!</p>
<p>****: Advantage, Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>closeup anne</strong>: unable to bear the suspense. She
glances O.S.</p>
<p>****: Score is deuce.</p>
<p>****: Advantage, Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: – Haines hasn’t let up for a moment. If
he wins this set, he wins the whole match!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Isn’t it wonderful, Mr. Hennessy? He won!
It calls for a celebration. Anne says you must have dinner with us. Just
the family, and you, and Guy.</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Sorry I can’t make it. Business.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: But Guy is your business. You’ll be with
him, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: Yeah – I’ll be with Guy.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Guy says you love steak – rare, Medium, or
well-done?</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: I sure wish I could –</p>
<p><strong>hammond</strong>: Hennessy!</p>
<p><strong>hennessy</strong>: If you’ll pardon us, madam, we need your
help. We’re chasing a man.</p>
<p><strong>dowager</strong>: How exciting.</p>
<p><strong>dowager</strong>: and calls to the</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: You sure must think a lot of that –
Whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The amusement park, quick.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Amusement park.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: The killer is here tonight. So keep your
eyes open and the minute you see him, let us know.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>close shot bruno</strong>: gives a quick glance back, sees
Guy then he turns and looks off in another direction.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Haines! Hold it! Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: The detective fires at Guy.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I want to get off of here! Let me off of
here! It makes me dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Stop it, Bruno. Give me my lighter, Bruno!</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: indicating the merry-</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: There he is! That’s the one! That’s the one
who killed her!</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: Of course he is. We know that.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Get somebody to come and stop that
thing!</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Hey! Be careful! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>2nd detective</strong>: Well, do you want to do it
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>1st detective</strong>: No. I think he’ll make it all
right.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Guy wrenches himself out of this
position. He rolls away from the CAMERA right to the edge of the
merry-go-round. He manages to grab a rail.</p>
<p><strong>long shot from high angle</strong>: The merry-go-round his
keeled over. For a moment we don’t know who has survived. There is a
surge of people milling and shouting. Those who have jumped back out of
the way when the merry-go-round toppled, now rush forward again as the
cloud of dust settles. From the midway in the background others are
running forward.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Get back. Get back there. Give us room
here.</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: Are you all right, Haines?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Mr. Turley! Mr. Turley! He says this
isn’t the man we want. It’s the other one – the one he was fighting
with.</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: full attention to this unexpected bit</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: No, I didn’t, sir. I’ve never seen this man
before in my life. I meant the other one.</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: What is this all about, Haines? Did you know
he killed your wife?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He has my cigarette lighter and wanted to plant
it there on the island to pin the whole thing on me. Let me talk to him.
Let me show you. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>another detective</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: This one’s in a pretty bad way,
Mr. Turley.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Can’t you get that stuff off him?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: No, they’ve done everything they can
until the crane comes.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Hello, Guy.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: This is Mr. Turley, Chief of Police.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: So they got you at last, eh, Guy?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Can you talk a little? Can you tell the chief
you have my lighter?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I haven’t got it. It’s still on the island
where you left it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I think he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>detective’s voice</strong>: He’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: Is this your lighter, Haines?</p>
<p><strong>turley</strong>: Well, you were right. I’d better keep this
for the time being. We can clear the whole thing out the morning. How
about staying in town over night, Haines? I imagine you have a lot to
tell me. Nine o’clock, all right?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Okay, Mr. Turley. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Can you tell me where there’s a telephone?</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: There’s one up near the entrance. Who was
he, Bud?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Bruno. Bruno Antony. A very clever fellow.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hello… Yes, operator, yes! Guy?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: closes her eyes with heartfelt relief.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Guy’ll be back tomorrow. He wants me to take
him some things.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He says he looks silly in his tennis
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I presume from all those tears that you
have had good news.</p>
<p><strong>cleric</strong>: I beg your pardon, but aren’t you Guy
Haines?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yes.</p>
