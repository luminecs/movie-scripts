07 /0 5/ 88 PM Re v. 07 /2 5/ 88 April 27, 1988</p>
<p><strong>1 long basement corridor 1</strong>: The CAMERA is MOVING
SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor. We hear a narrator –</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell
Julius Benedict the truth about himself…</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: It wasn’t that he was the product of a
scientific experiment.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: An experiment designed to produce a
physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained
that to him when he was two years old.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. medical exam room - half a dozen men - day 4</strong>:
Most of them young, 20s and 30s. They are being given a medical
examination by a group of doctors, including Werner.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: And it wasn’t the complexity of Julius’s
parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn’t have just
one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: Nor was it about the extraordinary woman
chosen to be his mother…</p>
<p><strong>6 int. hospital hallway outside delivery room - 6</strong>:
Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head. Werner tries to enter the room –
Traven won’t permit it.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: Julius had long lived with the tragic news
that she died giving birth to him.</p>
<p><strong>7 omitted 7</strong>: &amp; &amp; 8 8</p>
<p><strong>9 int. hospital hallway - delivery room - day 9</strong>: As
a nurse, parting the security guards, emerges and holds up a plump,
serene, smiling baby boy.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: What Julius didn’t know, until this very
moment, was that, about a minute after he was born…</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: His mother gave birth to another baby…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I have a brother?!!!</p>
<p><strong>12 int. greenhouse - day 12</strong>: A greenhouse on the
island.</p>
<p><strong>12 continued: 12</strong>: Werner, now 70, is bent and old.
Julius, in peasant garb is a marvelous-looking human being.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles.
At the same time I brought you here to the island.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I have a twin brother?!! What’s his
name?</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent – Every time I loved something I
called it Vincent – I called my first computer Vincent! I have to find
him!</p>
<p><strong>b13 ext. island - cliffs - day b13</strong>: Julius strides
along a windswept path, followed by Werner. The ocean spread out below
them is vast and empty. This island is far from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: You’ve been here since you were a baby – you
know nothing of America –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I know it is the cradle of democracy and the
land of the free; besides, I speak twelve languages – I’m sure I can get
a job.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: They’re a simple people; rather primitive,
not like us.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: My brother will look after me.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. julius’s hut - day 13</strong>: It’s a blend of
modern technology and the tropical environment – floor-to-ceiling
book-cases, computers, a hammock shrouded in a mosquito net.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: It’s your only copy –</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: – My need for it is only sentimental – yours
may be practical –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Thank you – I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>a14 ext. tropical island a14</strong>: The water’s edge.
Julius, Werner, an OLDER LADY, two scientists and an ORIENTAL man are
all saying goodbye. Julius puts his suitcase into a small rowboat.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: It’s sixty miles to the airport, Julius;
be careful.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: It was an honor to study under you,
Master.</p>
<p><strong>oriental</strong>: Ahhh, always on guard. You have learned
well, Julius-san.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I was just thinking, maybe my brother
Vincent is married.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to
marry him, she might have a sister who’d feel the same way about me.
That often happens with twins, you know.</p>
<p><strong>werner</strong>: Julius – please – don’t get your hopes up.
Your brother doesn’t even know you exist.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: disappears in the</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You sleep well, honey?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Mmmm… like a baby.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Me, too. I love this new mattress. It’s soft
but it’s hard at the same time. And I love this new clock.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You’ve done a great job on this room,
Carla.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You really think so? Even the curtains?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: The curtains are the key to the whole thing.
They’re colorful… they’re brilliant… they’re… great curtains.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You were great last night, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Naaaw… I think we’re going to be very happy
here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Honey! I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What’s he doing back so early?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Carla? You gonna cook me some breakfast or
what?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Be right down, sweetheart!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hurry up! I gotta make breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You’re wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn’t
deserve to kiss your feet.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. balcony - day 15</strong>: Vince steps out and
jauntily climbs over the rail. It’s very clear he likes the danger,
being on the edge. In another life, he was probably Errol Flynn. Now, he
gives Carla an Errol Flynn smile – – and with that, he leaps into
space!</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. al’s house - mustang - day 17</strong>: As Vince gets
in, starting to sing.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: ‘Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a
beautiful day’…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: … ‘everything’s going my way’…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Carla, what a joy to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Is my partner and best friend, Al home from
work yet? I am the bringer of good tidings.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Stop with that horrible song, you know how I
hate birthdays; they’re worse than Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Carla and I figured, since you were always
admiring mine, what the hell…</p>
<p><strong>18 continued: 18</strong>: Vince struggles to contain his
delight at this irony.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: A lighter, just like yours. I don’t know what
to say, Al. I’m all choked up.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hello – the Greco residence… sure. Who may I
say is calling… Mr. Burt Klane? Vince, it’s for you –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you’re having
a wonderful – Yes – no problem – I have it. Yes. Today. Of course.
’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What are you doing talking to a loanshark?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s part of my good news – You know that
money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well, I put the money in
the stock market. I got this incredible tip.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I can’t lose. Ever hear of P.V.T. Industries?
Probably not – Secret takeover bid –</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You put the money on a stock?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: A very special stock – and it was such a sure
thing – I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in
the stock market?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: On margin – And as of last night I was ten
thousand ahead. I’m going to make a fortune – turn on the T.V.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. newsroom - close - tv - day 20</strong>: Cable news –
stock report.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … that Wall Street’s suffering its worst
single-day’s losses since October ’87. Hardest hit were Federated
Broadcasting, down $18, Waverton Data, down $24 and P.V.T. Industries,
down $32. Analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain
immune to…</p>
<p><strong>21 int. al’s house- day 21</strong>: CLOSEUP ON the extremely
worried face of Vince as he takes in the bad news.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You are having one shitty birthday, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m wiped out. I got to get some money –
fast.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Well… ’88 B.M.W. came in for long term last
night…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t you think you’re doing this too
often?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m a desperate man.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Level three. Stall 25.</p>
<p><strong>22 omitted 22</strong>: thru thru 27 27</p>
<p><strong>b28 int. airport parking structure - day b28</strong>:
CLOSEUP ON a large painted number 25 then PAN DOWN to reveal a new BMW.
Vincent approaches the BMW and pretends to be searching for his keys
while he waits for another car to pull out and drive away. The second
it’s gone, Vince deftly opens the BMW door with a “slim-Jim.” He gets
behind the wheel, hot wires the ignition and drives away. Vince is a
pro.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This is only four thousand –</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: We’re in a recession – Everything’s tough –
you want to try someone else – no hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: You okay, Vince? You seem a little
worried.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and
I never sleep alone. I’m doing great!</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. airplane - day 28</strong>: Flying through clear,
blue skies.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. airplane - on stewardess 29</strong>: Coming down the
aisle, checking the passengers, as we hear:</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: ‘Put on your red dress, baby ’Cause we’re
going out tonight…’</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: seated in the rear, still in his peasant
garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on
and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head
bobbing.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: ’I better wear some boxing gloves, In case
some fool might want to</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I knew you were trouble the second I
laid eyes on you.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Sorry – I’ve never heard this music before –
I love it.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: The captain wants us to buckle our seat
belts because we’re expecting a little turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Thank you, Betty Lou.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I bet you’re a football player.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Actually, I’m a horticultural botanist, a
mathematician, and a philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Right. And I’m a brain surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>hijacker</strong>: Nobody moves, or else we’re gonna have a
serious draft in here. Get the captain. I want to discuss our final
destination.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: turns to the terrified elderly woman beside
him who’s clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Excuse me, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor
and –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: His mischief shall return upon his own hand,
and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head – Psalm
7:16.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. lax terminal - late afternoon 32</strong>: Julius
exits the terminal surrounded by Orientals. He makes his way to an
airport shuttle bus.</p>
<p><strong>34 int. bar - day 34</strong>: As Vince sidles into a booth,
watched by a BARTENDER who clearly dislikes him.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: It’s him. He’s back.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Marnie! How are you? Is your sister
around?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You total Linda’s car. You pawn her stereo.
You declare us as dependents on your tax return!?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What an amazing memory –</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Vince! I knew you’d come back!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I am so sorry for all the miserable things
I’ve done to you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Linda!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m not going to give him any money. Just
take care of my station for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I didn’t come here for a loan, sweetheart. I
came to say goodbye. It’s not safe for me here. People are trying to
kill me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What did you do, Vince?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I got involved in the stock market.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I promised Marnie I wouldn’t give you
money.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Don’t look at me like that… Don’t do that
with your eyes… I shouldn’t even be here with you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of
people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for
you… Linda. I only have eyes for you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That is so beautiful. How do you make up that
stuff? You’re such a poet.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You inspire me.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It’s the baby Klane – I gotta get the hell
out.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Where’s the little shit?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You gotta be more specific, considering our
clientele.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He wouldn’t show his face around here. Right,
Marnie?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Who, Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: – That weasel, that creep – that oily little
slug – that two-bit, two-timing, waste of space – that pathetic,
low-life pocket Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Okay – enough.</p>
<p><strong>b37 int. bar - day b37</strong>: Vince is thrown in,
forcefully, into a table. He crashes onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>bob klane</strong>: Look what I found crawling around out
back.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: This is only four thousand –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: The rest is invested. We’re gonna make a
fortune.</p>
<p><strong>bob klane</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>c37 continued: c37</strong>: Linda comes over – Very nervous,
she looks around, then hands over an envelope.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I hope this helps – Please don’t hurt
him.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: There you go – – Another thousand – Okay
– This nice lady just bought you a day Vince – I want it all – Twenty-
thousand – this time tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Twenty – ? But I just paid –</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: That’s just the interest. The twenty’s
the principal.</p>
<p><strong>37 int. bar - near door - day 37</strong>: Linda is walking
Vince out.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That was the most wonderful birthday present
anybody ever gave me –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s your birthday? Why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I can’t take the kindness. It gives me the
shakes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’ll tremble plenty before we’re through,
Vince Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>a38 ext. grauman’s chinese theatre - magic hour a38</strong>:
Vince brushes himself off, hesitates a moment, pulling on his left ear
with his right hand.</p>
<p><strong>closeup on julius</strong>: And you can see it on his face:
He loves it.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: … How wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>39 omitted 39</strong>: thru thru 43 43</p>
<p><strong>44 ext. hollywood - night 44</strong>: Julius, eating a hot
dog, is walking along a street in Hollwyood. In his island peasant garb,
he doesn’t look all that unusual considering his surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>44 continued: 44</strong>: But Julius is pretty noticable no
matter where he goes.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What an amazing country.</p>
<p><strong>biker #1</strong>: ROARING up beside Julius, smiling
ingratiatingly.</p>
<p><strong>biker #1</strong>: Got a light, pal?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Sorry, but I don’t smoke… pal?</p>
<p><strong>biker #1</strong>: Looking for something for your girl
friend?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I… don’t have a girl friend. Do women really
wear these things?</p>
<p><strong>biker #1</strong>: If you’re lucky. You from out of town?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Yes, a small island in the South Pacific,
about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji…</p>
<p><strong>case handle</strong>: Julius’s hand holds fast to it. Then
–</p>
<p><strong>biker #2</strong>: As his mouth drops open as we –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: just sort of standing there, no big deal,
not much effort showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise
into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then –</p>
<p><strong>riderless cycle</strong>: ending its trip as it collides with
a storefront and collapses on its side, MOTOR still ROARING but no
movement anymore and –</p>
<p><strong>cyclist #1</strong>: stunned, going to his unconscious
partner.</p>
<p><strong>biker #1</strong>: What the hell did you do?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I did nothing, the pavement was his
enemy.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I would say – a concussion – a mild shoulder
separation, and ribs</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Get him to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: And in the future, you should both consider
wearing helmets.</p>
<p><strong>45 omitted 45</strong>: thru thru 47 47</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Fifty-three dollars? You gotta be
kidding.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Your vehicle’s in a handicapped zone.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: So? Do I look normal to you?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You don’t have a ‘handicapped’ sticker on your
windshield. Driver’s license, please.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You’ve got over 200 outstanding parking
tickets, Mr. Benedict. And you just had your birthday? Well, your
driver’s license just expired – Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>48 continued: 48</strong>: As we HOLD ON Vince’s depressed
face we FADE TO BLACK –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: So, this is where my brother grew up. I’m
glad he had so many friends to play with.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. orphanage dormitory - day 50</strong>: An elderly
MOTHER SUPERIOR looks dubiously at Julius as he stares out the window
down on the playground. He turns and examines the dormitory which is
lined with metal cots. He points to a cot near the door and smiles
fondly.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: And that’s where he must have slept.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: It’s the one I would have chosen. It’s next
to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the
alarm, and saved the other orphans.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: We’ve only had one fire at
St. Charlotte’s. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by
accident.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. mother superior’s office - day 51</strong>: The
Mother Superior opens a file cabinet and begins rummaging through it,
watched by Julius.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete?
Did he like chess and poetry?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I’m certain that God had a purpose
when he created Vincent Benedict, but it had nothing to do with chess or
poetry.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: That’s odd… the contents of his
file are missing.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: This is him? He looks happy –</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: He should – that’s Sister Maria,
his biology teacher.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I always liked biology.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister
Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our
library fund and ran away.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. orphanage - front door - day 52</strong>: The Mother
Superior is trying, tactfully, to close the door on Julius.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: But I have to find him. Where do you think
he might be?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Jail. A man of his character could
only be in jail. You’re full of goodness, Julius – I pray that you never
find him.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. los angeles jail - holding cell - day 53</strong>: A
bunch of people are in the cell along with Vince. Most noticable is an
amazingly tall, slender, muscular black man. We’re talking a SEVEN
FOOTER here. A bad tempered Seven Footer.</p>
<p><strong>seven footer</strong>: What’re you lookin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: At you, you jerk.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven
rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year. First round pick of the
L.A. Clippers and now look at him.</p>
<p><strong>seven footer</strong>: amount of</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: World International Athletics Representation.
Vincent Benedict – President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you
wouldn’t have to heist T.V. sets for a living –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Benedict! Visitor.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Call me when you get out, they’re always
looking for centers in Italy…</p>
<p><strong>54 int. jail - visiting room - day 54</strong>: Julius is
already seated in one of the cubicles, separated by a glass partition
from the prisoner’s side. This is a big moment for Julius and he looks
around as various prisoners are brought in – – and as a look of pleasure
comes across his face –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: leading an attractive, powerful inmate into
the room. The guy is Julius’s age.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: trying to fight his excitement, watching as
the prisoner moves toward him – – then past him.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Excuse me, but I’m looking for Vincent
Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got ’im.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: bit rambling; his emotions are in</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You gotta talk into the phone, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: listening, somewhat amazed. Who is this
loony?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: … Dearest Vincent…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I know you don’t know who I am, but – I came
halfway across the world –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay
the money back. You tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a
man when he’s already in the slammer is beneath even them –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – I don’t know any Klane brothers. I’m your
brother, Julius.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Huh? Again?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I don’t know any Klane Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Yeah. Go on – I got that part.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: My name is Julius – I’m your twin
brother.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Obviously – the minute I sat down I felt like
I was looking in a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’re not identical twins.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I wouldn’t be too sure.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You don’t believe a word I’ve said, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – That’s right. I don’t believe a word you
said.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent, I don’t lie. I am your brother. Let
me help you get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Oh… you want to help me get outta here?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well, money talks, bullshit walks.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: How can bullshit walk? Is that slang?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m in fast company here – Listen, you get me
outta here, I’ll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew,
niece, grandma…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Just don’t ask me to bend over –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Listen, ‘twinny,’ I hope you didn’t blow your
wad on those tickets, ’cause it’s gonna cost a bunch more to release my
car.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I have some more money –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I am happy to help you, Vincent. You’re my
brother. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Julius – look – ease up on the love talk or
I’m gonna be tossing my cookies, all right?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Tossing cookies, that is more slang?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Just gimme your wallet, okay?</p>
<p><strong>56a ext. police impound office - day 56a</strong>: As Julius
counts out almost the last of his money to the police attendant, who
hands him a set of keys. Vince grabs them and walks out of the building.
Julius follows.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I know what you’re thinking?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You’re thinking that this whole twin
business is what you call ‘bullshit.’</p>
<p><strong>57 continued: 57</strong>: This is exactly what Vince has
been thinking.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Actually, I was thinking I’m going to need
some more money – to put gas in my car –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You can take some more money –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I can?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We’re brothers – right?</p>
<p><strong>a58 ext. impound parking lot - day a58</strong>: Vince and
Julius are walking down a long line of cars.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: They arrest you, they put you behind bars,
they fine you and then they hide your car.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: That’s – – your car, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>vince’s mustang</strong>: Which is what Julius is pointing
at.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Yeah – How’d you know that was my car.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’re twins!</p>
<p><strong>a58 continued: a58</strong>: Vince unlocks his side, gets in.
Julius, smiling and happy, starts to walk around to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m so excited – we’ll go to museums
together, discuss philosophy together, read books together – play chess
together –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Get lost together –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Deserted, alone in the sea of cars.</p>
<p><strong>58 ext. airport - parking lot - day 58</strong>: As a
gleaming new Cadillac rolls up to the ticket booth. Al leans out from
the booth, taking in the car and its occupants – two men, one in a
Hawaiian shirt, one in a tanktop, both wearing Ray-Bans. They look like
they’re going on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Hey, the new Sedan DeVille… Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh? Catch
that good surf.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: There’s plenty of space on level four.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. parking lot - inside cadillac - day 59</strong>: as
it pulls into a parking spot in the enclosed lot. Man #2, LARSON, opens
an attache case, removes a cassette, inserts it into the tape deck while
the driver wipes down the steering wheel, gearshift, etc. with a cloth
to remove their fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>outside cadillac</strong>: as the men get out, lock the car,
wipe off the door handles, and then head for the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>wholesale patio furniture</strong>: His door opens and out
come two furniture MOVERS with a desk.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What’re you doing with my desk?</p>
<p><strong>mover</strong>: Taking back the furniture – you’re six months
behind.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. vince’s office 60</strong>: Almost nothing is left
but the phone on the floor, with Miss Busby, his secretary, standing by
it. Vince is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>miss busby</strong>: I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It was time to redecorate anyway.</p>
<p><strong>miss busby</strong>: Vincent Benedict, Incorporated – Sports
agent, artist’s representative – import/export – automobile sales,
rentals, and leasing – wholesale patio furniture – How may I help you?
Oh, hi. It’s Al.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Miss Busby – Stacy – this is a transition
period for the corporation – Why don’t you take a few days off.</p>
<p><strong>miss busby</strong>: … Aah – all right. Whatever you say,
Mr. Benedict…</p>
<p><strong>miss busby</strong>: Oh, before I forget… Happy birthday…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: ‘Aqua-Velva’ – you shouldn’t have –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I hope you got some good news, Al –</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Brand new Caddy on level four.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Great, I’ll be right over.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: Time’s up, Vincent – Got the
money?</p>
<p><strong>63 continued: 63</strong>: He bends over, picks Vince up by
the neck like a toy doll, straightens him up briefly, then buries his
fist into Vince’s gut. Vince goes down. Harder than last time.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.
He finally manages to look up at the giant –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Did you hit me yet? ‘Cause I didn’t feel
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: He grabs Vince again.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: You gotta understand something,
Benedict – I like my work.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: These are most unfriendly acts you are
committing.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I don’t know what the problem is, but I’m
sure it can be solved without resorting to violence.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You moved too soon.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: An important rule in a crisis situation –
negotiate first, attack last. You never negotiated. You don’t know what
kind of enemy I am.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We’re twins.</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: You’re firewood.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You have no respect for logic –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – And I have no respect for those with no
respect for logic. You’re a very stupid person.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both
hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a
pause.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: As he heaves Klane across the corridor into
the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut
and…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Tell your brother ‘He messes with me, he
messes with my whole family!’</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I like it when you hit people!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I hate violence.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: But you’re so good at it. We ought to go into
business together. You could be a boxer and I’ll be your manager.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I don’t think I could fight for money.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No problem. You do the fighting, I’ll keep
all the money.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m worried about you, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: How much money do you owe? Don’t lie – we’re
twins, I can feel your pain.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Why do you keep saying that? We’re not twins,
we’re not brothers, we’re nothing, and you’re only in this car because I
could use a little protection these days –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Twenty thousand?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Due this morning.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I don’t know where my head is – I forgot I
promised this friend of mine – Sammy – I’d pick up his car at the
airport – do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport
for me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What are you doing with that finger?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Learning to drive.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. parking lot - day 65</strong>: Vince checks beneath
the caddy’s tires, then rises, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That dopey Sam – He did it again. Forgot to
leave the keys… A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really
disappointed…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Handicapped children?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This car was supposed to be auctioned off at
their charity drive tomorrow. Oh, well, let’s go eat.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Maybe we should try to open it
ourselves…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You think we should do a thing like that?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Of course – it’s for the children…</p>
<p><strong>closeup - slim jim</strong>: Vince inserts it into the
Cadillac’s driver’s-side window, watched by Julius.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I saw a guy from the auto club do this
once…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Whaddya know? Beginner’s luck!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots
inside –</p>
<p><strong>65 continued: 65</strong>: First, the car tilts and Vince is
pitched unceremoniously forward, landing on the floor of the car under
the steer- ing wheel. He scrambles back to the seat – it’s not easy
because of the angle. Second, the SIREN STOPS. Vince looks out the car
window.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: When the back end is raised to an angle
greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff
system. The alarm’s computer thinks the car is being towed away and
shuts off.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No shit…</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. los angeles street - magic hour 66</strong>: The
Cadillac passes by, Vince at the wheel. A pause. Now the Mustang comes
along, Julius at the wheel. He drives terribly, stopping and starting –
jerking along. Julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past
Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent Benedict’s car. Vincent! Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Ya see that little dot in your rearview
mirror? That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Hi, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: There’s a supermarket up ahead. Take your
foot off the gas and very – very – very gently put it on the brake.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: The brake – right.</p>
<p><strong>b67 ext. supermarket parking lot - dusk b67</strong>: As
Julius makes a sharp turn – on two wheels – into the parking lot and
comes to a dramatic squealing stop that spins the car around 180
degrees. Vince’s car pulls in a moment later. He gets out, gazes at the
skid marks as a smiling Julius approaches.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: The brakes worked just fine!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Lemme tell you something about America,
Julius – nobody likes a smart-ass.</p>
<p><strong>linda and marnie</strong>: are pushing a cart down one of the
other aisles. Linda is filling it with birthday candles, cake mixes,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Angel’s food or devil’s food?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: The answer’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s only one Vince Benedict. He’s a force
of nature.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: And that ‘poetry’ he pretends to write.
They’re old song lyrics, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know that – Geez, you don’t think I know
that – ? It’s so cute, the way he thinks he’s tricking me. Anyway,
what’s wrong about other people’s songs? Some guys tell you dirty jokes.
It just proves that Vince has a romantic soul.</p>
<p><strong>magazine rack</strong>: Adjacent to the express checkout lane
where Linda and Marnie now join the line. Julius picks up a Playboy and
begins speed-reading it. His eyes widen at what he’s reading, and
seeing, and when he reaches the centerfold he audibly gasps.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: She’s not bad…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m sorry. I had no idea these magazines had
things like that… inside them.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You didn’t? Where’ve you been? A desert
island?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: As a matter of fact, a small tropical
island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest
of Fiji. I only got here yesterday, but already I’ve found my wonderful
brother.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Your brother?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: My twin brother, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: God you look beautiful in this light.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vince… ? I didn’t know you had a brother.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You all know each other?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Julius, meet Linda and… Her charming sister,
Marnie.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Sisters?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Twins?</p>
<p><strong>b68 outside the supermarket b68</strong>: The girls stand
holding their bags while the brothers are each in their cars.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Goodbye girls, see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Goodbye girls, see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’ve only been drivng for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Why do I think I’m going to see him again?
Like maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. vince’s home - night 68</strong>: Vince leads Julius
from the garage to the front door. Julius is carrying all the grocery
bags.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Linda is your girl friend, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Yeah. Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Is Marnie your girl friend, too?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to
like you.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: She hardly knows me.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s the best way – women love men who are
mysterious and devious. It keeps them on their toes – makes them excited
you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You do like women, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Very much, they’re… strange and sensitive
and they have compassion. I have the highest respect for women.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Now correct me if I’m wrong. You’re a virgin,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: That’s private.</p>
<p><strong>68 continued: 68</strong>: Vince clocks Julius’s reaction as
he removes an eviction notice from his front door.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He’s a 230-pound virgin.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. vince’s house - night 69</strong>: It’s a small
one-bedroom decorated primarily with garden furniture. As they come
inside, Vince is confronted by a reproachfully MEOWING CAT.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes!
‘Liver and Cheese,’ ‘Chicken Giblets,’ all your favorites, Julius.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You named your cat, Julius?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is
adding a little extra cheese. I know you’re probably used to growing
your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the
mainland we just nuke it!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Dinner is served!</p>
<p><strong>70 continued: 70</strong>: They both freeze and stare at each
other for a long beat. Julius smiles and we –</p>
<p><strong>parking spot</strong>: It’s definitely empty.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: He looks at the Cadillac key. Clearly, he
is not happy at the turn of events.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: So, let me get this right. One of our fathers
was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T.
–</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: He won the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Naturally… so all of our dads were these big
shots and Mom was, like, Superwoman, but she didn’t survive our
delivery. I got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a
tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for, but who doesn’t
actually pay you because you don’t need money. Did I leave anything
out?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I think it’s important we try to find our
fathers.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You mean, all those geniuses who contributed
to the… … Sperm milkshake?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Why are you being so immature about
this?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Do you know how many times I’ve heard stories
like this? It’s every orphan’s fantasy: ‘My real Mom and Dad were rich
and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched
with another baby… But one day there’s going to be a knock at the door
and there they’ll be with open arms, crying… “My darling! My treasure!
We didn’t know! How can we make it up to you?”’ I’m telling you this for
your own good, Julius. It’s a crock.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I liberated this from my file at the
orphanage. Read it and weep.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Dear Sister Anderson, your request for
orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our
files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for
her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent’s case seems to be
one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s right, Julius, she abandoned me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: This letter was written thirty years ago. We
were five years old – Our mother… didn’t die when we were born… You’ve
known all this time where she was and you never contacted her?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I don’t know about your momma, Miss Perfect
of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she’s still alive, I hope she’s
in a lot of pain. She dumped me once – no way she gonna get a chance to
do it again –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for
all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must
check this address.</p>
<p><strong>73 continued: 73</strong>: He can’t hide the excitement.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Julius – slow down – I’ve got no time for
this. You go hunt down Mom, I’ve got a cash flow problem to deal
with.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: We haven’t forgotten about you, Benedict
– You better have our money tomorrow morning. Or else.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Or else what?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Everyone seems so angry in America.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. aerospace plant - establishing - day 74</strong>: A
sign in front reads: “SOUTHLAND AEROSPACE.”</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: The tests on the lower temperature gaskets
look great.</p>
<p><strong>larson</strong>: Looks like an easy weekend.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Garfield, there’s a…</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’m Webster, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: on the sound of the name. He looks at
Larson. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>larson</strong>: Christ, man, you were never supposed to come
here.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: The deal was we were never supposed to
meet. You’re supposed to be…</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Driving that Cadillac to Texas? Got my
driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat… but no car.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: The car was there! The merchandise was in
the trunk! Your instructions were on the cassette!</p>
<p><strong>larson</strong>: He wants more money. That’s what this is
about.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Let me explain something to you. I have a
reputation to uphold. People put their trust in me because they know I
always deliver the goods and I always come back with the money. This
whole thing is making me look very bad… professionally.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: This is bullshit! The car was there.</p>
<p><strong>larsen</strong>: That’s right. The parking attendant thought
we were off for Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: The parking attendant?</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: He liked the car. We’d put on those damn
loud shirts so we’d look like tourists –</p>
<p><strong>larsen</strong>: He asked us if we were going surfing. He was
a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You know, I just realized that in twenty
years of service no other client has ever seen my face.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: I don’t think that’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>78 omitted 78</strong>: &amp; &amp; 79 79</p>
<p><strong>80 int. reception area - day 80</strong>: As Webster emerges
from Garfield’s office and then turns back as if to say goodbye, watched
by Garfield’s Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Thanks for everything, guys. I’ll see what
I can do about those Laker tickets. Yeah, I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: They want you to hold their calls. They’re
going to be working late.</p>
<p><strong>81 omitted 81</strong>: thru thru 87 87</p>
<p><strong>a88 ext. winding road - day a88</strong>: As Julius jogs
steadily uphill, checking the occasional house number against the
address on Vince’s letter.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m terribly sorry to disturb your party and
I realize this might sound strange, but I’m looking for someone who
lived here a long time ago… Mary Anne Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: She was my mother.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: You’re Mary Anne’s son?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Isn’t that you, Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Why don’t you go help your grandma with
lunch, honey?</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: They told your mother that you died at
birth…</p>
<p><strong>d88 continued: d88</strong>: Julius studies them admiringly
while Granger looks at the group photo.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: I guess you could say I’m your father…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: One of my fathers –</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: ‘Mary Anne Benedict’… I haven’t said her
name aloud for over 30 years. She was the love of my life. The times
I’ve wondered what would have happened if I’d married her…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: She turned me down. Said she was afraid to
have children. She took it real hard when they told her you died. She
even stopped painting. Did you know she painted?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Until yesterday I didn’t even know she might
still be alive… Who told her we died?</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: ‘We’?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I have a twin brother, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: There’s two of you? She never knew that,
either.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Mitchell Traven. He supervised the
experiment for the government.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: He’s the one responsible for all of this.
He still runs the genetics lab at Los Alamos, New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’ll go see him.</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Watch out for him – he’s kind of a
dickhead, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No, I don’t – but I’m learning.</p>

<p><strong>90 ext. chop shop - day 90</strong>: As the Cadillac enters
through a gate and makes its way past the hulks of dead cars towards the
same body shop we saw earlier.</p>
<p><strong>garfield</strong>: Mr. Webster, I hope you’re happy with the
vehicle we chose for your little journey. When you get to Houston, phone
713/555-0342 and ask for Beetroot McKinley. He will arrange to trade you
a briefcase for the merchandise in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>91 continued: 91</strong>: Vince stops the car dead, the Body
Shop Owner comes up to him.</p>
<p><strong>body shop owner</strong>: New Caddy? Let’s check it out.</p>
<p><strong>body shop owner</strong>: The car’s okay – I’ll give you
three grand.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Sorry – the car’s been promised for a kid’s
charity.</p>
<p><strong>body shop owner</strong>: Okay, four grand.</p>

by the phone on which Vince is writing. It’s got Beetroot McKinley’s
name and phone number on it. And also one amount: $20,000. On the desk
is a map with Houston circled. Vince has just finished dialing. The
phone is picked up before the first ring is half over.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. houston skyscraper - day 100</strong>: A sign on the
top of the building reads: “McKinley Aerospace.”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Beetroot McKinley talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Uh… Webster – calling from California. I
happen to have some merchandise you might want –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It’s the amount of enrichment I want to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. vince’s apartment - vince 103</strong>: Edgy. His
pencil bounces up and down on the crucial amount, the twenty
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Look, Beetroot – if we can’t renegotiate we
wither and die. I’m not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing
for sure I got twenty for my cut.</p>
<p><strong>104 continued: 104</strong>: McKINLEY</p>
<p><strong>105 int. vince’s apartment - vince - day 105</strong>:
clearing his throat, taken aback by the violence of Beetroot’s tone.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I guess twenty seems a little high to you.
I’m a reasonable guy – I’ll take fifteen – Listen to me, you poor excuse
for a warmed over turd, a deal’s a deal –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – But –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I can do better than five here. If you can do
better than five million dollars, take it!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: F-five million dollars…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Beetroot?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’ll see you in Houston – after all, fair is
fair. I’ll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Five million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Your boss at the lot told me you were on
duty when the Cadillac clocked in. Now what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Okay… His name is Vince Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That’s certainly a beginning.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’m really disappointed in you – ratting on
your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: My best friend who’s been screwing my wife
for three years.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You knew?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: All three years.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: And you never told me until there was a
stranger listening? Shit, what about my reputation?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Where can I find Mister Benedict?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’m not saying.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Let me get this right – You’re protecting
the weasel who’s been screwing your wife for the past three years.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: He’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll have to beat it out of
you –</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Stop – I’ll tell – He lives at 1622 Westridge
Place – He’s got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Thanks for saving me.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I always loved you, Al.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It’s just I couldn’t resist Vince. It’s those

U.S., which he’s studying while singing the song “Houston”:</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: ‘Going back to Houston, Houston,
Houston…’</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vince, the most amazing thing has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You scared the living shit out of me –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I met one of our fathers. He told me of a
man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: She didn’t abandon you – she didn’t even
know you were born!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Awww – that’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: And she was told that I died!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Look, Julius, I’m in kind of a hurry. Sammy
wants me to take the car to Houston. Much bigger bucks when you raffle
for charity in Houston.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – New Mexico is on the way to Houston.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: A lot of places are on the way to Houston.
I’ll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill.
Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven
in New Mexico!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Yes we do! And I’m coming with you!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You know – you’re right. This is fate –
destiny – But there’s no way I’m gonna drive for 1500 miles with you
smelling like that –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You’re right – I’ll take a shower – be right
back –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Why does everybody have to like me so
much?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Happy birthday, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Oh please – It’s not my birthday anymore
–</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Happy birthday, Vince. Is Julius around?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Nowhere –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You were going somewhere – you weren’t even
going to say goodbye –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Okay, okay – look, you can’t tell anybody
this – not even your sister – but I’m onto something so huge it gives me
a rash just thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I got something in here – – I don’t even know
what it is – that’s worth a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: A fortune! That’s great!</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Never sleep with that man. Never loan him
money. And never believe a word he tells you – that’s free advice.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vince…?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m coming with you. I’m not letting you out
of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I am because if you say ‘no’ one more time –
– I’ll tell everybody you’re hiding a fortune in your –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: mouth; he’s beaten and he</p>
<p><strong>111 int. vince’s apartment - day 111</strong>: Marnie snoops
around, examines the group photo lying on top of Julius’s suitcase. In
the b.g. she can hear Julius singing in the shower –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: ‘Put on your red dress, baby, ’cause we’re
going out tonight…’</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Marnie – excuse me – I was just taking a
shower.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I heard you singing – I baked some cookies
for you.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I guess it was a dumb idea.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Not at all – I’m really looking forward to
tasting them. I should put on some clothes – But I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh – don’t mind me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I hope Vince doesn’t mind if I borrow one of
his shirts.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Just don’t try wearing his pants.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: throws open the door, with a big smile on her
face.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Guess what? Vince just invited us all to go
to New Mexico and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: That’s a great idea, Vince.</p>

comes another car. Webster is driving. He spots the address, turns in
and as he does –</p>
<p><strong>115 int. vince’s living room - day 115</strong>: It’s pretty
much a shambles as Webster ransacks the place. Frustrated, he moves out
of the room as we –</p>
<p><strong>closeup - vince’s crumpled piece of paper</strong>: As
Webster unfolds it, reads Beetroot McKinley’s name, phone number, and
the sum “5 million dollars.” Vince’s CAT appears at Webster’s feet,
MEOWING. He reaches down and strokes it.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Open up, Benedict! I know you’re in
there!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Your owner seems to be a very popular
fellow these days.</p>
<p><strong>117 continued: 117</strong>: Morris has his elbow in a sling
and a bandage on his head, courtesy of Julius. They spread out… and then
freeze at the sound of RUNNING WATER from the kitchen tap.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It’s not really important, is it? I wanted
to feed the cat before I left.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: I asked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re the Klane brothers. That’s Burt and
Morris – I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Interesting genetic pool. You’re looking
for Vince Benedict, right?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Am I Vince Benedict?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: So what’s the difference who I am?</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Hit him, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Your brothers seem to have a problem with
their feet. It could be contagious.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Have a good, good day.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. car - night 120</strong>: Linda, in the front seat,
has her head resting on Vince’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>a121 ext. highway - night a121</strong>: The car speeds
by.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Did Julius like the cookies?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I’m not sure… he said they’d provide one
hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source
vitamins in a high-fiber form that’s an integral part of a properly
balanced diet.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I think that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I really hope so.</p>
<p><strong>a123 int. gas station - convenience store - dawn

<p><strong>vince</strong>: Whoa – get away from that window! There’s
women and children out there! What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You allergic to something?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What are those bumps doing all over your
body? You’re all swelled up. You look like you’re about to explode.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We can’t all be born beautiful like you,
Vince. Some of us –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Are just born to be bad. It’s you, Julius.
Oooh, you are so scary…</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Julius…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Let’s rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It’s his first T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: See if you can get us a room with a
king-sized bed, okay?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: That’s not necessary. I always sleep on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>125 ext. los alamos - day 125</strong>: The Caddy drives
through this mysterious town in the mountains of New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Now promise me something.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: If this professor Traven says he’s never
heard of Mom, and us twins, and all our dads, and the experiment, I
don’t want you to be upset. – Because this is entirely possible.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You still think I’m making it all up, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>a127 int. lab building corridor - day a127</strong>: As
TRAVEN, now a tanned, fit 70-year-old, stands framed in his office
doorway, looking coldly out at Vince and Julius. He looks like more of a
prick than ever.</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: I don’t know who you are and I don’t know
what you’re talking about. Now get the hell out of here before I call
security.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well, that’s that. On to Houston.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: He’s lying!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Keep your voice down. This place is crawling
with security –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: For the first time in my life, I am – –
pissed off!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Don’t do this to me. I got a car to deliver.
The last thing I need is a detour in the slammer –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m going to make him tell us the truth…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>127 int. traven’s office - day 127</strong>: Traven looks up
from some papers on his work table as –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: That’s our mother – those are our six
fathers – that’s Werner – and that’s you! Start talking!</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: You turned out just like I thought you
would, Vincent. What did you do, escape from prison?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: … How did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: I named you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Holy shit. It’s all true.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. basement hallway - day 128</strong>: As CAMERA MOVES
SLOWLY DOWN it, we realize this is a reprise of our film’s opening
location.</p>
<p><strong>laboratory door</strong>: Chained and padlocked. Traven
unlocks it, pulls off the chains.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. lab - day 129</strong>: The very same one we saw in
our opening, now covered in dust and cobwebs. Julius and Vince take it
all in; they’re numb, while Traven seems in control again.</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: This room was sealed as soon as your mother
gave birth.</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: You came out first, of course… We weren’t
expecting him.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: gazes at the “blender” we saw Traven
demonstrating in 1953.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This must be where you made the
milkshake…</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: We weren’t making milkshakes. We were making
the most fully- developed human the world has ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had
two of us – way to go, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it
didn’t split equally. All the purity and strength went into Julius. All
the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every
morning.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Whoa – I’m the crap?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: It’s not true, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No, I want to hear this. I’m left-over crap?
I’m no good?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: He’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: Just look at him –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You tellin’ me I’m a side effect!?!</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: You haven’t got the brainpower to understand
this – Vincent, and I haven’t got the time – show’s over.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Tell us where our mother is… dickhead!</p>
<p><strong>traven</strong>: Whispering Pines… it’s an artists colony…
two hundred miles north of Santa Fe.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: If you’re lying to me. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: My life just got flushed down the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You’re wrong, Vincent. Your life’s just
about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m genetic garbage.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent, we’re twins.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I know this is a touchy subject for you,
Julius. But the fact is, we don’t look the same – we don’t act the same,
we don’t talk the same – we don’t dress the same.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: So how come if we’re the same, we’re so damn
different.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We had six fathers, Vince. We’re different
parts of a lot of different people.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: And remember, I was taken to a beautiful
island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to
dream, to create. But you had none of that.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody
to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the
only person you could count on was yourself.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You’re the missing part of my life and I’m
the missing part of your life. And when we find our mother we can fill
the missing part of hers. We won’t be alone anymore, Vince. We can be a
family.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: A family? You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>130 continued: 130</strong>: Julius nods. Vince thinks about
it some more.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas
trees…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: … and a real home where you’ll always be
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Always?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Even when you’ve been bad.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. clothing store - day 132</strong>: As Vince ushers
Julius through the door.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Is this necessary?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m not introducing you to my mother dressed
like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes.</p>
<p><strong>sales clerk</strong>: Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Do I look like I need help? Here’s the
problem. Maybe I’ll try on a couple of things myself.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Do I look okay?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You look better, put it that way. We got to
do something about the way you walk. You’re moving a tad stiff, Jules.
Ever see Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I read the book.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s not gonna help. You got to walk like
you’re moving in time to music. I’m not talking about military marches
now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell
and the Drells and a couple of white guys.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Like this… You just got to try to be cool,
you know? Try these on.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Am I cool now? –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Mr. Ice.</p>
<p><strong>134 ext. park - day 134</strong>: Linda and Marnie look up in
amazement as Vince and Julius bop down the pavement towards them.</p>
<p><strong>marnie/linda</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We know where to find our momma!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Everything Julius said was true. I’m the
product of geniuses!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I always knew that.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Of course, but it’s nice to make it
official.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Tommorrow we’re going to finally meet our
mother.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: And tonight we celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>135 int. vince and julius’s motel room - night 135</strong>:
Vince is finishing dressing, making sure he looks partic- ularly
fantastic. Julius hangs back; something is bothering him.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vince, you’ve got to help me – I’ve never
been out on a date before… what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with
her. Girls like to dance.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Dance?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I guess you haven’t done that before
either.</p>
<p><strong>135 continued: 135</strong>: Julius shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well – forget all that disco shit, everyone’s
seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You dance with them?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It turns them to putty in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He shoves a chair out of the way, making a
little room.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet
–</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – Thank you for this, Vince –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – I said put your feet by my feet not on my
feet! –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’ll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three,
turn… … put your arm here – you’re breaking my fingers – you’re not
wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji – don’t clench your
teeth –</p>
<p><strong>136 int. daddy’s girl - night 136</strong>: Julius and Marnie
in the middle of the large dance floor in a large club – and Julius is
waltzing magnificently.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well, you’ve learned to waltz. Now it’s time
to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced.</p>
<p><strong>a137 int. daddy’s girl - booth a137</strong>: Vince, Linda,
Julius and Marnie are seated at a table covered with quite a few empty
beer bottles. They are all a little drunk.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Did you know they had beer in ancient
Egypt?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Er… no…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Actually it was invented by the Assyrians,
but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation
process.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You sure know a lot about beer.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: He knows a lot about everything.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: But it’s all from books. Until tonight I
never had a beer. All theory, no practice – the story of my life!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Well, we’re going to change all that – aren’t
we, Marnie?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Anything…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Am I shit-faced yet?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You’re getting there.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Please excuse me – my back teeth are
floating.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I better see if mine are, too.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You do that too, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Not all the time. Listen, Marnie’s got the
hots for you. Tonight could be your lucky night…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I don’t think she really likes me.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Piece of cake. You’re nervous ’cause it’s
your first time. Perfectly natural.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Were you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I was twelve and she was a nun – that’s real
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I got to admit it, Jules – since I met you,
life is getting better all the time.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I’m so happy,
I want to pick you up and hug you!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Hey, cut it out! Not in here!</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Go easy on the beer, okay?</p>
<p><strong>beetroot</strong>: Lookin’ forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>beetroot</strong>: Sorry, Webster, looks like I’m doin’
business with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’d do the same thing. You want the
delivery, it’s not your problem who delivers. If you ever need me, my
answering service forwards all messages.</p>
<p><strong>beetroot</strong>: Put this in my personal file. God, I love
a professional…</p>
<p><strong>139 omitted 139</strong>: &amp; &amp; 140 140</p>
<p><strong>141 int. daddy’s girl - booth - night 141</strong>: Linda and
Marnie, both a little tipsy. Linda suddenly freezes at the sight of
Morris Klane scoping the room. Morris is still wearing a bandage from
his beating by Julius.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa
Fe?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Well, I phoned work and told them we

<p><strong>burt and bob klane</strong>: each with a cast on his foot,
each supported by a crutch, force them back into the booth.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Hello, girls – Do you mind if we sit
down and enjoy the music with you?</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: This has gone way past a simple case of
loan deliquency.</p>
<p><strong>bob klane</strong>: We don’t like getting shot.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What are you talking about? We didn’t shoot
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: It’s no way to do business.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: We want to take Vince out to the parking
lot and kill him.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That’s kind of drastic, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Don’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: This is not your problem – you don’t
want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: – Ow!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You moved too soon…</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: The second rule in a crisis situation:</p>
<p><strong>morris klane</strong>: He’s starting that funny talk
again…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: If you choose to bluff, you must be prepared
to have your bluff called.</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: This is no bluff – Asshole –</p>
<p><strong>burt klane</strong>: Meet my cousins. Get these jerks
outside.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: How many of those… rules do you have?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo
swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can
be applied to many other areas of life.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I bet.</p>

<p><strong>143 int. motel room - night 143</strong>: Julius is unpacking
his suitcase on one of the beds – arranging his books on the bedside
table, hanging his clothes on hangars. Vince watches him, glances at his
watch, and begins to edge towards the door.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Uh… we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar,
free ice – we’re in great shape.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I thought I’d just go and tuck Linda in for
the night.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Maybe read her a bedtime story. Don’t wait up
for me.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth
place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight –
We’ve got this great room. It just doesn’t get any better than this.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Oh yes it does.</p>

Stooges” at their moronic best.</p>
<p><strong>143 continued: 143</strong>: He returns his attention to the
book he’s been reading – something the size of a dictionary – but can’t
help returning his gaze to the TV. He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at
the DOOR. Embar- rassed by what he’s been watching, he quickly turns off
the TV, and goes to answer the door, still holding the book.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You forgot your key – I know. Lucky I waited
up.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Hi – Vince and Linda want to be alone, so
I’m afraid I’m going to stay here. Which bed should I take?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Either… I always sleep on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: This mattress is awful.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Sorry. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: This mattress is just as bad as the other
one.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: This is better… Good night.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No, please, take my shirt. I’m baking.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You still cold?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Just my legs.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Well, I could give you my…</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I’d love a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh, great!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Do you mind if I share your blanket? –
Mine’s all wet.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No – that would be okay.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Could we switch sides? I like to sleep on
the left.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Can I ask you something for a change?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Do you like me? I mean, even a little
bit?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I… I’m crazy about you, Marnie. But there’s
something about me you ought to know.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’m a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>143 continued: 143</strong>: Marnie glances heavenward, and
silently mouths the words “thank you.” She smiles down at Julius and
starts very gently kissing him.</p>

sit-ups.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Eighteen – nineteen –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You sick or something?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Julius gave me a few pointers – –
Seventy-five – seventy-six – I don’t need to exercise, but Mom’s gonna
see me for the first time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my
best.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: She’ll love you whatever you look like.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I know she will – I have that effect on
people – – One hundred and forty-three – one forty-four – – I just hope
she’s not too disappointed in Julius – he can’t help how weird he seems
at the start –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I think you’re nervous.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Hey – I sleep great every night – – what if
she’s disappointed in me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Five hundred. Don’t want to overdo.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If she’s disappointed in you, then she’s a
fake – who could want more from a son?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You’re right. I couldn’t do this without you,
Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know. That’s why, when we get back, I think
we should move in together.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Whoa! Move in together?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m not saying we have to get married or
anything, and it’s not about me wanting to keep an eye on you, either. I
just want to live with you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I’m no good at playing house – I’m grouchy in
the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I promise not to try and make you happy
unless you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Why don’t we sleep on this, okay? I mean,
I’ve got a big day tomorrow. It’s gonna be great – taking my best girl
to meet my mom.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Am I really your best girl?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: There’s nobody else, Linda, not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There better not be, because… ‘I only have
eyes for you…’</p>
<p><strong>147 int. julius and marnie’s motel room - night 147</strong>:
They’re both gazing up at the ceiling, bathed in after- glow. Marnie has
obviously just had the sexual experience of her life. Julius is equally
dazed and happy.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Are you sure you’ve never done this
before?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I think I would have remembered…</p>

<p><strong>b148 ext. small indian village - day b148</strong>: The Caddy
pulls up by a roadside flower stand.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let’s get her some flowers.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Good idea. One bunch from me, one from
Jules.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: And one from us –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: It’s very beautiful, isn’t it, Vince?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Not to mention valuable – real estate like
this must be worth a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You mustn’t always think of money.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You got me wrong – I’m just saying it’s nice
Mom’s loaded – that’s a worry she won’t have to have in her old age.</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’d like to see Miss Mary Anne Benedict,
please.</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We’ve come a long way. I can assure you she’s
going to be very happy to see us.</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: I suggest you write a letter to the
Benedict Foundation stating your business.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: A foundation?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You think it’s her? I do.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Gotta be. Well, don’t just stand there.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Introduce yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Should you be here?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: That depends on how you feel personally about
trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Is he always funny like that?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’d like to see Mary Ann Benedict please;
is she here?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: ’Course she’s here – – climbing over the
wall like that, I should call the police –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Please don’t do that – look – this isn’t one
of your average everyday situations – she’s our mother is the thing.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’re her sons.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Twin sons.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: – You’re comedians –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We’re kind of a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: I’ll bet you are – follow me.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: We were right –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – It is her –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We thought that that woman –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: – Is Mary Ann?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: No – This is an artist’s colony; there’s a
lot of painters.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This is some chunk of real estate – Mom owns
it all, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: You can’t really own something like that
view over there, or that sunset, can you?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I can’t wait to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: This way, please.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Mary Anne Benedict never understood why
people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were
considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that
young artists would have a place to work.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She’s not famous anymore?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: She never wanted to be famous. She just
wanted to be left alone.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: May I ask you a question? Why do you keep
referring to her in the past tense?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Because she passed away, some time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>vince and julius</strong>: They look like they’ve been kicked
in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: But – but you said she was here –</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: She is – I meant her spirit. Her spirit is
always here. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>another angle - vince and julius</strong>: They haven’t
moved. Linda and Marnie try to console them. Julius still doesn’t move.
Vince shakes Linda off and stomps away.</p>

kicks them, then hurries toward the Caddy. Julius, still carrying his
bouquet, picks up Vince’s flowers, then places the two bouquets into a
niche in the wall. Marnie joins him and adds her flowers.</p>
<p><strong>a151 continued: a151</strong>: The sound of the Caddy’s HORN
HONKING.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Can we get the hell out of here?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: These real estate developers won’t be
happy until they turn this place into a golf course.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Now they’re climbing over the walls?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: They’re shameless. They’ll try anything.
Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that. It was
really quite disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry…</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: It’s alright… You get over things. I did
have a child once, but he died at birth…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You ought to be so proud of your mother,
Vince. She donated her house and her land and all her paintings to help
young artists.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Do I look like a young artist to you,
Linda?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Vince, all she meant was –</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I know what she meant. And I know why she’s
here, too. It’s got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do
with money.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You know that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Bull-shit.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Take it easy, Vincent. It’s not her
fault.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You hear that, everybody? The creature from
the black lagoon just put in his two bits. I should have my head
examined for listening to you in the first place – deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity and I’m driving around looking for a dead mother.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: All I wanted was to make us into a
family.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Family, my butt. There’s no family here.
There’s just me and three losers – I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>153 continued: 153</strong>: Vince storms off, gets into the
Caddy and squeals away, throwing Julius’s suitcase out the window as he
goes. Linda and Marnie take off after him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vince – quit acting crazy –</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: He dumped us in the middle of New
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’ll be fine. And maybe he’ll be better off
alone.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You don’t know – he’s got something worth
maybe millions in that trunk – he could get himself killed delivering
it.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: He’s been getting out of trouble all his
life, he’s good at it.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: He may need you.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I don’t know much anymore – on the island I
was smart. Here, I’ve only made things worse.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Don’t you realize you could make things a
lot worse if you don’t do something. Julius – you’re still very smart
it’s just you’re not thinking so well right now – on account of what you
found out at Whispering Pines – but you’re not alone, you know – I mean,
you live long enough, everyone’s mother dies…</p>

strides purposefully along, carrying his suitcase. He reaches a

to move. As he does, a CREEP starts walking along with him, eyeing his
suitcase, just like the Biker did when Julius first arrived in
Hollywood.</p>

<p><strong>170 int. warehouse - day 170</strong>: He drives inside a
large warehouse, parks, gets out and looks warily around. He opens the
trunk, unzips the sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>beetroot</strong>: Step away from that car, Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I thought we had a deal here.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: This is what?</p>
<p><strong>beetroot</strong>: You come here alone, unarmed? You’re just
a fool who stole a car, aren’t you? It’s a new, low- cost fuel-injection
system for jet engines – worth a fortune to the company that brings it
to the market first. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Five million dollars –</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: You wanna count it?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>170 continued: 170</strong>: Vince takes the case, gazes at
the money, snaps it shut. He can’t believe he’s pulled it off. Beetroot
and the Bodyguard get into the Cadillac. The Caddy speeds away while
Vince clutches the attache case to his chest and does a little dance of
triumph. The big score at last! TWO SHOTS RING out. Vince freezes and
sees –</p>

pump action shotgun. He opens the Caddy and pushes the dead Bodyguard
off the horn. Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well.</p>

<p><strong>webster</strong>: All I want is the money, Benedict. Just
give me what’s mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing
your best friend’s wife.</p>

he pours his fire at the window Vince broke – large chunks of the
BUILDING EXPLODE off wherever Webster fires.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Pack it in, Vince, you’re only wasting time
– I don’t give a damn about you, just the money –</p>

<p><strong>c173 ext. warehouse - day c173</strong>: As Vince puts
distance between himself and the warehouse. Suddenly he stops, as if
he’s heard or “felt” something. He shakes the feeling off, resumes
running… and then stops again, shuts his eyes tightly, trying to deny
what’s happening to him.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: No way… this is bullshit… Julius, you

<p><strong>d173 int. warehouse - day d173</strong>: as Julius gracefully
shinnies down a cable, lands near Webster. He tosses the suitcase to the
ground, backs away. Webster approaches. Julius’ hands, as before, are

<p><strong>julius</strong>: Vincent’s twin brother – we’re in this

never carry guns.</p>

<p><strong>vince</strong>: I am never going to forgive you for this.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You were going to get killed. I tried to
distract him so you could escape.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I had escaped. I was on my way to Brazil –
when I felt you.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: So, why didn’t you go?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Because, thanks to you, I’m now not only a
godamn psychic, I’ve got this disease called a conscience!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Nobody ever said being good was easy.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: How am I going to survive out there? What are
my friends going to think?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You haven’t got any friends.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Just what are you two talking about?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we’re
squabbling, it’s personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of
luxury somewhere. Try Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I doesn’t work like that, you might talk to
people – Who wants it first.</p>

Webster’s weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching
his hand, dancing around.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You can be an irritating pain – but sometimes
you come in handy. – Where’d you get the gun?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: From the dead man in the car.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You should have checked if he had a gun,
chump.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: He said he didn’t believe in them.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Ooooh – you lied?</p>

<p><strong>vince</strong>: Looks like you messed with the wrong people,
wise guy.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: But your luck just ran out.</p>

<p><strong>vince</strong>: We’re a rich family, right?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We’re a good family. I’m sorry, Vince, but

<p><strong>vince</strong>: Return the money?!? Are you nuts?!? This is
dirty money, Julius – it doesn’t belong to anybody –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: – Including us – think how much better

<p><strong>linda</strong>: Typical.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: All I ask is for another chance. I know I
probably don’t deserve it, but –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re right, you don’t deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I had to break into your apartment, but –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Vince, they’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: So, do you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: But?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You mean, that matter we talked about once
and never really resolved.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What matter is that?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: The matter of you and me living together.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Your place or mine?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What do we do? Most people on this planet
cause problems – the Benedict Corporation solves them. We’re a
consulting firm – a think-tank – sort of like the Rand Corporation –
only smarter! Tuesday at three. See you then.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Look at this, Vince – proposals from the Red
Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization – we should only have
clients who do humanitarian work.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Just as long as they pay – we’re not running
a charity, you know.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>vince and julius</strong>: Confused, just look at her for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>mary anne</strong>: It’s so incredible I’m not even sure
which one of you is which.</p>
<p><strong>mary anne</strong>: You see, I didn’t believe you, I mean who
would believe a story like your story – crazy – They lied to me all
these years… And they lied to you… But you found one another … And you
found me… Please – God – one of you say something.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Momma?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Mamma?</p>
<p><strong>momma!</strong>: They both run to Mary Anne and hug her for
all she’s worth. They’re laughing, crying, holding each other. Slowly,
we…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Watching them. Now there are tears on his
face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them
both up in to the air, cradling them. They’re laughing. They’re crying.
They’re holding each other.</p>
<p><strong>178 omitted 178</strong>: thru thru 180 180</p>
<p><strong>181 close on werner 181</strong>: Smiling happily. PULL BACK
to reveal we are –</p>
<p><strong>ext. griffith park - day</strong>: In front of the
merry-go-round. Werner purchases a hand- ful of tickets from the vendor,
hands one each to Mary Anne, Linda and Marnie.</p>
<p><strong>mary anne</strong>: I just can’t get over how alike they
are…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: They kepp you up all night again, too?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Sceaming in stereo.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I think you need your diaper changed. What a
surprise – so do you.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Not you, too – It’s not a competition, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Just think what we’d be like if we’d been
raised together.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Now that’s a scary thought.</p>
<p><strong>182 ext. griffith park merry-go-round - later 182</strong>:
Vince and Julius are sitting on adjoining horses. Linda and Marnie hand
their sons up to them, watched proudly by Mary Anne. The merry-go-round
starts moving, and the last image we see is of Vince and Julius on the
horses, holding their twin sons. As they move PAST US, END CREDITS BEGIN
