<h1 id="the-wedding-date">the-wedding-date</h1>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m so sorry. I wasn�t quite ready for you.</p>
<p><strong>bike messenger</strong>: Lady, you said this was a rush. I
can�t rush anything anywhere if you don�t give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It�s a plane ticket.</p>
<p><strong>bike messenger</strong>: So it is.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: For a date. For my date. To my sister�s
wedding. In London. He�s never met my family.</p>
<p><strong>bike messenger</strong>: I hear that noise.</p>
<p><strong>bike messenger</strong>: You need to let go.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah. You�re going to have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m off duty. I do not exist. Don�t even look
at me.</p>
<p><strong>harried employee</strong>: I�ve got a tour group from Taipei
trapped in customs, a dead poodle in Cargo parked at T9, and a lost
grandmother staggering around International asking for her mommy. Oh,
and there�s a guy on two who was stuck with his in-laws for a week
because we couldn�t get him out of Dulles. The in-laws aren�t speaking
to him anymore and, for some reason, he�s pissed.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I would love to help you. Sincerely. But my
sister�s getting married this weekend, I haven�t seen my family in two
years, and my flight leaves in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You take Taipei. Tammy�s schnauzer just had
puppies. Put her on the dead dog. Park reps with wheelchairs at every
john in T8. If Grandma just got off a trans-con, she�s gotta go
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>harried employee</strong>: What about line two?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I completely understand, sir. You just want
your in-laws to see you the way you see yourself. Or at least the way
you would see yourself if you didn�t feel so victimized by them.</p>
<p><strong>clipboard</strong>: Hello? Calls may be monitored for quality
control?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>clipboard</strong>: Over-share!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Mr. Rajagopal, we regret that you were snowed
in at Dulles but snowstorms fall under a category called force majeure.
Along with earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. In short, we�re not
liable.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But just this once, I�m going to refund the
full price of your ticket and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.
Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic!</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Your first trip?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hardly. My family moved to England when I was
fourteen. My stepdad�s a professor at University College, London. I�m
going back for my sister�s wedding…and the best man�s my ex. In case I
chicken out, I want to know where all the exits are.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I don�t believe in marriage. I believe
in hot sex. Of course, that draws men to me like flies to shit.</p>
<p><strong>hot guy</strong>: Hello, my sweet darling.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m not a knuckler. I fly all the time. In
fact, I transferred from Heathrow two years ago and now I run Bags and
Nags here at Kennedy, so things are going really well for me. The reason
I can�t feel my legs is that any minute, my date is going to walk in
that door. And I need him to look really, really good today.</p>
<p><strong>male flight attendant</strong>: I wish I couldn�t feel my
legs.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, no. He�s here.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What do you think? Does he look hot, and is it
the kinda hot that�ll translate overseas?</p>
<p><strong>male flight attendant</strong>: I resent your stereotyping of
a man in my profession but…</p>
<p><strong>male flight attendant</strong>: …darling, he�d be hot on
Mars. I�d like to unwrap him like a Harrod�s gift basket.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hi. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Kat.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let�s sit.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m glad you found it okay. The airport. The
plane, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I really am sorry I couldn�t leave earlier. I
know you would have loved a few hours to settle in before the party.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Work must be crazy right now.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�ve gotta warn you, you know those families
where everyone�s out of their minds but at the end of the day, they�re
family, so you love them? Mine�s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I love my dad. But since he�s my stepdad, he�s
technically not family. He�s more like a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My seat belt, it�s….</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Please tell me you�re not wearing that
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It�s no big deal. Really. It just looks like a
tailor cut off a yard of my dress and made your tie out of it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don�t get me wrong, matching�s fine. It�s
�matchy matchy� you�ve got to watch out for. This is matchy-matchy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think we look like we�re trying too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not
like we�re trying too hard to look like we fit. It�s welcome cocktails,
not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach
schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�ll teach you a trick. If you look people in
the eye, they�ll never even notice what you have on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What color are my shoes?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You have feet?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I understand how important this is to you, but
you�re a beautiful woman and you�ve got everything in the world going
for you. I couldn�t care less what you have on.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don�t patronize me. They�ve clearly been at
this a while.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re funny.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel
like crap, it�s way better to look hot while you�re doing it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Really? Don�t get too attached.</p>
<p><strong>zitty teenager</strong>: I liked the red one better.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�ll let her know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I bet you�re doing that girl thing, where you
get undressed without showing any skin.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, I�m not. How�d he know?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm– Gorgeous, I was insane
to let you go!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>zitty teenager</strong>: I�d do you. I mean, if it was all
right with you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know, they say you can tell everything you
need to know about a person from the way they act when they�re
naked.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I don�t do naked. My sister? She does
naked.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You okay, hon?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m not sure I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re never going to be sure of anything, but
we still have to go inside.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: �Baby love, my baby love.�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Please, Mom. This is not the time to be
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: And who might this be?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m the new guy. It�s great to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: This is a marathon, not a sprint. After
welcome cocktails, you�ve got the hen party. Tomorrow, there�s a picnic
and the rehearsal dinner and since you�ve conveniently left no margin
for jet lag– I need you to hydrate, baby.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Hi, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Meet Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I�m getting MARRIED!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I find a good, strong drink helps.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can I get you a refill, sir?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a
water-back.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Is there any other way to take it?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Where�d you find this guy?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The Yellow Pages.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Welcome, friends and family!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an amp?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Victor and I would especially like to thank
our out-of-town guests for coming to celebrate with us as we welcome
Edward and the Fletcher- Wootens into our family.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: It�s funny. We always thought we�d marry off
Kat first. We came close once, but that crashed and burned.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Still, we had reason to hope. She was always
one of the more �active� girls at the American school, and that�s saying
a lot.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Okay, okay. I get the hint! Anyway, imagine
our surprise when Ed moved in next door and fell in love with…the girl
next door. Our Amy. Lucky for us, he had no idea it was an unforgiveable
clich�. A toast to the bride and groom to be. Congratulations,
babies!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thanks for, you know, with the piano…. It was
really…. Hm. I have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why, Jeffrey. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hello, Katmandu.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You look well, Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Seeing you again….</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from
each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You
haven�t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have
gynecologists that call more often.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You have more than one gynecologist?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Sure. You�ve got to play them against each
other. Otherwise they think you�re easy.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Hey, asshole, since you dumped my cousin
brutally and without cause, you won�t mind if I steal her away?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You didn�t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I wasn�t saving you from him. I was saving you
from yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don�t worry. I�m so over him. By the way, do
you know if he�s seeing anyone?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Why waste ten more seconds on the slimy limey
when Mr. Tie-Me-Up-Tie-Me-</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: After Kat�s father died and I married Victor,
I was so desperate for my little girl to love him. It never occurred to
me that she might love him more.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: What�s he do anyway?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Therapist.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I think I just came.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can I have that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You know what I love about all this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: There�s finally a reason for the whole world to
revolve around you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Exactly! Today�s my day. Tomorrow will be my
day. And the day after that? My day.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How�s the future Mrs.?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Perfect. All ginny.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Except it�s Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But I�m not taking your name, buster. I�m a
feminist! I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All right, then kiss me. God, I�m a lucky
sod.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See what happens when you put off dance lessons
til two days before the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who�s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding,
honestly?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Um, just about everyone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You are taking the piss?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We�ll go with you guys tomorrow. I suck too.
It�ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don�t even know you, hunky-dunky, and I love
you already.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dance lessons. Right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Oh, hello.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A wedding is a sacrament…a joyous celebration
of love and commitment.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Ah, a philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shrink, actually.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Crikey.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Nothing, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You Yanks and your therapy. It�s great.
It�s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It�s just, there�s this girl I care for –
God, I suppose I could even say I love her – and the bugger is, of
course, she�s here with someone else. Bollocks!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hey, Kat.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey, yourself. I see you�ve met my ex.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Did I interrupt something?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was just telling Jeffrey how we met.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot
dog?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in
�share.� People do that.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You hate sports.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not when Nick explains them.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Right. I should be going. Good to meet you.
Perhaps I�ll see you at the stag party. My place. You know the
address.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Love.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram�.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He was pretty drunk, but I think he�s still
crazy about you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Of course he is. I�m here with my new man. I
love it! Your magic�s already working. Let the suffering begin.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The only one suffering here is you. You need
to stop worrying about everyone else. You think you can do that?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What did he say exactly? I mean, you don�t
think he wants me back?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don�t know.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What does your gut say?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re too good for him.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Well, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks again for having me.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Don�t be silly. It�s wonderful to finally
meet you. Although, technically, I had no idea you existed because when
my daughter turned twelve, she stopped talking to me, except when she
needed money. So let me rephrase that.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Okay, Bun. That�s enough.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Where�s Nick sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Why, with you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My mother has a rule about men and women
sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks
it�s–</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I�m not as square as my daughter thinks.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: She must have drowned her rules in the
Chardonnay.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sorry about the creepy room. I went through a
painfully earnest Laura-Ashley phase.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Count it. Six thousand even.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, count it, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m compulsive and weird?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Six thousand, right?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: On the nose. I tell you what, because you�re
so cute, I�ll take care of our incidentals.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How does it feel to get that much money just
for being you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Great, with the occasional stabs of shame.
Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want
to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That won�t be an issue, believe me. I find the
idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s okay. Hell, I�ve never paid for it. But
please don�t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You quitting?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m desperate to start but I don�t have an
addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can�t get enough
of.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Air Supply?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My parents had a German exchange student a few
years back…. He must have left it here.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Everyone knows their greatest hits but some of
their lesser-known ballads are surprisingly poignant.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s cute.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You stand on your tiptoes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is it an old habit from ballet class or a
childhood spent walking on eggshells?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I never took ballet.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Have you ever done anything like this
before?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A weekend?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: A wedding.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. Though strangely, I�ve done quite a few
funerals.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not the way you�re thinking. The women wanted
me there for support. You can understand that.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I think that�s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not you. You�re not disgusting. You�re lovely.
Just the idea that they�d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um,
didn�t…who never…. I mean, someone�s dead.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That�s right. Imagine facing it alone.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sorry. I�m a little nervous. I never thought
something like this would happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the
phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my
401K.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you know that was me?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I have a friend at the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your �friend� guaranteed my anonymity.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: If it makes you feel any better, to get your
number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case
of mini-Baileys.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can look. It�s part of the package.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Would you grab my shampoo?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Shampoo, got it!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: The part where you were a sexual surrogate and
then started to, um, freelance. Is that really how it happened?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The real story is that my mother was a hippie.
And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash
her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way
to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn�t be
violated.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m just screwing with you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You shit!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have a different story for every woman who
asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay
about being with me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And you thought I�d respond to the hippie
stripper with no boundaries?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately
moved.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This part here. You say, and I quote. �Each
woman has the exact love life she wants.� That seems like a pretty broad
generalization.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So…what was I…oh, yeah. Do you honestly think
that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with
some asshole who led me on for years then – out of the blue – shattered
my heart.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: First of all, it�s never out of the blue. And
second of all–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When you�re ready to let go, to be unsingle
and unmiserable, you will. Until then….</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Is it always women?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you asking me if I�m gay for pay?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Mom�s refining her strategy for DDay.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I�m sure General Eisenhower never had to
master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and
tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the
Fletcher-Wootens.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sir, yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Make sure you show Nick Regents Park. It�s
romantic at night.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Better him on the wrong side of the road
than you behind the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So, um. What about testing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There�s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get
your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you
sleep with them?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My sixth-grade science project was entitled,
�Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.� Trust me, I�m
careful.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I love that you�re asking questions, but do
you really want to get into all of this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes
me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don�t stop asking questions, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Do you pay taxes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I swear. I don�t have a signature move.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, come on. You�re like the Yoda of
escorts.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don�t have gimmicks or play games. It�s way
more…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Subtle?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I disappear. It�s not about me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is
it? I think it�s the words: �morally repugnant.�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m not going to kiss you. You can relax.
You�re safe.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m not going to kiss you. Trust me. All you
have to do is listen to my voice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He�s going to be so sorry he let you go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He�ll look at you with your sexy dress and
your perfect date but it won�t matter because it�s not about him. It�s
about you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I want you to let go of the hurt. …the
insecurity…the past. When you do, he�ll see you the way I see you, and,
in that moment, he�ll finally understand what he lost.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But by then, the amazing thing is…you won�t
care.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Holy crap. You�re worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You better get going.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay, Yoda.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yo, ladies! Listen up! The bride has made the
foolhardy and perhaps fatal request, that we play Pub Golf tonight.
Behold hole one. There�s a twostroke penalty for failure to finish a
hole and a three-stroke penalty for barfing. Yell �Fore!� before you
barf and it�s only two strokes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: We�ve got eight more holes waiting at eight
more bars, so in the name of all things sacred, pace yourselves! To
Amy!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: To me!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought you might need this.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Silly me, where was my head?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Stay. Have a fiery drink with us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don�t know….</p>
<p><strong>smitten girl</strong>: Stay.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: It�s like the director�s cut of �9 1/2
Weeks.�</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: The thing about Nick is, you�re either looking
at him, or you�re pretending not to. Me? I�m looking. Can you believe
Kat gets to sleep with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Honestly, you should send God a bottle of wine
or a muffin basket.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why is he still here?!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, sorry. You�re right. Girls only.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ladies, thank you for granting me this rare
glimpse into a timeless female ritual. To the husbands who won you, the
losers who lost you, and to the lucky bastards who have yet to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And to the cock in the hen house.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I can�t believe you met him first. It�s so
depressing. Somebody buy my wooha a drink.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: To TJ�s lady business. And to Amy!</p>
<p><strong>guys</strong>: To Ed!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What�s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: There�s something about him that�s just a
bit odd.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Other than, he�s shagging your exgirlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: No, that�s not it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You are a tosser.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Remember when we went hiking in the lake
district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It was before you started going out. We had
lunch at that inn on the lake.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: And Kat was fully clothed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But, somehow, it was Kat�s arse that was stung
by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That�s when I realized I wanted to be a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, shut up. You�re an optician.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Lasik surgeon, actually.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I didn�t deserve her back then.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And you do now?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Maybe I hate women.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All women or just the two-legged ones who
steal your money, screw your friends, and vacuum during the World
Cup?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jeff was just reminiscing about your
girlfriend�s backside.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Look, the thing is. About that
love-of-my-life nonsense. I would appreciate it if you didn�t say
anything to Kat. It was silly. It�s all rather complicated.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: This one�s on the house.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m worried. Amy�s not good at drinking. She
gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more
drunker? Is it �drunker� or �drunker-er�?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Just drunk enough.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: If you switch now, you might be able to stand
up for the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Woody?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: �Not yet…�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: �…but it�s getting there. �</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or
was it Nepal?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the
rain.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You look so much better.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Is this what you�re doing? Bartending? Not that
it�s not great. It�s just, you used to have dreams and plans.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Whoa! Good for you!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I always wondered what happened with us.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I haven�t thought about that in years.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your
funky breath?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara
by the bed?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: She�s drunk. -er than me. But I didn�t really
dump you, did I?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Hard.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Which was understandable – you were one of
the hottest girls at the American School, but I sort of thought you�d be
nicer…at least tell me why…�cause we were friends first.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And we know Kat was the hottest expat in school
because she was voted Best Eyes, Brightest Smile, and Most Likely to Age
Well. No, wait. That was me. Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Christ, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, shut up and be happy. It�s always this or
that. You�re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Drunk isn�t the same thing as happy, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You�re my half sister, but I whole love
you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Why don�t you get my half sister her seventh
hole?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Bacardi 151.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don�t think I can go through with this.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Pub Golf?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The wedding. I am so, so bad! I don�t think I
should be allowed to get married.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: TJ! Virginia Slim!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re okay. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Just because some slag�s been paid for, doesn�t
mean you�ve got to…you know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s been my experience that the people who
hire a prostitute, need a prostitute. You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I think I love you, mate. How do you know so
much about so much?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Can you pull over at the next seven ATMs?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: That was awesome! How much do we rock? Fore!</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I WIN!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It was a great party. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Do you want to come in for a minute? We could
talk about–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: When I freaked out at the pub? That was
nothing, just nerves. Don�t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But I do. I will. You�re my sister.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: God, Kat! Please. Don�t be nice to me. I can
take anything right now but you being nice to me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What? Why? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I should get going.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Are you sure you�re okay?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I�m fine. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: She still thinks we don�t know about the boat
thing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wasn�t sure what works for you, so I�ve got
a pack of Saltines, a bottle of Pedialyte – preferred by infants and
rock stars – an eggand- cheese sandwich, a black coffee, and a Bloody
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This is really sweet of you, but I need to ask
you something. What happened last night?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed
out.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Whether it�s true or not, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What�s this?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh. Shoot. I–</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is this for last night?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Of course not. How…how could it be? Nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If I was going to charge you, I would have
told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I didn�t want you to think I was expecting
anything to be free or that I was expecting something at all. Well,
clearly I was expecting something or I wouldn�t have stopped at all
those ATMs on the way home. By the way, would it have been enough? I
mean, if something had happened. Which it didn�t?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don�t they have a limit at those machines?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not if you take an advance on your credit
card.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re three hundred short.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And my Brazilian wax looks like… Brazil.
Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What�s a four letter word for daughter
defiler? Oh. N-I-C-K.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You a boating man, son?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: At least somebody�s using the damn thing. I
was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much,
we never launched her again.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That�s not true. We checked for leaks a few
years back. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ahoy!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So you�re telling me. If something had happened
last night…it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That�s a down
payment on a Ford Focus!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not dollars. Pounds.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My rate isn�t arbitrary. It was determined by
prevailing market conditions. By the way, it includes oral. That�s the
extra three hundred…. Pounds.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And what if I didn�t want you to…to do that to
me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it
to me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Believe me, if anything had happened, that
would have been one of the highlights. For you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But nothing did.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yup. That�s why you get to keep your
money.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hey, Ginger! Hey, Gilligan! How much do I love
all this? I�m going to get divorced and remarried over and over again so
it�ll last forever. Kat, be a sweetie, and go help with the rings. No
way Jeffrey�s going to get it right.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�d be happy to. You�re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Oh, don�t be that way.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Come on, Bun. Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: It�s not always about you, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How could you say that? Of course it�s not
about me. It�s never about me when she�s in the room because you two are
on a special team. You might as well have Tshirts made up.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m sorry. I don�t know why I�m being so
sensitive. I just get tired of being odd man out.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Oh honey, it�s not that I love Amy more. It�s
that she lets me love her.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I�m off. Ta-ta!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay, then. I�ll catch up with you at the dance
thing…. Sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey, Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I heard you were back in town, kitty cat.
You�re here for the highland flings, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I get all the glamour jobs.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thanks, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: The one I made for you is the cherries. You
hang onto it or give it back?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Give it back? Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You pawned it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And
only rarely.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You want I nut him in the boat?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the
tourists.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You want me to let him in?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Of course, don�t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Let me guess. Amy presumed I�d forget the
rings. I think I�m her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Maybe not her least… There�s always–</p>
<p><strong>kat/jeffrey</strong>: Ed�s mother.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So, tell me, how�s unmarried life?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I have regrets.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we�re the
past. I�m not sure if you noticed, but I�m here with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Kat, we must talk. This guy, there�s
something not quite right.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It�s called character. God, you�re
predictable.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Is that why you brought him? Because of
me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don�t be absurd.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I brought him here because he�s my boyfriend.
Because I adore him. Because late at night he takes me in his arms
and….</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�d stick around and explain what that means,
but even if I give you the instruction manual, it doesn�t mean you�ve
got the tools to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Kat, wait. I don�t want you hating me.
We�ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Um, news flash: I don�t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Kat, stop it. You do. You can�t even look
me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: That was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It was. And it took your sister getting
married to get you back here.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So, what�s your point?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I should have told you why I broke up with
you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Sorry, can you give us a moment?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, I can�t. We�re late for a dance lesson. I
guess you�ll have to finish up later.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It�s
all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do.
You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you�re not
walking away!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, cut the crap!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I just hate seeing you so stuck.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help
me get closure.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure
wasn�t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: The wedding dance is, sans doubte, the most
important dance-moment in a person�s life.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: A room full of friends, family,
enemies…watching, smiling, betting on how long the marriage will last.
All you�ll have is each other and whatever skills you acquire today.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: There are people who will tell you that the
wedding dance is symbolic of a couple�s compatibility. Of a rapport that
cannot be faked. That an unskilled man on the dance floor is a man who
lacks grace in bed. These people are right.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: Eyes open and pair off!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m sorry I was such a bitch. I really
appreciate your doing this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s my job.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: She knows you better than anyone. You know
her better than she knows herself. Where does that feeling live? I don’t
care if it’s your heart, your head, or your crotch. Find that place and
dance from it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You know what pisses me off? I�ve been spilling
my guts all weekend but I don�t know anything about you. Not one
thing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m allergic to fabric softener, I majored in
Comparative Literature at Brown, and I think I�d miss you even if we had
never met.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Now will you tell me how you became an
escort?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So you can�t dance, eh? Bloody liar.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I thought you said you were crap.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I had to say something to get you here.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fair enough, but I�m stepping on toes here and
you�re waltzing around like…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Fred Astaire and what�s her face!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It�s not me. I swear. It�s her. She�s
magic.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: And, switch partners!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You�d better get going. My parents will be
�round to cart you off to the country.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Whatever you do, don�t mention Italy. Or
politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Your probably best off pretending you�re
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Pigeons creep me out. They�re like dirty
doves…plotting something.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: How do you have real relationships? You know,
ones you don�t get paid for?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You have had girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure, but it�s never easy. They say they�re
okay with it, and they are…for a while. Then one day, they�re not.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When I said I�d never done a wedding before, I
didn�t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So, why�d you say yes to me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There was something in your voice on the phone
that day.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Desperation?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think it was hope.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What would you do if you weren’t an escort?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Make out with you for free.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What would you do if you stopped worrying
about what other people think?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Spontaneously combust?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: You know, I might just call you… but if I did…I
would lose… because my hand blows.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Let�s see what kind of a man my daughter�s
found for herself.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Raise you thirty.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Can I see it? Just for a sec?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Come on, it�s so not fair. At least describe it
to me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I�m sorry, Nick’s about to win a pile of my
money. He’s gonna have to call you back.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Thank you for your understanding, ma�am. And
good luck putting out that fire.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What is it you do again?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What would you say if I told you I was a
member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation�s most
precious resource: your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh, yeah, shrink. Call.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Let me save you some trouble. My old man hit
the bottle like it was his job and he had a mean streak as wide as the
English Channel. So, me? I drink in moderation and have never raised my
voice around a kid.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What do you say to that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I say that feeling compelled to do the
opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That�s my girl!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Best thing about being a dad is when your
kid starts kicking your ass–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –and The ass of The man who adores her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Anybody seen my future-wife? She�ll kill me if I
don�t serve her first.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Have you guys ever had a real, honest-to-God
fight?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I hear that make-up sex is the best kind.
Unfortunately, I�ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up
the bride and tell her to join the party?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I said no! I�m getting married tomorrow! What
do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Right, then. I�ll get you a Tofurky Burger
instead.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To make sure you�re okay.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You know all that �if these walls could talk�
stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Actually, I do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This place has been in Ed�s family forever. We
used to spend weekends out here every summer. God, I hope it doesn�t
remember everything.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: May I have a word? It�ll be just a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Let me think. You stole seven years of her
life with your charm and your bullshit and now you want a couple more
minutes? Sure. Go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thanks for the solidarity, but next time? A
little less information.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Does Kat know?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It was such a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Still–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: If Ed ever found out….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Or Kat….</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a
Lemondrop every time I see her.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You were so good to me. I swear I never
meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which
I do.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Right. Seven. Christ, that�s a long time,
isn�t it?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not for a dog.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well, we had a lot of good years, but
then…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Is this supposed to be an apology?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It�s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It�s
just my rather feeble attempt to…. Oh, I don�t know. You see, I thought
I could deny my feelings–</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You�re not even listening.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: When we were together I was �too here,� now I�m
not here enough.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. You?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Let�s go.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You, with the hair and all the bright ideas.
Paper lantern plus open flame equals no-no.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That woman is insane. God damn if I don�t
love her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Kat does this thing. She stands on her tiptoes
when she�s looking in the mirror. You ever notice that?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I remember the day I met Kat. It was in New
York. I�d been dating Bunny for a few months, and she finally trusted me
enough to introduce me to her kid. So I�m over at her place and in walks
this little monster that won�t stop talking. She hands me a
walkie-talkie made out of an orange juice can and drags me over to her
fort. The fort was this lop-sided mess of blankets and the walkie-talkie
almost took my ear off, but she was having the time of her life. That
was it. I was a goner.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That was the day I became a dad. And from
that moment on, I just knew. I�d give that little girl everything she
ever needed, I�d love her unconditionally, and I wouldn�t let her out of
the house until she was thirty.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You think it�s going to get easier when they
get older. That you�re going to worry about them less. Or trust the
world more. But that�s just not how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�m not sure if this is going to make sense to
you, Sir, but I�d like to ask permission to date your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The ladies are fond of you, Nick. I can see
that. I also see that whatever else you are, you�re a helluva good guy.
She paid a real price dating Jeffrey. This will be different, won�t
it?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I blame Tony Pee-Pants!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Oh, no. She tells this story at every major
holiday.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Why should this be any different? Besides, I
have to initiate Nick into the family.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Oh, don�t deny it. You barely tolerate each
other.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: It�s true. All you have in common is that you
both secretly want to be me. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for
everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the
internet.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: It was just after we moved here. My little
girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven�t made up
since.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: We were eating and puking together in harmony
until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first
boyfriend. I was fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He
wanted to play with me.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You practically bribed him with your erector
set.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fourteen and he�s hoodwinked by a an erector
set?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I didn�t say he was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Whatever. The point is, Tony ended up with a
chair in his face.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: It was plastic. And child-sized. But there
were some stitches involved.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Like fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Dad made me go over and apologize the next
day.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I�m an American and in America, people sue.
So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don�t bake.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants
opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You should have seen his face– Then, boom.
Right in the kisser.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: What happened to my little angels?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And that�s when he peed in his pants? After
the tart?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He bled a bunch, but no, there was no
peeing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So what�s with the nickname?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Okay, let�s do this. What�s the big
confession?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well, in a way, you were right. The prob
was, you were in love. I wanted to be. But I wasn�t.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: If I�d have confessed, you would have
forgiven me. But the truth is, I didn�t want to be forgiven. I sort of
just needed it to end.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Bollocks, I�m sorry. I had no idea this
would be so difficult.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It�s no
big deal. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Well, it was a big deal. As late as…yesterday.
Or this morning. But not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And you were right – it is why I brought Nick
with me…because I wanted to drive you insane. To torture you slowly, for
the entire weekend. But then something happened. I started to fall for
him. And now, and I hope this doesn�t hurt your feelings, now I�m sick
of you and me, of our story.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It�s the past. It�s nothing but ghosts. So just
get it off your chest, then let�s go back upstairs and eat some
tiramisu.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I slept with your sister.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That�s why I
ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits
until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally
wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Last Christmas when Ed proposed, I
realized…I�m in love with her. I can�t lose her.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: What? Good lord, say something.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I wasted two years grieving this?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Oh, no. He told you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You knew?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I�m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please don�t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I can�t believe you told her!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You said your job was discretion. You couldn�t
wait until you got back to New York?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What�s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Doesn�t look like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Now is not the time to catch on. It is,
however, time for another round.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Kat!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on! Don�t be–</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?! I can�t believe I trusted you! How could
you not tell me!?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus, Kat. What did you want me to say? That
your sister slept with your fianc�? That everybody knew and no one
respected you enough to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Besides, you hired me for my discretion.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You�ve always got that to hide behind, don�t
you? It�s just business!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning,
we�ll go back to the real world and…and you�ll be hiring me for your
best friend!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I mean, come on. Did you actually think we�d
be boyfriend and girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to
me! I don�t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do.
It�s your job. It�s who you are. How would you even know if something
were real?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You�re judging me?! Oh, that�s a good one.
You�re lying to me, you�re lying to your family, and you�re lying to
yourself. But you�re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The
man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You�re right. I was so desperate to make
everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after
all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out
of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you�ll be able to hold
onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�ll just check into a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don�t be ridiculous. It�s late and the place is
empty. Just take my car.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don�t know what�s going on with you two, but
I�m sure it�ll work out. You couldn�t be more perfect for her if she
picked you out of a catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I just wanted to say thank you. For not outing
me in front of Ed. I want to tell him. Just not on the night before our
wedding. With these kind of things, timing is everything.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You�re right. You should really time it right
so when he hears that you repeatedly screwed his best friend, he doesn�t
feel like the world is collapsing around him and there�s no escape
because you tricked him into marrying you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You know what? I�m not having this conversation
right now.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Sure, disappear. We�ve been walking away our
whole lives.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m not even going to discuss the fact that you
screwed my fianc� because you�ve always been a spoiled, amoral, little
princess.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: But I put up with all of it because I really
believed that deep down, you loved me and you were a good person. I
really thought you deserved someone like Ed. God I envied you guys.
Somehow, he made your selfish bullshit seem okay. Almost endearing.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: And now I know. You didn�t deserve any of it.
You were just lucky.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Don�t worry, Amy. Your wedding will be perfect.
Tomorrow, I�ll smile and say all the right things and you�ll deal with
Ed when you�re ready. But right now, tonight, I can�t pretend it�s
okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And that�s the first flight out?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All right, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�m okay.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I don�t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, I�m fine, really. Nothing a bottle of Jack
and a straight razor can�t fix.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Anyway, it doesn�t matter. Today�s Amy�s
day.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: What�s going on with you two?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I was pretty hard on her last night. And now
she�s getting married.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: There�s a reason I always tell that Tony
Pee-Pants story, you know.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Trust me. This is bigger than Tony
Pee-Pants.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Before Tony, you and your sister were best
friends. I couldn�t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you
ate the spinach. If you threw up–.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Mom, please.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the
first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasn�t just
jealous…she was sad and lonely. She missed you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and
sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I wish I had known it would go by so
fast.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Wow. You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever.
Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love
you, you�re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the
main reason I picked you is because you�ve been so miserable for the
past few years, I knew you wouldn�t outshine me. But here it is, my big
day. My big day. And something doesn�t feel right. Maybe it was that pep
talk you gave me last night, I don�t know, but your misery just isn�t
working for me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It was a horrible thing I did to you. I�m
really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know you hate when I get what I want. But
right now, all I want is for you to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So why�d you let him go?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It�s complicated, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh, well, then. It probably won�t work
out.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I read a fascinating article in the New
Yorker once and this guy said: �Every woman has the exact love life she
wants.� You know what? I agree. And I refuse to believe that this is
what you want.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ever since you were a little kid, you�ve
been trying to please other people. And in return for your services, all
they�ve done is disappoint you. So tell me, is this the guy for you?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Then for once in your life, do something for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Your mother said you�d like a quick word.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I was too scared to tell you. I thought you�d
never speak to me again. I�m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Say something. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I knew you were still seeing someone else when
we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it
was Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Does Kat know?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeffrey told her last night.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Last night?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That worthless bastard!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I look like a total wanker, don�t I?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Only way to beat that guy is to take yourself
out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You heading to the train station?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I figured you could pick up your car
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I felt sorry for you last night. I was sitting
there like some smug arse thinking how lucky I am.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I forgave her when I thought it was just some
bloke. Bugger it. Why Jeffrey? I�ve had her up on a pedestal ever
since…since the day I put her up there. It�s going to take a long time
for me to get over this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Think about it this way: you get to spend the
rest of your life having make-up sex.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Listen, mate, are you coming to this wedding or
not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When we were fighting last night, it hit me.
No one had ever cared about me as much as you cared about Jeffrey.
That�s why I was so angry. I�m sorry I took it out on you – I didn�t
mean to hurt you. And then, I was going to get out of here and leave you
alone, but halfway to the station, I realized–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I�d rather fight with you than make love to
anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: What?! No, no. You can�t–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have to. I�m the best man.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: �Today is a day for love and for beauty. But
most of all, it’s a day for truth.�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I�ve been working on this speech since these
two got engaged. It was supposed to be touching and funny.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I thought I�d come back to England and have an
epiphany. I�d see Amy and the perfect thing would pop into my head and
it would encapsulate how and why I love my sister. But I came home and
everything was a mess and the truth and beauty line was all I could come
up with. And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: A wonderful woman once said about Amy: �It�s
not that I love her more, it�s that she lets me love her.�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: It can be the scariest thing in the world to
let someone love you and to know how to love them back. Take good care
of each other. I love you both.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nice speech. I thought it was �touching�… and
�funny.�</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Since I�ve generously agreed to go out with
you, I think it�s only fair that you tell me how you got into the
business?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know why I never tell the real story of
how I got into this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Because it�s boring. Now if you want to hear a
good story, let me tell you the one about how I got out of it.</p>
