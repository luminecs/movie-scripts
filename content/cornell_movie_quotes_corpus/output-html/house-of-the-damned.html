<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: This is the last time I travel so
far for a job. We won’t get back till nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: Well the pay is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: Not a bad place to live. I wonder
how much it cost.</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: If you have to ask, you probably
can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: Looks like we have our work cut out
for us.</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: I’ll start the upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: Oh Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: Kathleen! For God’s sake what’s
wrong!</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: It’s all right it’s all right!</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: You’re ok, everything’s ok…what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: There were rats…</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: Rats? There are no rats…shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>1st char woman</strong>: Rats everywhere…</p>
<p><strong>2nd char woman</strong>: See? Everything’s ok…there aren’t
any rats.</p>

<p><strong>fade out</strong>: CUT TO EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, it’s moving day, and we finally made it
here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Glen Abbey manor, getting some new
tenants…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let me take you on a tour…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not bad…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Here comes Aubrey, say hi Aubrey.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And there’s Maura, doing a little
unpacking…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I could use a little help. We have to return
the van soon.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ok ok…we’re just gonna head inside here…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is the living room…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Here’s a picture of…someone… she doesn’t look
too happy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ok, this is the upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And down here is a bedroom… let’s take a look
at that -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you doing honey?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Can I have this room daddy?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sure. Did you see the others?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: I want this one, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ok. If you want this room, you can have
it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, we’re not in California anymore… Sure is
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Now remember we have to call someone about
that replacing that water heater.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah I’ll look into that tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I hope we have more success than we did with
the cleaning service.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The place is pretty dusty.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well the realtor said that was going to be
taken care of and it wasn’t. I’ll have to call her.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who knows… we have to get used to living
around here. Maybe good help is hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Must be…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, we’re officially in.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I think the bed should face this way. What do
you think?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh come on…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I just, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What will Aubrey think?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey knows more about us than you
think.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well maybe we don’t need to remind her of it.
She has a lot more to adjust to…new friends, new schools…it would be
good if she had a stable family environment.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: You didn’t think much about that before.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Look, I thought we were all right on this,
Maura. It’s over. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: It’s just going to take a while.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I think I’ll start dinner.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT DINING ROOM - DUSK</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, I suppose I should make a toast.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To Eliza Londrigan, for keeping this house in
the family.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: To our family.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To our family.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I wish I knew more about her.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did anyone in your family keep in touch with
her?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Not really. She was just one of those names
you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really
don’t think anyone knew about this place.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Or what she was worth.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: God rest her soul.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I don’t think she willed it to me out of
sentiment. She didn’t even know who I was. It’s just… tradition.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You must be the new tenants.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And you…are?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: My name is Father Seamus. I’m from Holy Rood
church.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I came to see if everything is all
right.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You must be a Londrigan.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She’s a South now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m Will South. This is Maura, our daughter
Aubrey. This is… Father Seamus?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry to call on you at this hour.
You see, I knew Eliza well, and out of deference to her, I came by…to
welcome you…and to bless this house…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: …at her request. She was a very religious
woman.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Oh, that’s nice…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sure, sure…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: What’s he doing daddy?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He’s blessing the house.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For good luck honey.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Hear us, Holy Lord, and deign to send thy
holy angel from heaven to guard, cherish, protect, visit, and defend all
who dwell in this home.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Thank you. I believe she would have wanted
it.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Did you know her very well?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: She attended the church for years. A dear
woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: It was a shame.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: In her later years she would often get very
disoriented being alone here. She would call me, and I would come
by.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What was she afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks
on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well it’s nice that you were there for
her.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I took pity on the poor woman. This house is
too big for one person to live alone in…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It needs to be filled with the laughter of
children…right?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Did you grow up in Ireland mister?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.
Lived here my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Did you ever see a leprechaun?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: A leprechaun? Well, let me tell you. They’ve
been known to roam the land, and like it very much when you leave a bowl
of milk out for them during the night.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you have dinner, father? We have
plenty.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Well thank you for the offer, But I really
have to go.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I hope everything works out for you, and you
find happiness in your new home.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Perhaps I’ll see you in church.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Uh, we’re not really practicing
Catholics…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Well there’s no time like the present. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well that was strange.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Ah, he’s a nice man. Who knows, maybe he
misses her.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: For the leprechauns.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For the leprechauns.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT MANOR - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Are you playing tricks on me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: It’s not going to work. I’m too smart for
you.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What are you watching?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s the video I made…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t know. That’s strange.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m sure this was a blank tape. I must have
screwed up. Damn it. What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Were you just upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: You didn’t come in and knock over some
books?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Maybe it was Aubrey.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: She’s asleep. I think that’s what I need,
too. I’m starting to see things.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah, well I’ll be joining you shortly. I just
want to…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: …set up some more things.</p>

<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Are your parents in?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Daddy! There’s a man out here!</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: I’m here with the new heater.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, great, c’mon in.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Look daddy! It’s empty!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s great, honey.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: The leprechauns drank it last night!</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Uh huh. Before I bring it in I’ll take the
old one.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ok. It’s down here in the cellar if you want
to follow me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks for coming by. You’re the fourth guy I
had to call!</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Well you called the right man. This new
heater’s a great deal If I do say so meself.</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Fifty gallon capacity, r-foam insulation,
low w.c. manifold and a radial flame spreader!</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: For lower N.O. emissions.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last
night.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well I bet you they’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Can I do it again tonight?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: We’ll have every leprechaun in Ireland here
honey.</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: Hi, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You want a hand with that?</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Sure. The two men begin to WRENCH the
rusted heater free - they pull and pull until the heater begins to slide
off the foundation - soon it is removed -</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Back’s rusted all to hell.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: Hi. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Aubrey…</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: Do you want to play…Aubrey?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The heater’s here.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Were you fooling with the power?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Didn’t you just see the power go off and on?
I just had a bulb break on me!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. I don’t know. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It was in the cellar. Weird.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well something just happened to the power
upstairs… Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event
-</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey, did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Don’t play games with me, little girl.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: I didn’t do anything, mommy.</p>

<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s the matter, Maura?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Some strange things have been going on around
here. Very strange things.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Weird sounds, things moving, lights going
off. The videotape…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I don’t know what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: But do you agree with me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah, I’d say some weird things have
happened.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well what do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, I try to keep an open mind, but…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Maybe Eliza wasn’t so crazy after all.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There’s got to be an explanation. It could be
a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off
something. Who knows? I don’t know, I think it’s kind of
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we
should call someone about it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I don’t know. Someone who…knows about this
kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh come on!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What about keeping an open mind?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just because I have an open mind doesn’t mean
I’m going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo
stick around the house.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Voodoo stick? It’s nothing like that Will.
You’re just being cynical.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual
side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should
count for something.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: It was a monster! It was a monster!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Oh my God - Will!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Shh shh shh!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: It’s going to hurt us!</p>

<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INSERT DOOR IN HALLWAY - DAY</p>
<p><strong>dr. edward shea</strong>: Psychic/Spiritual Advisor</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Did it harm either one of you? Or your
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Did it leave any tracks, or footprints of any
kind?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It just disappeared. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I’m sure this sounds crazy to you.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Not at all. I’m just trying to put together
all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well that’s what we’re here for. I mean -</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I could see if I detect the presence of
something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you have, some kind of meter or
something like that?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: No. But I’m a clairvoyant. I can sometimes
talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Well what would you do, in our case?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Well it all depends on how much money you want
to spend. A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds. That would
include myself and an assistant.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Well, we could bring in special equipment,
monitors, sound devices, things like that.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I think we should do it.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: We’re usually successful in detecting the
source of most problems. Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What do you mean, unfortunately?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: We usually find nothing. We’ve debunked many a
reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some
technical explanation.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What about the other five percent?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Well…it’s that five percent that keeps us
interested…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They don’t build them like this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Suppose not.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Where is your daughter? She might be able to
give us some information.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: She’s at school. We’ve tried not to upset her
more than she’s been.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: That’s understandable. But sometimes spirits
prefer to communicate with children. Innocence, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I feel something. It’s faint, but…it’s
there…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You say you saw some activity here?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Yes. All these cabinets opened by
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Did you see them open?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Uh, no, but -</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See the key to this type of thing is to see it
as it happens - empirical observation is the best way to come to a
conclusion as to cause.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m getting nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I’m feeling something, but it seems as if
it’s…moving…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: This used to be Aubrey’s room. She stays with
us now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Whoa there…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I don’t know…my God…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.
Maybe some kind of a rodent.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So is that what all this is? Someone have a
problem with us living here?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Not someone. Something. I’ve never felt a
presence that strong before.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Ok, so we have a…presence. What do we do
about it?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to
find out why it’s troubled.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Town records are coming up now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What will they tell you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ll be able to do a search, to find out who
lived here previously. And who died here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We know the house was built in 1863. Your
family, the Londrigans, first established residence after the first
world war, so…we have an unknown window, 1863 to 1919.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Do you have any other physical evidence, that
we can look at?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not really. Oh, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I think I do.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Where did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It was nailed to the cellar wall.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I see some faint lettering. It appears to be
the…Runic alphabet?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Runic?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I’m not sure, but I can check. Did the events
start before or after you discovered this?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Before.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Do you mind if I borrow it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Not at all, if it can help.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: These records only go back to 1880. But… …wait
a minute…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Did you find something?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I did a cross search, death certificates with
this address. James and Marion Foster. They had a daughter. Right here,
it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next
year. Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Suicide? How?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It doesn’t say. But that’s not what interests
me. There’s no death certificate for the daughter. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: What was her name?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Colleen.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Colleen…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Honey, isn’t your friend’s name Colleen?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Can you talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She talks to me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: She has a…friend. Colleen.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A friend?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: You, an imaginary friend. That’s what she
calls her.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: What does Colleen say to you?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She says she’s lonely…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She’s here.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Where is she now?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She’s hiding.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Can you take me to her?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She’s down…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: She’s down…how do you mean honey?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Do you mean she’s sad?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: She’s down. Help her…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Take me to her.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Ok…ok…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Well, maybe we’re getting somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Wait a minute. She’s down… Where did you find
that medal again?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In the cellar.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Colleen…Colleen…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: We want to help you…can you talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: If you’re lonely you can talk to
us…Colleen…</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Colleen…can you tell me where you are…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: There’s something in there.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: There’s something through that wall!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well what is it!</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I don’t know! Trust what I’m saying, we have
to open this wall!</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Oh my God…</p>

<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT HOLY ROOD CHURCH - DAY</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: May you find the peace you’ve sought in vain
for so long.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That poor little girl.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: So many unanswered questions. Why was she
buried there. And who killed her?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It might have been her mother.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: We don’t have proof of that.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The style of dress on the girl… it coincides
with the era Marion Foster killed herself. Who else could have gone in
there and done something like that?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’ll never know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over. And
everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want
to…thank all of you, for everything you’ve done for us.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Yes. We’d like to have you over for dinner.
Give a sense of closure to the whole thing. You too, father.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes. It would mean a lot to both of us.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: You’ve done your homework, Mrs. South.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Maura.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: Maura.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Yeah, they told us this was the best.</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: There’s nothing like a nice single malt to
warm the bones.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: One good drink before dinner.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Here’s mud in your eye.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Do you need help with anything?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh no, thank you. Everything’s pretty much
under control.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I have to admit you really have a beautiful
home.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thank you. If you told me two years ago we’d
be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around
here?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, I live about in Wexford. It’s about a five
hour drive.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How did you meet Dr. Shea?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There were a series of lectures about
parapsychology at my university. I went and heard him speak, and became
fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have to admit I was skeptical. Until
now.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So was I. The usual investigation turns up
nothing more times than not.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange
for you as it was for us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes. It was.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: How are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I think everything’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Good. I’ll start bringing things in.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey, come on down and have some
dinner!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Ok…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Colleen?</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Colleen, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: I’m hungry enough to eat a horse.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: You’ll have to settle for turkey.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It looks delicious…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why don’t you pass me your plate?</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Will, will you call Aubrey again?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey! Come on down.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Is white meat all right for you,
Mr. Shea?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: White meat will be fine…</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey…Aubrey!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shea! Shea!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Oh my God Aubrey!!!!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Oh my God where is she!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: She’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey?! Aubrey?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Did you find her?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: The cellar!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aubrey! Aubrey!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: My God what is it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This isn’t happening…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: The amulet…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: …where is it?</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Where have you put the amulet?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What…amulet?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Did you remove anything in the cellar!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes… How do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I was the one who put it there.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Your daughter’s been taken.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn’t
believe me. I’ve been here before to cast evil from this house. The
amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals. It is an
ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets
are all but lost.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So what does that have to do with Aubrey!
Where is she!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: We must return it, if you want your daughter
back.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you getting at!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn’t
believe me. I’ve exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was
there. It wants another soul, the one we’ve taken away. We must weaken
it!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Aubrey may be in grave danger! Where is the
amulet!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I’m going to need a hammer, some nails, a
candle and a pin.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I’m going to need some other things. Some
pearls, and onyx.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: I don’t have any onyx.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Where does this amulet come from?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It’s origin is unknown. The symbol does
correspond to a dagger I acquired many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: The dagger is used to free those possessed
if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: By killing them?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: By freeing them.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: The knife destroys the evil and saves the
soul of the possessed.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do these ingredients mean?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity… Onyx
is the sickle, death…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: As I said, only fragments of ritual exist.
Of what I know, this is the procedure. It seems to have suppressed the
forces of evil, if not removed them altogether…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I’m going to need some blood. It must be
from a woman.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is
part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat,
then takes it -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How long will it take!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: It will not take long…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Now you must listen to me. This force is
like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord… you
must clear your mind as we reach out for her.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: So what should we do, father?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: You have to lead her out. Come over
here…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Talk to her, and remove her fear…only she
can cross over.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey? It’s mommy.</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey? Can you hear me!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Help me! Please!!!</p>
<p><strong>shea</strong>: My God, I heard something!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re here Aubrey! Look, don’t be afraid. We
want you to come back to us…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: It’s dark! I can’t breathe!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Don’t be afraid of it honey. It’s just like a
bad dream. Listen to us…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Keep talking!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It can’t hurt you if you’re not afraid Aubrey.
Think about us. We’re here for you, we love you…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: I can’t move!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fight it back Aubrey. Fight it back as hard as
you can!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Aubrey are you still there!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Concentrate! She can hear you!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Come back to us honey, don’t be afraid!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Mommy please help me!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t be afraid!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Daddy, please!!!</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: She’s coming back. Keep talking!</p>
<p><strong>maura</strong>: Come back to us honey!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Help!!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh my God! She’s in there!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Daddy help!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: All right Aubrey look out! Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s all right baby, just stay back! Cover
your eyes!</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Daddy I’m scared!</p>

what you did…</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I didn’t do anything…God saved her…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful,
more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this
house is behind us.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, I want to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: Take care of the girl. Take care of your
family. They are important.</p>

is a stone’s throw away if you want to come to mass.</p>

<p><strong>seamus</strong>: This evil swallows up innocence and light,
feeds on violence and human fear…the girl is in danger…I have seen this
again and again…nothing in this world can overcome that evil -</p>
<p><strong>seamus</strong>: …save for the power of holy unconditional
love, for that is the one force it can never defeat…this I have
discovered. Should the force return, I fear more drastic measures may be
necessary - I don’t know if they, or I, will have the strength…</p>
