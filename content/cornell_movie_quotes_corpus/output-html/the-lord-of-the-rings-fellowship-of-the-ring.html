<p><strong>black continues… elvish singing….a woman’s voice is</strong>:
whispering, tinged with SADNESS and REGRET:</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: “I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
han mathon ne chae…a han noston ned wilith.” The world is changed: I
feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air…Much
that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: FLICKERING FIRELIGHT. The NOLDORIN FORGE in
EREGION. MOLTEN GOLD POURS from the lip of an IRON LADLE.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: It began with the forging of the Great
Rings.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are
received by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
wisest…fairest of all beings.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the
DWARF LORDS.</p>

and craftsmen of the mountain halls.</p>

MEN…as if holding-close a precious secret.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: And Nine…nine rings were gifted to the
race of Men who, above all else, desire power.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: But they were all of them deceived.</p>
<p><strong>fade up</strong>: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE
EARTH…moving slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME…MORDOR.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: …for another ring was made.</p>
<p><strong>teasing shots</strong>: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the
CHAMBERS of</p>

control all others.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: The ONE RING reflecting FIERY LAVA! FIRE
WRITING emerges on the plain BAND OF GOLD.</p>

flames…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: One Ring to rule them all…</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: A GREAT SHADOW falls across the MAP…closing
in around the realm of GONDOR…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
fell to the power of the ring.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: But there were some…who resisted.</p>
<p><strong>fade up</strong>: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads
an ARMY ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
against the armies of Mordor.</p>

for the freedom of Middle- Earth.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Victory was near!</p>

the ONE RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle…</p>

undone.</p>

ALLIANCE. With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge…THE BLACK</p>

falls like a crumpled rag doll… IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him…</p>

Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON’S ARMOR clatters to the ground. His
body</p>

SEVERED FINGER and removes the ONE RING…transfixed!</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: The Ring passed to Isildur…who had this
one chance to destroy evil forever.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: GLADDEN FIELD…ISILDUR leads a small column of
men through DARKENING WOODS…the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN around his
neck.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: But the hearts of Men are easily
corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.</p>
<p><strong>fade up</strong>: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER…as THE
RING slips slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR’S PALE FACE…he is DEAD.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: It betrayed Isildur to his death.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of
the RIVER</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: And some things that should not have been
forgotten…were lost.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: History became legend…legend became
myth.</p>

undisturbed.</p>

Ring passed out of all knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: SILT SWIRLS…A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down…grasping the RING…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
new bearer!</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one
ring.</p>

took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.</p>

of WATER…in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
mutters in the half light…</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: It came to me. My own. My love… My
preciousness.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of
Gollum’s cave…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: It waited.</p>
<p><strong>fade up</strong>: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies
DARK and STILL…the unsettled quiet before the storm…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Darkness crept back into the forests of
the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the East…whispers of a nameless
fear. And the Ring of Power perceived…its time had now come. It
abandoned Gollum.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to
the MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: But something happened then the Ring did
not intend…</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: FUMBLING in the dark, a SMALL HAND closes
over the</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable…</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: A Hobbit….Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: A Ring.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Lost! Lost! My Precious is lost!!</p>

will shape the fortunes of all.</p>

the</strong>: SHIRE….60 YEARS LATER CAMERA TRACKS TO: a Figure lies
beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor
is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It’s wonderful to see you, Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You didn’t think I’d miss your Uncle
Bilbo’s birthday?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What news of the outside world? Tell me
everything!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: What, everything? Far too eager and curious
for a Hobbit. Most unnatural…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide
world goes on much as if it has past age. Full of its own comings and
goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: …for which I am very thankful.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Ah, the long expected party. So, how is the
old rascal? I hear it’s going to be a Party of Special Magnificence.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You know Bilbo…he’s got he whole place in an
uproar.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Oh, well…that should please him.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Half the Shire’s been invited…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Good gracious, me.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He’s up to something.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Alright then..keep your secrets. Before you
came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Indeed?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Never had any adventures or did anything
unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: If you’re referring to the incident with
the Dragon…I was barely involved…all I did was give your Uncle a little
nudge out the door.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Whatever you did…you’ve been officially
labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf… I’m glad you’re back. Frodo leaps
expertly from the cart. Gandalf smiles.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: So am I, dear boy…so am I</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: No, thank you! We don’t want any more
visitors, well wishers, or distant relations.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: And what about very old friends?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Bilbo Baggins!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: My dear Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It’s good to see you. One hundred and
eleven years old, who would believe it!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You haven’t aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
laugh together and enter Bag End.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Tea? Or maybe something stronger… I’ve a few
bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296…a very good year, almost as old as
I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I was expecting you some time last week. Not
that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always
will.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: You’ve caught me a bit unprepared, I’m
afraid…we’ve only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here…ooh,
no, that might be a little risky…</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Er, we’ve got raspberry jam and apple
tart…got some custard somewhere. Not much for Afters, I’m afraid. Oh
no…we’re alright…I’ve just found some sponge cake. Nice little snack.
Hope it’s enough. I could do you some eggs if you like?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Just tea, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Oh..right. You don’t mind if…?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
knock on the front door.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I’m not home.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I’ve got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment’s
peace. I want to see mountains again…mountains, Gandalf… and then find
somewhere quiet where I can finish my book…Oh, Tea!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: So, you mean to go through with your plan,
then?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Yes, yes…it’s all inhand. All the
arrangements are made.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Frodo suspects something.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: ’Course he does, he’s a Baggins…not some
block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You will tell him, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: He’s very fond of you.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I know. He’d probably come with me if I asked
him. I think, in his heart, Frodo’s still in love with the Shire, the
woods and the fields… little rivers. Bilbo stands gazing out of the
kitchen window.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I am old, Gandalf… Bilbo looks at Gandalf
sadly…</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I know I don’t look it, but I’m beginning to
feel it in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I feel thin…sort of stretched, like butter
scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday…a very long holiday and I
don’t expect I shall return…in fact, I mean not to.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Old Toby, the finest weed in
Southfarthing!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Ohhhh, Gandalf my old friend…this will be a
night to remember!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think I’ll just have myself another ale.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Oh, no you don’t. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: So, there I was…at the mercy of three
monstrous trolls…Have you ever heard of a troll? Do you know what a
Troll is? Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things..and they’re
arguing…arguing about how they were going to cook us!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a
pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us
into jelly! But they spent so long arguing the whether-to’s and
why-for’s that the sun’s first light crept over the top of the trees…and
turned them all to stone!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: No, no..the big one…the big one! Pippin grabs
a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: You’re supposed to stick it in the
ground!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: It is in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Outside!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: It was your idea.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Dragon? Nonsense…hasn1t been a dragon in
these parts for a thousand years!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: That was good!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Let’s get another one!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took…I
might have known!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Speech!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
Brandybucks…Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
Proudfoots…</p>
<p><strong>odo proudfoot</strong>: Proudfeet!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Today is my one hundred and eleventh
birthday. Yes, and alas…Eleventy- one years is far too short a time to
live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of
approval!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I don’t know half of you half as well as I
should like; and I like less than half of you as well as well as you
deserve.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I have..things to do and I have put this off
for far too long… CLOSE ON: BILBO’S knuckles turn white as he tightens
his grip on the small object behind his back.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I regret to announce, this is the end. I am
going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell!! Bilbo looks across at
Frodo, hesitates… then…</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Come on, Gandalf! Did you see their
faces?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There are many magic rings in the world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you’re probably
right as usual.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You will keep an eye on Frodo, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I’m leaving everything to him.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: What about this ring of yours? Is that
staying too?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Yes, yes, it’s in an envelope…over there on
the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece…Bilbo suddenly
feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: No, wait. It’s here in my pocket. Isn’t
that…isn’t’ that odd now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn’t I keep
it?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Well, no…and yes. Now it comes to it, I don’t
feel like parting with it. It’s mine. I found it. It came to me!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There’s no need to get angry.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Well, if I’m angry, it’s your fault! It’s
mine. My own, my precious.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Precious? It’s been called that before, but
not by you.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: So? What business is it of yours what I do
with my own things? Bilbo’s voice, shape and manner have suddenly
changed.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I think you’ve had that ring quite long
enough.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: You want it for yourself!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his
power…a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf’s expression softens.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to
help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: All you long years we’ve been friends…trust
me as you once did. Let it go!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: You’re right, Gandalf…the ring must go to
Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: It’s late, the road is long… yes, it is
time.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Bilbo?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The ring is still in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Bilbo pulls out the ring…he stares at it
in his palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to slowly
slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON: The tiny ring lands
with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I’ve thought up and ending for my book…“And
he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.”</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I’m sure you will, my dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Goodbye, Gandalf.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Goodbye Bilbo.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Until our next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE RING…Glinting on the floor…Gandalf
circles around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring…the creepy Hum rises on
the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his
pipe…staring into the flickering flames.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: It’s mine, my own, my precious.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Riddles in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bilbo! Bilbo!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: My precious…precious..</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He’s gone, hasn’t he? Frodo steps into the
living room.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He talked for so long about leaving…I didn’t
think he’d really do it.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: …my own.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Bilbo’s ring.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: He’s gone to stay with the Elves. He’s left
you Bag End…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: …along with all his possessions.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The ring is yours now. But it somewhere out
of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I have some things I must see to.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Questions. Questions that need
answering.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You’ve only just arrived! I don’t
understand…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe.</p>
<p><strong>images</strong>: THE HUGE DARK TOWER OF BARAD-DUR is being
rebuilt! Thousands of ORCS crawl over the surface, hauling stone and
iron up the towering heights.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Baggins! Shire!!</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: A LONE HORSEMAN gallops to the crest of a
hill on the west road. The main highway south to Minas Tirith…he looks
toward the saw toothed mountains of Mordor… …seeping out across the
blood red sky, his face grave. He spurs his horse on.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Pages flipping as Gandalf searches ancient
scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on one
old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The year 3434 of the Second Age…here
follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of
the ring of power.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It has come to me…the ring of power!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom…all
those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will
risk no hurt to the</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: ring…it is precious to me, though I buy it
with great pain…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The marking upon the band begin to fade…the
writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but
disappeared…a secret now that only fire can tell…</p>
<p><strong>black rider</strong>: Shire? Baggins?</p>
<p><strong>farmer maggot</strong>: There’s no Bagginses around here!
They are all up in Hobbiton…that way.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: FRODO FAREWELLS SAM outside Bag End, and
heads towards the front door. Creepy POV from inside Bag end: Frodo
coming up the path.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Is it secret? Is it safe?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Hold out your hand, Frodo…it is quite
cool.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: What can you see? Can you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Nothing…there’s nothing. Wait…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The Gold Band of the ring as fiery letters
begin to appear…a tiny inscription glows red…as if burning from
within.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: …these are markings.</p>
<p><strong>fro do</strong>: It’s some form of Elvish…I can’t read
it.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There are few who can…the language is that
of Mordor, which I will not utter here.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The ring lies on Frodo’s simple kitchen
table.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom…taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bilbo found it…in Gollom’s cave.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age…but no longer,
Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It has heard its
master’s call.</p>
<p><strong>at that moment: a fleeting, low whisper</strong>: of BLACK
SPEECH</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: But he was destroyed…Sauron was
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
endured. His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived.
Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied…his fortress of Barad- dur
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all
his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns, above all else, to
return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark
lord. Frodo, he must never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the
Ring.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We put it away, we keep it hidden! We never
speak of it again. No one know it’s here, do they? Gandalf shifts
uncomfortably.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Do they, Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There is one other who knew that Bilbo had
the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy
found him first.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A teasing Glimpse of Gollum being tortured
by the Orcs. The wretched creature screams in pain.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I don’t know how long they tortured him…but
amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two
words.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: S…Shire! Baggins!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Shire! Baggins! That will lead them here!</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder
lifts his watch lantern in alarm.</p>
<p><strong>hobbit bounder</strong>: Halt! Who goes there?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Take it! Take it!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You must take it.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You cannot offer me this ring.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I’m giving it to you!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Don’t tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take it,
not even to keep it safe.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Understand, Frodo…I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good…but through me, it would wield a power too
great and terrible to imagine.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: But it cannot stay in the Shire!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, no it can’t.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What must I do?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You must leave, and leave quickly. Get out
of the Shire.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Where? Where shall I go?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Make for the village of Bree.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bree? What about you?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food into his knapsack.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: And the ring will be safe there?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I don’t know, Frodo. I don’t have any
answers. I must see the Head of my Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He’ll know what to go.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You’ll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you…for that name is not safe outside the Shire. GANDALF helps
FRODO into his coat.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Travel only by day and stay off the
road.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I can cut across country easily enough.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a
month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have you
been eavesdropping?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I ain’t been dropping no eaves, sir! Honest. I
was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It’s a little late for trimming the hedges,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I heard raised voices…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: What did you hear? Speak!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing important…that is, I heard a good deal
about a ring…and a Dark Lord. And something about the end of the world,
but…Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don’t hurt me! Don’t turn me into anything
unnatural!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Perhaps not. I’ve thought of a better use
for you.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Come along, Samwise…keep up…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has many
spies in his service, many ways of hearing…birds, beasts…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Is it safe?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Never put it on, for then the agents of the
Dark Lord will be drawn to its power…Always remember, Frodo, the ring is
trying to get back to its master…it wants to be found. Gandalf wheels
his horse and gallops away.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: FRODO AND SAM hiking over the gentle Shire
Countryside…wading through a shallow stream…heating a kettle over a
small fire…clambering over stone walls.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: This is what?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If I take one more step it’ll be the farthest
away from home I’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Come on, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Remember what Bilbo used to say…it’s a
dangerous business…</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: … it’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out
your door…you step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet,
there’s not knowing where you might be swept off to.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Smoke rises once more from the mountain of
doom…the shadow takes shape in the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows
late…and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel…</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: For that is why you have come, is it not,
my old friend?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Saruman!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Are you sure of this?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Beyond any doubt.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: So the ring of power has been found?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: All these long years it was in the Shire,
under my very nose.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: And yet you did not have the wit to see it!
Your love of the Halfling’s leaf has clearly slowed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: We still have time…time enough to counter
Sauron…if we act quickly.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Time? What time do you think we have?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Sauron has regained much of his former
strength. He cannot yet take physical form…but his spirit has lost none
of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees
all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what
I speak, Gandalf…a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The eye of Sauron.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: He is gathering all evil to him.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Very soon he will have summoned an army
great enough to launch an assault upon Middle earth.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You know this? How?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: I have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Why? Why should we fear to use it?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones…we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws
the cloth back over the Palantir.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: The hour is later than you think. Sauron’s
forces are already moving…the Nine have left Minas Morgul.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The nine!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer’s
eve, disguised as riders in black.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: They have reached the Shire? Saruman
shrugs…</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: They will find the ring…and kill the one
who carries it.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: You did not seriously think a Hobbit could
contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Against the power of Mordor, there can be
no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
would be wise, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise
abandon reason for madness?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, but you have elected the way of pain.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns, surprised as
Sam comes running towards him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
suspiciously. Sam glances down, embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s just something Gandalf said…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He said…“Don’t you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.”
And I don’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam…we’re still in the Shire…what could
possibly happen?</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Frodo! Merry, it’s Frodo Baggins.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Hello Frodo</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s the meaning of this!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Sam, hold this…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ve been into Farmer Maggot’s crop!</p>
<p><strong>farmer maggot</strong>: Who’s that in my field! Get out of
it! Get out of my field, you young varmits! I’ll show you…get out of my
corn.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: I don’t know why he’s so upset, it’s only a
couple of carrots.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: And some cabbages…and those three bags of
potatoes that we lifted last week. And then the mushrooms the week
before.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Yes, Pippin, my point is, he’s clearly over
reacting.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: That was close.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Ow…I think I’ve broken something.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What? That was just a detour…a shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A shortcut to what?</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Mushrooms!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the
Loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms!
Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are on a wooded road.
Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling down the road as if blown by
an invisible wind…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I think we should get off the road.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Get off the road!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: The Black rider was looking for something…or
someone…Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I have to leave the Shire…Sam and I must get
to Bree.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Right…Buckleberry Ferry…follow me !</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: There’s another one!! Frodo, this way! !</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Frodo, follow me!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Get the ropes, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: How far to the nearest crossing?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: The brandwine bridge…twenty miles.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We’re headed for the prancing pony.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what’s more,
out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We wish to stay at the inn…our business is
our own. To Frodo’s relief, the Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: All right, young sir, I meant no
offense.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: It’s my job to ask questions after
nightfall. There’s talk of strange fold abroad…can’t be too careful.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>butterbur</strong>: Good evening, little masters. If you’re
seeking accommodation, we’ve got some nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms
available, Mr…ah…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Underhill…my name’s Underbill.</p>
<p><strong>butterbur</strong>: Underhill? Hmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We’re friends of Gandalf the Grey…can you
tell him we’ve arrived? BUTTERBUR frowns…</p>
<p><strong>butterbur</strong>: Gandalf…Gandalf…Oh… Oh yes! I
remember…elderly chap…big grey beard…pointy hat? Frodo nods with
relief…Butterbur shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>butterbur</strong>: Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam, he’ll be here. He’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: This, my friend, is a pint.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: It comes in pints? I’m getting one!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ve had a whole half already. Merry watches
Pippin go.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That fellow’s done nothing but stare at you
since we’ve arrived.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
he?</p>
<p><strong>butterbur</strong>: He’s one of them Rangers; they’re
dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I
never heard, but round here he’s known as Strider.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Strider.</p>
<p><strong>beneath table</strong>: FRODO’S fingers are nervously TOYING
WITH THE</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins…he’s over
there…</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Frodo Baggins. He’s my second cousin once
removed, on his mother’s side and my third cousin twice removed on his
father’s side…if you follow me.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Pippin!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Steady on, Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of
the ring: THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow motion…distorted
voices…a weird photographic negative quality. FRODO is moving in real
time; against the slow motion background. He suddenly clutches his head
as he is hit with quick images…of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE EYE,
wreathed in flames.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You draw far too much attention to
yourself…Mr. Underhill</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: A little more caution from you…that is no
trinket you carry.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I carry nothing.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen if I
wish, but to disappear entirely… that is a rare gift.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Are you frightened?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Not nearly frightened enough. I know what
hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor. Strider
deftly draws his sword.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let him go or I’ll have you, Longshanks!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You have a stout heart, little Hobbit, but
that alone won’t save you…You can no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: the front door FLIES OPEN. The FOUR
RINGWRAITHS rush into the PRANCING PONY with WICKED SWORDS DRAWN.
CLOSE</p>
<p><strong>on</strong>: BUTTERBUR hiding behind his bar… trembling and
sweating in TERROR.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: PIPPIN stirs slightly, then settles back to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: the door creaks open…THE FOUR RINGWRAITHS
silently slide into the Hobbit’s room. The LOOM above each bed, raising
their SHINING SWORDS ABOVE THE SLEEPING HOBBITS.</p>
<p><strong>quick insert</strong>: Sam’s eyes open wide. In unison, the
RINGWRAITS STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>rage!! inserts</strong>: Sam sits up with a start! Close on:
Another shredded pillow is revealed! More Shrieks of rage. INSERT:
PIPPIN AND MERRY wake with a start.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping
on Strider’s bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering
out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard
from the Hobbits room.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They were once men. Strider glances quickly
at Frodo, then looks away…</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of Power. Blinded by their greed they
took them without question, one by one falling into darkness and now
they are slaves to his will.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
living or dead. At all times they feel the presence of the ring…drawn to
the power of the one..they will never stop hunting you.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Where are you taking us?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Into the wild.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: How do, we know this Strider is a friend of
Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We have no choice but to trust him.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: But where is he leading us?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: To Rivendell, Master Gamgee…to the house of
Elrond.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! We’re going
to see the Elves!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Gentlemen, we do not stop until
nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What about breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You’ve already had it.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: We’ve had one, yes…but what about Second
Breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: I don’t think he knows about second
breakfast, Pip.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
Tea, dinner…he knows about them, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: I wouldn’t count on it.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Pippin!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: The power of Isengard is at your command,
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Build me an army worth of Mordor.</p>
<p><strong>orc overseer</strong>: What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What
does the eye command?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: We have work to do.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: GANDALF…lying unconscious on a cold
obsidian floor. He wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing…rising onto
his knees…lifting his head… Gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to
reveal him stranded on the summit of Orthanc. He is marooned on the
tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP.
Another whispering wail rends the air. Gandalf crosses quickly to the
edge and peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being
ripped from the ground by the ORCS. Gandalf looks on in Horror as ORCS
hack into the trunk with axes.</p>
<p><strong>orc overseer</strong>: The trees are strong, my Lord. Their
roots go deep.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Rip them all down.</p>
<p><strong>camera circles summit</strong>: MORE AND MORE TREES are
hauled down and killed…as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: This was once the great Watchtower of Amon
Sul. We shall rest here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: There are for you. Keep them close. I’m
going to have a look around. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo
desperately kicks dirt on the fire!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Oh, that’s nice…ash on my tomatoes!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Go! !</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Back, you devils!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Help him, Strider!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: He’s been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
Morgul Blade suddenly melts…vanishing into the air like smoke. Strider
throws the hilt down in disgust…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do something.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs
Elvish medicine. Strider lifts Frodo onto his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
groans.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Hold on, Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’ll never make it! Close on: Frodo…head
lolling about, barely conscious.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf…Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Is he going to die? Frodo’s breathing is
getting shallow. Strider looks out into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: No. He is passing into the shadow world, he
will soon become a wraith like them.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: They’re close.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam
looks blank.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Athelas?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Kingsfoil.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Kingsfoil. Aye. It’s a weed.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: What is this? A Ranger caught off his
guard?</p>
<p><strong>flash insert</strong>: An ethereal vision of ARWEN, as she
appears on the other side…</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Frodo, Im Arwen…telin let thaed. I am Arwen,
I have come here to help you. Lasto Beth nin, tolo Dan na ngalad. Hear
my voice, come back to the light. Frodo’s eyes close.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s an elf.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: He’s fading…he’s not gong to last. We must
get him to my father. Strider quickly lifts Frodo…placing him on the
horse.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: I have been looking for you for two days.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Where are you taking him?</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: There are five Wraiths behind you, where the
other four are, I do not know.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Dartho guin Berian…rych le ad tolthathon.
Stay with the hobbits…I’11 send horses for you. Close on: Arwen grabbing
the Reins of the horse.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Hon mabathon. Rochoh ellint im. I’ll take
him. I’m the faster rider. Strider clamps his hand over Arwen’s.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Andelu I ven. The road is too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Frodo Fir. Ae anthradon I hir, tur gwaith nin
beriatha hon. If I can cross the river, the power of my people can
protect him.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Arwen reaches for Strider’s hand…looking
deep into his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: I do not fear them.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Strider…we see that it is hard for him to
let her go.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Arwen…ride hard, don’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Noro Lim, Asfaloth, Noro Lim!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you doing! Those Wraiths are still out
there!</p>
<p><strong>speeding pov</strong>: through the forest from the back of
the White Horse.</p>
<p><strong>aerial</strong>: of Arwen’s white horse emerging from the
trees…and galloping across the open land as the sun rises.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Noro lim, Asfaloth!</p>
<p><strong>crane down</strong>: As the White Horse races towards Camera,
to Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground.</p>
<p><strong>witch king</strong>: Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws
her sword and yells at the Witch King.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: If you want him, come and claim him.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin
Briunen Dan in Ulaer!</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin
Bruinen Dan in Ulaer!</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: No, no…Frodo, no! Frodo, don’t give in…not
now!</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: What grace is given me, let it pass to him.
Let him be spared. Save him.</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares…Frodo squeezes
his eyes shut, gasping.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You are in the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o’clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Yes, I’m here and you’re lucky to be here,
too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What happened, Gandalf? Why didn’t you meet
us?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I’m sorry Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I was delayed.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Get up! So much for the power of the Ring
or embrace your own destruction!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
one who can bend it to his will…and he does not share power.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: So you have chosen death!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his
attention to Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Nothing, Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you’re awake!!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Sam has hardly left your side.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We were worried about you–weren’t we,
Mr. Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: By the skills of Lord Elrond, you’re
beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to
Frodo’s</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. Frodo
sits up, looking at Elrond with awe.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: RIVENDELL… a small cluster of elegant Elven
Buildings sitting in a Shangri-la like Valley below towering cliffs and
snow capped mountains.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: You have found your way to the last homely
house east of the sea. The elves of Imladris have dwelt within this
valley for three thousand years through few of my kin now remain. Frodo
looks out from his balcony.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Frodo! Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bilbo!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Hello, Frodo, my lad!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Bilbo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: “There and back again: A Hobbit’s tale” by
Bilbo Baggins.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: This is wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I meant to go back…wander the paths of
Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again…but age, it
seems, has finally caught up with me.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I miss the Shire…I spent all my childhood
pretending I was off somewhere else…off with you, on one of your
adventures… But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different…I’m
not like you, Bilbo.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: My dear boy…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to reveal
Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Packed already?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls to the
edge of the Balcony.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I do…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: More than anything.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I did. It’s just…we did what Gandalf wanted,
didn’t we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell…and I thought… seeing
as how you’re on the mend, we’d be off soon. Off home.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You’re right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: …we did what we set out to do. Frodo opens
his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
ready to go home.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: His strength returns.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: That wound will never fully heal. He will
carry it the rest of his life.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: And yet to have come so far still bearing
the Ring…the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It is a burden he should never have to had
to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron’s
forces are massing in the east. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And
Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows
thin.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: His treachery runs deeper than you know. By
foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men…he is breeding an
army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and
cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: This evil cannot be concealed by the power
of the Elves…We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and
Isengard…Gandalf…the ring cannot stay here.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: This peril belongs to all Middle earth. They
must decide how to end it. Not just for themselves but for those who
come after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: The time of the Elves is over. My people are
leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we have gone? The
dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing
for the troubles of others.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It is in Men that we must place our
hope.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is
failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity
forgotten. It is because of men the Ring survives.</p>
<p><strong>flash insert</strong>: With the broken sword, Isildur slices
off Sauron’s finger. Elrond reacts.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: I was there, Gandalf…I was there three
thousand years ago when Isildur took the ring.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: I was there the day the strength of Men
failed.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Isildur…hurry…follow me! IMAGES: ELROND
leads Isildur into the steaming volcano.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: I let Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom,
where the ring was forged: the one place it could be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Cast it into the fire…destroy it!</p>
<p><strong>isildur</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Isildur!!</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: It should have ended that day, but evil was
allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring…and the line of Kings was
broken. There’s no strength left in the world of Men. They’re scattered,
divided, leaderless.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There is one who could unite them, one who
could re claim the thrown of Gondor.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: He turned from that path a long time ago. He
has chosen exile.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: The shards of Narsil…the blade that cut the
Ring from Sauron’s hand. Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches
the Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir’s
finger…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Still sharp.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: But no more than a broken heirloom.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: replaces the Broken blade, but it clatters
to the floor. Boromir walks away, leaving Strider sitting alone.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur’s
heir…not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: The same blood flows in my veins…the same
weakness…</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Your time will come. You will face the same
evil…and you will defeat it. A si i-duath u-orthor, Aragorn…u or le a u
or nin. The shadow does not hold sway yet…not over you and not over
me.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Renech I lu I erui govannem? Do you remember
when we first met?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen. I thought I
had strayed into a dream.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Gwenin in enniath…u-arnech in naeth I se
celich. Long years have passed…you did not have the care you carry
now.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember what
I told you? Arwen reaches for Strider’s hand…</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You said you’d bind yourself to me,
forsaking the immortal life of your people.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: And to that I hold. I would rather share one
lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. Strider
looks down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: I choose a mortal live.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You cannot give me this.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: It is mine to give to whom I will, like my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Strangers from distant lands … friends of
old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.
You will unite…or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate…this
one doom…</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Bring forth the ring, Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: So it is true!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Sauron’s Ring! The ring of power!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: The doom of man!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: It is a gift…a gift to the foes of Mordor!
Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
the forces of Mordor at bay…by the blood of our people are your lands
kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy…let us use it against
him!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You cannot wield it. None of us can. The
one ring answers to Sauron alone…it has no other master. Boromir turns
and looks at Strider, coolly.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: And what would a ranger know of this
matter?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son
of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Aragorn? This is Isildur’s heir?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: And heir to the throne of Gondor.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Havo dad, Legolas…Sit down, Legolas..</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Gondor needs no king.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Aragorn is right…we cannot use it.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: You have only one choice..the ring must be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Then…what are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of
Gloin, by any craft that we</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: here possess. The ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom…only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into
Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of
you must do this.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that
does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren
wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust…the very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is
folly.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
said? The ring must be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: And I suppose you think you’re the one to do
it?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: I will be dead before I see the Ring in the
hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
FRODO…sound disappears as he watches in slow</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Never trust an Elf!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE RING fills the screen…streams of blood
flow across the surface… flames flicker within the Gold Band.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Do you not understand? While we bicker
among ourselves, Sauron’s power grows! No one will escape it. You will
all be destroyed, your homes burnt and your families put to the
sword!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: FRODO…breathing rapidly, Caught in the
grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his
gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands…he speaks in a strong, clear
voice.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I will take it…I will take it…I will take the
Ring to Mordor.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Though…I do not know the way. Gandalf rises
to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: If, by my life or death, I can protect you,
I will. …you have my sword. Aragorn steps forward…followed by Legolas
and Gimli.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: And you have my bow.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: And my axe.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: You carry the fate of us all, little
one.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: If this is indeed the will of the Council,
then Gondor will see it done.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo’s not gong anywhere without me.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: No, Indeed…it is hardly possible to separate
you…even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Oi! We’re coming too! You’ll have to send us
home tied up in a sack to stop us.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Anyway…you need people of intelligence on
this sort of mission…quest…thing…</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Well, that rules you out, Pip.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Nine companions … so be it. You shall be the
“Fellowship of the ring”</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Great. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: My old sword “Sting”…here, take it!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It’s so light!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know. The
blade glows blue when Orcs are close…and it’s times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Here’s a pretty thing. Mithril, as light as a
feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Frodo peels off his shirt… revealing The
Ring on the Chain around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Oh! My old Ring… Frodo frowns as Bilbo moves
toward him.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I should very much like to hold it again, one
last time. Bilbo reaches forward, eyes locked on the ring.</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bilbo</strong>: I’m sorry, that I brought this upon you, my
boy…I’m sorry that you must carry this burden. I’m sorry for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: We must hold to his course west of the
misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will
still be open to us. From there, our road turns east, to Mordor.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Sam at the campfire. The sound of clashing
swords! Wider: Aragorn and Boromir are giving Pippin Sword tuition…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Get away from the blade, Pippin…on your
toes…good, very good…I want you to react, not think.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Should not be too hard…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Move your feet.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Quite good, Pippin.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf….</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I
note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round.
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would
give us a royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, Gimli. I would not take the road
through Moria unless I had no other choice.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Nothing…it’s just a wisp of a cloud.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: It’s moving fast…against the wind.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Crebain from Dunland!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Hide!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Merry..Pippin…Sam…take cover! WIDE</p>
<p><strong>on</strong>: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little
cover</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Spies of Saruman. The passage South is
being watched.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: We must take the pass of Caradhras!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Boromir?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: It is a strange fate that we should suffer
so much fear and doubt over so small a thing…such a little thing.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Boromir…give the ring to Frodo. ARAGORN’S
HAND moves to his sword hilt.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: As you wish. I care not.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: So, Gandalf…you try to lead them over
Caradhras. And if that fails…where then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP
struggles through the snow.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: If the mountain defeats you, will you risk
a more dangerous road?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: There is a fell voice in the air.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It’s Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: He’s trying to bring down the mountain.
Gandalf! We must turn back!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No!</p>
<p>****: Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I ruith. Sleep Caradhras,
be still, lie still, hold your wrath.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: We must get off the mountain! Make for the
gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
Isengard.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us go
under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned
look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
don’t you? The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: You know what they awoke in, the darkness
of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Let the ringbearer decide.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing
heavily upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir’s
arms.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We will go through the mines. Gandalf slowly
nods.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: The walls of Moria!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Itidin…it mirrors only starlight and
moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It reads, “The door of Durin, Lord of
Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.”</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What do you suppose that means?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It’s quite simple. If you are a friend,
speak the password and the doors will open.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Mines are no place for a Pony, even one so
brave as Bill.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bye, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Go on, Bill, go on..don’t worry, Sam…he
knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on the rump…Bill goes trotting
off. CLOSE</p>
<p><strong>on</strong>: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Goodbye, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Do not disturb the water.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It’s a riddle…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Speak, friend, and enter. What’s the Elvish
for friend?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Oh…mellon.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the
bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin…and they call
this a Mine… A mine!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: This is no mine…it’s a tomb!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Oh…no…no..no… ! Legolas pulls a crude arrow
out of a skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Goblins!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should
never have come here.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Into the mines!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Legolas!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: We now have but one choice…we must face the
long dark of Moria. Be on your guard…there are older and fouler things
than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge
above deep mine workings.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Quietly, now. It’s a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I have no memory of this place.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Are we lost?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: No. I don’t think we are. Shhhh, Gandalf’s
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Merry!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>fro do</strong>: There’s something down there.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: It’s Gollum.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gollum!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: He’s been following us for three days.</p>
<p><strong>teasing shot</strong>: and emaciated, leering creature.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Escaped…or was set loose. And now the Ring
has drawn him here…he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol’s life is a sad
story. Gandalf catches Frodo’s look of surprise.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Yes…Smeagol he was once called…Before the
ring came to him, before it drove him mad.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It’s a pity Bilbo didn’t kill him when he had
the chance.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand.
Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you
give it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment…even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that
Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I wish the ring had never come to me…I wish
none of this had happened.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf’s
voice.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the
ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it…and that is an
encouraging thought, Ah! That it’s that way! Gandalf points at the right
hand tunnel…the Fellowship scramble to their feet.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: He’s remembered!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: No, but the air doesn’t smell so foul down
there. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose! Ye s…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
taps his staff…for a brief moment a light</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city of
Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far
above</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, there’s an eye opener and no mistake!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Gimli!!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: No…no…oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: “Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
Moria.” He is dead, then. It’s as I had feared.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: We must move on, we cannot linger.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: “They have taken the Bridge and the second
hall: we have barred the gates…but cannot hold them for long…the ground
shakes…drums in the deep…we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark.
Will no- one save us? They are coming.”</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time
and rid us of your stupidity!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Orcs !</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: They have a cave troll!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
Moria who still draws breath!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think I’m getting the hang of this.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Aragorn! Aragorn!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I’m alright. I’m not hurt.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You should be dead. That spear would’ve
skewered a wild boar!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I think there’s more to this hobbit than
meets the eye.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master
Baggins.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: To the bridge of Khazad-dum!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: What is this new devilry?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
This foe is beyond any of you! Run! Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is
near.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Do as I say; swords are no more use
here.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
through the wall and spreads its vast wings.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: It swoops down past the Fellowship,
disappearing into a flaming pit!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Over the bridge! Fly!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You cannot pass!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder
of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of
Udun.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
at Gandalf with its Sword of</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You shall not pass!! The Balrog places one
foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and Boromir race forward, swords
drawn.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Fly, you fools!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away…
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries out! Boromir
scoops him up and carries him away.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Legolas, get them up!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Give them a moment…for pity’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: By nightfall these hills will be swarming
with Orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothlorien. Come, Boromir,
Legolas, Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back at
Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if in a daze.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo? Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS…a look of numb shock on
his devastated face. The Fellowship marches on.</p>
<p><strong>wide on</strong>: The fellowship run across a forest floor
strewn with yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars…the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks nervously
around…</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf- witch of terrible power. All who
look upon her fall under her spell…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: And are never seen again!</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: …your coming to us is as the footsteps of
doom. You bring great evil here, Ringbearer.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Well, here’s one dwarf she won’t ensnare so
easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!</p>
<p><strong>haldir</strong>: The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
shot him in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
help. We need your protection.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We should
go back.</p>
<p><strong>haldir</strong>: You have entered the realm of the Lady of
the Wood. You cannot go back.</p>
<p><strong>haldir</strong>: Come, she is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>celeborn</strong>: Eight there are, yet nine there were set
out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf, for I much desire to
speak with him.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: …he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
looks to Aragorn.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: The Quest stands upon the edge of a
knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all…Yet hope
remains while the company is true.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Galadriel’s
eyes turn to Frodo…her voice fades.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Tonight you will sleep in peace. Welcome,
Frodo of the Shire… CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:
GALADRIEL as she is on the other</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: …one who has seen the eye.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: A lament for Gandalf…</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What do they say about him?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
the grief is still too near. Boromir is sitting alone…Aragorn approaches
him.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Take some rest..these borders are well
protected.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I will find no rest here. I heard her voice
inside my head…she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she
said to me: “Even now, there</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: is hope left. But I cannot see it…it is
long since we had any hope.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: My father is a noble man, but his rule is
failing and our..our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things
right…and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have
you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like
a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning
breeze…have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver
trumpets?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I have seen the white city..long ago.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: One day our paths will lead us there, and
the tower guards shall take up the call “the Lords of Gondor have
returned.”</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
looks with apprehension at the silver basin.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What will I see?</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Even the wisest cannot tell for the
mirror shows many things…things that were ..things that are…and some
things that have not yet come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: Hobbiton…now an Industrial wasteland! The
fields and trees destroyed…replaced with Brick factories belching smoke!
IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the Factories! We see
Sam…Merry… and Rosie Cotton. Soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear
into the factory hell- hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark…and out of
the black abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to
move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches above the
water…not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire erupts around the eye…
With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses
on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses…he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved,
untouched by the horror.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: I know what it is you saw…for it is also
in my mind. It is the future, Frodo. It is what will come to pass if you
should fail.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: The fellowship is breaking. It has
already begun. He will try to take the ring. You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: If you ask it of me, I will give you the One
Ring.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: You offer it to me freely…I do not deny
that my heart has greatly desired this.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous
as the Sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth…all shall love me
and despair! Frodo takes a step away from Galadriel…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: I pass the test. I will diminish and go
into the west and remain Galadriel. Frodo’s confidence drains away.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I cannot do this alone…</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: You are the ring-bearer, Frodo…to bear a
ring of power is to be alone. This task was appointed to you, and if you
do not find a way, no one will.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Then I know what I must do. It’s just…I’m
afraid to do it. Galadriel kneels down to Frodo’s height, staring at him
intently.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Even the smallest person can change the
course of the future.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
Powers … tortured and mutilated…a ruined and terrible form of life. And
now…perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?</p>
<p><strong>lurtz</strong>: Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: LURTZ is quickly armored…Breastplate…Leg
guards, Helmet…a sword is thrust in Lurtz’s hand. The URUK- HAI are
smearing themselves in white paint…a creepy ritualistic ceremony…the
white hand of Isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN
address a crowd of 200 fully armed URUK-HAI.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are
found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste
man-flesh. Saruman turns to Lurtz.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: One of the Halflings carries something of
great value…bring him to me…alive and unspoiled…kill the others.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
light of Earendil, our most beloved star.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: May it be a light for you in dark places,
when all other lights go out.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: The Argonath…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Long have I desired to look upon the kings
of old…my kin.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our
way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
after that gets even better…a festering, stinking marshland, far as the
eye can see.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: That is our Road…I suggest you take some
rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Recover my…</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: We should leave now.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We must
wait for cover of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: It is not the Eastern shore that worries
me.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: A shadow and a threat has been growing in
my mind. Something draws near, I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Where’s Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: None of us should wander alone; you least
of all. So much depends on you…Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I
see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Let me help you. There are other ways,
Frodo..other paths that we might take.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I know what you would say, and it would seem
like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Warning? Against what?</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
fear drive us to destroy what hope we have…don’t you see that is
madness?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: There is no other way.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I ask only for the strength to defend my
people. If you would but lend me the ring…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: No. . .</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Why do you recoil? I am no thief.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You are not yourself.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: What chance do you think you have? They
will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before
the end.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: You fool! It is not yours save by unhappy
chance…it might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
me the ring.</p>
<p><strong>frodo disappears</strong>: Boromir spins wildly around,
yelling into thin air!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I see your mind…you will take the ring to
Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us
all.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!
Boromir stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the Throes of a
fit…slowly he comes to.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,
Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I’m sorry, Frodo…Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves towards
Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Where is the ring?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo…I swore to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Can you protect me from yourself?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Would you destroy it?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I would have gone with you to the end… into
the very fires of Mordor.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I know…Look after the others, especially
Sam…he will not understand.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Go, Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Run! Run!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>lurtz</strong>: Find the Halflings … find the halflings!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Hide here, quick!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: He’s leaving.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Pippin!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: The horn of Gondor!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Boromir!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>merry &amp; pippin</strong>: Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: They took the little ones…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
of Blood from Boromir’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Frodo…where is Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I let Frodo go.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Then you did what I could not. I tried to
take the ring from him.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: The ring is beyond our reach now.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
you all.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have
kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir’s wound.</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Leave it! It is over…the world of Men will
fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I do not know what strength is in my blood,
but I swear to you… I will not let the White City fall, nor your people
fail…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: Our people…our people…</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: I would have followed you, my brother…my
captain, my King. Aragorn lays Boromir down. He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
and Kisses Boromir’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Legolas and Gimli appear behind him…Aragorn
stands.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They will look for his coming from the
white tower…but he will not return.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish
none of this had happened…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: So do all who lie to see such times…but
that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in the
boat, paddling steadfastly away from the</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: No, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Go back,Sam. I’m going to Mordor alone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Of course you are…and I’m coming with you!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You can’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I made a promise, Mr. Frodo…a promise. “Don’t
you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.” And I don’t mean to…I don’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Oh, Sam!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Come on then..</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
Sam before nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: You mean not to follow them…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Frodo’s fate is no longer in our hands.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Then it has all been in vain…the fellowship
has failed.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Not if we hold true to each other. We will
not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have
strength left.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Leave all that can be spared behind…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: ARAGORN..a steely light in his eye.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We travel light. Let’s hunt some Orc.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Yes! Ha!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Mordor! I hope the others find a safer
road.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Strider’ll look after them.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I don’t suppose we’ll ever see them
again.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I’m glad you’re with me.</p>
