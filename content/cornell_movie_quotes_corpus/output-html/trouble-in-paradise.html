<h1 id="trouble-in-paradise">trouble-in-paradise</h1>
<p><strong>med. shot door of a house</strong>: A cheap residential
district. The house has no architectural character; it is not certain
where we are. Near the entrance door is a garbage can, full.</p>
<p><strong>long shot a gondola</strong>: Two tourists. Husband and wife.
They are in a sentimental embrace. In back is the gondolier. Camera
follows gondola a few seconds, coming closer.</p>
<p><strong>another gondola</strong>: Camera shoots down. Gondola is
covered by a typical little canopy, so that gondolier cannot see the
passengers. Camera cuts canopy on one side so that we don’t see, at
first, who is paddling. In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown,
lots of jewels. She lies in the arms of the gondolier. They kiss. Camera
moves up and discovers who is paddling the boat. It is the husband of
the lady who is having such a good time with the gondolier. Husband is
in tuxedo and straw hat, smoking a long cigar. He is enjoying it like a
child with a new toy.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>wife’s voice</strong>: Yes, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: What a canal!</p>
<p><strong>sidewalk</strong>: in front of the hotel. Camera shoots down
from the hotel on the sidewalk, including part of sidewalk and canal.
The water reflects the electric-lighted name of the hotel. At sidewalk
is moored a gondola in which are four people. A man climbs out, starts
to sing, the others in the gondola playing accompaniment. We hear a
romantic Italian song, irresistible. The four look up to the hotel
windows, expecting coins.</p>
<p><strong>hotel room int.</strong>: photographed against the open
window. In the background is the canal. Through the window we hear the
street singers. Near the window is a table where five men are in a poker
game, not listening to the music. We hear, over the music, the rattling
of the chips. After a few moments the noise of the chips stops and the
singing comes through more clearly. Casually one of the men, cards in
hand, walks to the window, closes it, and returns to game.</p>
<p><strong>another hotel room close shot</strong>: at open window. A
woman is on a chair by a small table, telephoning.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Uh-huh … Uh-huh …</p>
<p><strong>another hotel room</strong>: Shooting over the bed toward an
open window. Same singers are heard. On the bed, in the foreground, is a
woman lying in her chemise and crying. In the background, sitting on the
arm of a chair which is by the open window, is an elegantly dressed man.
Evening clothes, overcoat, hat, walking stick. Annoyed by the crying and
by the outside music, he gets up and slams the window shut with a
bang.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois’s hotel room med. shot</strong>: In the background
is an open window with French doors leading to a little balcony. This
room is on the other side of the hotel, looking out on a side canal.
Close outside the window we see trees. The same music is still audible,
but much fainter. Near the window is a desk. The drawer is open and all
the papers are scattered on the floor. At the other side of the window
is a trunk, open, all the drawers out and the contents thrown around.
Room looks as if it has been rifled. For a little while we hear nothing
but the faint music. Then we hear the door buzzer. There is no reaction.
The buzzer rings again. Suddenly from behind the camera, a man comes
into the picture. He is in a tuxedo. His back is to the camera, so we
cannot identify him. He goes quickly to the window, jumps from balcony
to a tree, and, climbing down, disappears. Buzzer rings again.</p>
<p><strong>[ext.hotel med. shot</strong>: On wall in moonlight. We see
shadow of tree and of man as he reaches the ground. In silhouetted
shadow, we see him take off moustache and sideburns and toss them out of
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois’s hotel room med. shot</strong>: toward window, low.
Camera draws back and comes to a close shot on the feet of a man
outstretched on the floor behind the camera. Buzzer is heard again,
loud.]</p>
<p><strong>hotel corridor close shot</strong>: at room door. We see the
numbers 253, 5, 7, 9. At the door are two Italian dames, obviously
disreputable. One is pushing the buzzer. They speak in Italian, but
their emphasis and pantomime make the following clear to English-
speaking audiences: Girl No. 1 brought Girl No. 2 to see the gentleman
of room 253. Girl No. 1 rings again. Girl No. 2 complains to Girl No. 1
that she should have known better than to have brought her here and
wasted her time. Girl No. 1 apologizes and indicates her watch as if to
say, “The appointment was definite. I can’t understand it.” She rings
again–viciously this time.</p>
<p><strong>long shot fran�ois’s hotel room</strong>: Sprawled on the
floor, his head resting on a chair, Fran�ois is motionless. We see that
a crime has been committed. Fran�ois is an elegant man, about
thirty-five, a conceited bon vivant. He is in a tuxedo. We hear the
buzzer, insistent.</p>
<p><strong>corridor close shot</strong>: at door Girl No. 1 presses
buzzer angrily. Girl No. 2 accuses her loudly. Girl No. 1 answers just
as loud. Girl No. 1 now bangs on the door, shouting insults to occupant
of the room. Girl No. 2 joins her.</p>
<p><strong>close shot hotel corridor</strong>: at door across the hall
from room 253. It is numbered 254. We hear the voices of the angry
Italian girls. The door opens, and an old gentleman, white beard,
dressing gown over evening clothes, steps out. He politely but firmly
asks, in Italian, for silence.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door room 253</strong>: The girls turn quickly
toward the man. No. 2 says she can talk as much as she wants to.</p>
<p><strong>close-up old gentleman</strong>: He states emphatically that
he won’t stand for this.</p>
<p><strong>close-up girl no. 1</strong>: She looks over the old
gentleman and makes a nasty personal remark.</p>
<p><strong>close-up old gentleman</strong>: He loses his temper and
insults the girls venomously.</p>
<p><strong>close shot two girls</strong>: They are at the height of
their fury. No. 2 walks out quickly toward the old gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door room 254</strong>: Old gentleman is in the
open doorway. Girl approaches. The two stand toe-to-toe trading verbal
punches. The old man, disgusted, retreats. He is about to close door,
but girl, still vociferous, follows him into his room and closes door
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>close shot girl no. 1</strong>: Still in front of 253. In the
sudden silence, she looks amazed toward 254. No. 2 has disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>close shot door room 254</strong>: Door opens quickly. No. 2
sticks her head out and, with a characteristic jerk, says in Italian,
“Come in.” She disappears, door slightly ajar.</p>
<p><strong>close shot girl no. 1</strong>: at 253 She goes to 254,
enters, closes the door. The camera swings fast to opposite side of
corridor and stops at 253. We hear telephone ringing inside.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois’s hotel room</strong>: Shooting from outside of the
window into the room. In the foreground is the window frame. We see
Fran�ois on the floor. Phone is ringing. Fran�ois awakes, tries to
struggle to his feet. But, still under the influence of dope, he falls.
As he falls he drags with him, from nearby little table, a tray with
glasses, making a loud noise.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, sir? What shall we start with,
Baron?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Oh, yes … Well, that’s not so easy.
Beginnings are always difficult.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: If Casanova suddenly … turned out to be
Romeo … having supper with Juliet–who might become Cleopatra … How would
you start?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I would start with cocktails.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot gondola</strong>: In gondola, Lily, in evening
dress, looks up at Gaston and waves graciously.</p>
<p><strong>balcony close shot</strong>: Gaston and waiter. Gaston
bows–the bow of a gentleman to a lady of degree–and waves back. This is
the woman he is waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It must be the most marvelous supper. We may
not eat it, but it must be marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And, waiter–you see that moon?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I want to see that moon in the
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I want to see–</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And as for you, waiter–</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t want to see you at all!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: No, Baron! I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>telephone room of hotel close shot</strong>: of an operator.
In the background we see two other operators. We hear the girls
answering in Italian. Our operator is delivering a lengthy message.
While she is talking she looks up to the switchboard because she
sees:</p>
<p><strong>close shot switchboard</strong>: at No. 253. The light is
flashing on and off very quickly. We hear the operator’s voice, still
busy with the message she is delivering. Now she plugs in on 253.</p>
<p><strong>close shot glass door</strong>: In Italian, English, French,
and German: Manager. Door opens and manager hurries out.</p>
<p><strong>big close-up operator</strong>: talking very fast in Italian,
reporting the robbery to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>close shot a door</strong>: opens, and another man,
apparently a detective, comes out.</p>
<p><strong>staircase</strong>: Another hotel attendant is running
up.</p>
<p><strong>big close-up two maids</strong>: talking excitedly in
Italian, apparently discussing the robbery.</p>
<p><strong>another part of corridor</strong>: Camera shoots down over
the back of a waiter. He holds high over his shoulder a tray on which
are several empty dishes. A little bellboy is standing beside the
waiter, looking up and explaining in Italian excitedly what has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>staircase</strong>: TWO maids on opposite landings. Steward
comes up stairs and tells them of robbery.</p>
<p><strong>telephone room</strong>: Another operator talking
excitedly.</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: A hotel official dashes along. We hear
many voices talking at the same time. Camera pans with him up to room
253 where he stops. Door is open. Half in room, half in corridor, are
hotel attendants, detectives, the manager. With excited gestures, they
are discussing the situation in Italian. Their voices become
increasingly loud.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: to room 254. It opens quickly. Girl No. 2
appears, hair slightly disarranged. She looks annoyed and shouts in
Italian for them to keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: of room 253. The men stop talking, look
quickly over toward the girl.</p>
<p><strong>close shot girl no. 2</strong>: Indignantly and crudely, she
wants the noise to cease. She closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot at room 253</strong>: The men, talking quietly, go
into the room and close the door.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s hotel room med. shot</strong>: at door, inside.
Gaston opens it, and Lily enters quickly. Gaston closes the door, looks
at Lily questioningly. She is excited and out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh, my gracious–he almost saw me.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby.
But I don’t think he saw me. I’m positive he didn’t. Thank heaven! … But
when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of
Alconia!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: The tennis player?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What
could I do? I nodded. Baron, I shouldn’t have come!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But you came. And you must forget
everything– except that you are here, Countess.</p>
<p><strong>close shot at window</strong>: shooting from inside. Lily
comes in, stops at a chair, sits nervously, stands, moves to window, and
looks off from balcony. Gaston comes in. He touches her hand. She turns
to him.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Out there in the moonlight everything seemed
so perfect, so simple–but now–but now–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No–no.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I would like to.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You’d better not. He’s really very dull. But
anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell
the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of
Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess
doesn’t like me–but I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Why should you?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: But she talks a lot. And before this night is
over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal
gossip! … Oh!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Don’t stop. Keep right on complaining. It’s
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You know, when I first saw you, I thought you
were an American.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Someone from another world–so entirely
different. One gets so tired of one’s own class–princes and counts and
dukes and kings–ah! And everybody talking shop–always trying to sell
jewelry … And then I heard your name and found you were just one of
us.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No–proud. Very proud!</p>
<p><strong>close shot little telephone table</strong>: Gaston enters,
picks up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Hello … The countess?</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: She is still in the chair.
Frightened, she rises quickly.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Just a moment. The Duchess of Chambro.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: at the window. She is perplexed for
a moment. Then she hurries out toward the phone.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: at the phone. Lily enters. She makes a
gesture as if to say, “You see? They know already!”</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Hello, Your Grace. Yes, Your Grace. How did
you know I was here? Oh, the marquis– Yes, Your Grace. I see. Dinner
tomorrow–at your palace. Oh, I’d be delighted. King Boris will call for
me …</p>
<p><strong>second-class hotel room</strong>: It is very much in
disorder. On the night table is a phone. The woman who speaks is frowsy,
fat, common. She is apparently Lily’s companion, maid, and intimate
friend.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen, Lily. When you come home, slip up the
back way. I can’t talk now, but do what I tell you. And listen, Lily.
You know what that darn dog of yours did–?</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: at the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So, he really did! How charming! Well, my
compliments to the duke. Goodbye. There you are. The scandal is on!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot gaston</strong>: standing by the dinner table,
thoughtful. He looks over to Lily.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She has sunk into a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot gaston</strong>: looks sadly at the table,
realizing that the dinner he had pictured so charmingly may be spoiled.
He goes to Lily.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot lily</strong>: in the chair, still holding head in
hands. Gaston enters, touches her hair lightly, controls himself.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Countess, I’m sorry. If you think it’s best
for you to go–well–</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: She looks up at Gaston, amazed.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He looks at Lily with great
tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She looks tenderly at Gaston. She
rises, camera rising with her to include both Gaston and herself. She
touches his arm. She is moved and confused. Her real feeling starts to
break through at this manifestation of chivalry.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I think that’s very nice–yes, very nice. I
think–I think we should have a cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: at the dinner table. Gaston walks in,
picks up the cocktail shaker. He shakes it, smiles happily at Lily.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot fran�ois’s hotel room</strong>: Fran�ois has
recovered his memory. His hair is still disarranged, eyes still glazed.
For a few moments, he is incoherent, then he gradually becomes almost
normal. Grouped near him are five Italian hotel officials, a detective,
and the manager. They are gesturing excitedly, all talking at the same
time. The dialogue is fragmentary, ad lib, Italian. The manager, who
speaks English, turns to Fran�ois.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The representative of the police wants to
know how much money you had, M’sieu Filiba.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had
just cashed a traveler’s check and put it in my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Why did you let this man in, M’sieu
Filiba?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I
was expecting two–uh–two business associates.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: And then what happened, M’sieu Filiba?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I said, “Come in.” And there he was. A
fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, “Good
evening. I’m the doctor.” I said, “Doctor?” He said, “Yes, the doctor. I
came to see about your tonsils.”</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The representative of the police wants to
know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: <u>Niente!</u></p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: That’s just what I tried to tell him.
Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So
we talked for about ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What did you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: About tonsils.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: <u>Tonsili!</u></p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: So I said to myself, “All right, if he
wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that.” And then
he said, “Say ah.” And then I said, “Ah.” And that’s all I remember …
And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was
gone.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s hotel room med. shot</strong>: at dinner table.
Gaston and Lily are seated, eating. Waiter is pouring champagne.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Was it lots of money?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Oh, it must have been, Baron. The gentleman
occupies the Royal Suite– two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine. I
think his name is M’sieu Filiba.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You’re not safe anywhere nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: But please, Baron. We’re not supposed to
breathe a word of it. You won’t tell anybody I told you?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, Baron. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hotel corridor med. shot</strong>: at door of Gaston’s room.
The number is 300-302. Waiter comes out, closes door.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s room close shot</strong>: at dinner table. Lily
serenely continues to eat.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: That’s hotel life. In one room a man loses
his wallet and in another room a man loses– his head.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Please. When I came here it was for a little
adventure–a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But
something has changed me–and it isn’t the champagne. The whole thing is
new to me. Very new. I’ve got a confession to make to you. Baron, you
are a crook. You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven,
and nine. May I have the salt?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: The pepper, too?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You’re very welcome. Countess, believe me,
before you left this room I would have told you everything … And let me
say this with love in my heart– Countess, you are a thief. The wallet of
the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your
possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket. In
fact, you tickled me. But your embrace was so sweet …</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: at the window. Gaston enters, closes the
window, and pulls the curtains. Looking back at Lily with smiling
promise, he returns to the table.</p>
<p><strong>close shot table</strong>: Gaston goes to her, takes her
hand, and draws her to her feet. She looks at him expectantly. Gaston
takes her in his arms. It looks like the start of a passionate love
scene. Suddenly, unexpectedly, he grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her
violently.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Of their feet. Wallet falls from Lily’s
dress.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston and lily</strong>: Gaston reaches down,
picks up wallet, puts it casually in his pocket, then gracefully holds
chair, inviting her to sit.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Countess.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I like you, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I’m crazy about you. By the way, your
pin.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Thank you, Baron.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Not at all, Countess … There’s one very good
stone in it.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It was five minutes slow, but I regulated it
for you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I hope you don’t mind if I keep your
garter.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Darling! Now tell me–tell me all about
yourself. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You remember the man who walked into the
Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of
Constantinople?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Monescu!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Gaston Monescu.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Gaston!</p>
<p><strong>couch</strong>: Lily is lying on the couch, Gaston at her
side, leaning over adoringly.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I love you. I loved you the moment I saw
you. I’m mad about you. My little shoplifter! My sweet little
pickpocket! My darling!</p>
<p><strong>couch</strong>: Camera hasn’t moved but has dissolved the two
lovers out of the picture. From outside the picture we hear the switch
turned, and the light that fell on the couch goes out.</p>
<p><strong>window</strong>: A hand comes in and opens the curtains. The
moonlight streams in.</p>
<p><strong>corridor close shot</strong>: at the door of 300–302.
Gaston’s arm, in the sleeve of a dressing gown, comes out and fastens on
the hook below the number a Don’t Disturb sign, clearly printed in
several languages. He closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>corridor close shot</strong>: at the end of the corridor.
Around the corner comes our Italian group. Loudly, in Italian, they are
still discussing the robbery. Camera goes with them. In front walks the
manager, who talks back and forth. The noise increases. Suddenly the
manager looks in direction of rooms 300–302.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: We see Don’t Disturb sign.</p>
<p><strong>close shot another part of the corridor</strong>: Manager,
having seen the sign, turns to the others with a loud “Shh!” They quiet
down.</p>
<p><strong>corridor long shot</strong>: of door to 300–302. The Italians
are passing door very quietly. Suddenly the detective wants to say
something. We tremble for Gaston and Lily. Manager again with “Shh!”
Detective is silenced. Entire group goes quietly out of picture. We stay
a few moments on the empty scene. Camera moves up to Don’t Disturb
sign.</p>
<p><strong>close shot grand canal</strong>: Camera moves with the
garbage gondola. It is filled to overflowing. The garbage gondolier has
done a good evening’s work. He is paddling with a flourish and singing
an operatic aria.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: MINIATURE OF PARIS Shooting over the roofs
and presenting a beautiful view. The camera pans back away from Paris
and in the foreground we see factory chimneys, so that we get the
impression we are moving into the factory district of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>big factory whistle</strong>: It is blowing loudly.</p>
<p><strong>big gate</strong>: of the factory. Above gate, in large
letters: Colet et Compagnie, Paris. Gate opens. Hundreds of workers, men
and women, come out. They are hatless; it is lunch hour.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Geneva … From Geneva comes the news that
the world-famous international crook, Gaston Monescu, robbed the peace
conference yesterday. He took practically everything, except the peace.
The police arrested him and confiscated all the stolen goods, but he
managed to escape in an unexplainable manner. This is the Paris police
reporter speaking.</p>
<p><strong>second announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, this program
comes to you through the courtesy of Colet and Company, manufacturers of
the most famous perfumes in the world. Remember–it doesn’t matter what
you say; it doesn’t matter how you look; it’s how you smell. Thank you.
“Colet, Colet, Colet and Compa-<u>ny</u>”</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Colet et Compagnie sign in front of
retail establishment. Song continues.</p>
<p><strong>second announcer voice</strong>: “are makers”</p>
<p><strong>voice continues</strong>: “of the”</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “<u>best</u> perfume.”</p>
<p><strong>second announcer</strong>: “If you and your beloved can’t
agree,”</p>
<p><strong>neon sign</strong>: showing man spraying sleeping woman with
perfume atomizer. Woman wakes up and stretches.</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “permit us to sug-<u>gest</u>
perfume.”</p>
<p><strong>second announcer</strong>: “Cleopatra was a lovely
tantalizer. But she did it with her little atomizer.”</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Girl spraying herself with atomizer
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “We’ll make you smell like”</p>
<p><strong>another girl</strong>: applying perfume with glass
applicator.</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “a rose; every”</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: Large factory complex, camera
advancing.</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “nose in Paris knows”</p>
<p><strong>long shot</strong>: Factory gates with sign, Colet et Cie.
Hordes of workers pouring out.</p>
<p><strong>song continues</strong>: “Colet and Compagnie.”</p>
<p><strong>directors’ room</strong>: of Colet et Cie. Camera is moving
over a long table. We see only the forward half of the
table–serious-looking businessmen. Camera stops at the head in front of
M. Giron, chairman of the board, a distinguished elderly man. He is
addressing someone at the unseen other end.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I’m sure, Madame Colet, if your husband were
alive, the first thing he would do in times like these–cut salaries.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette colet</strong>: in a beautiful light
morning dress at the other end of the table.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Unfortunately, M’sieu Giron, business
bores me to distraction– and besides I have a luncheon engagement. So I
think we’d better leave the salaries just where they are. Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Goodbye, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Goodbye, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>jewelry store, very ultra close-up</strong>: at counter. We
see some expensive-looking small purses, compacts, laid out on velvet.
Behind counter, an elegant clerk is talking to Mme. Colet, who is out of
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: This one, Madame Colet, is only three
thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: Side of counter, now in a
beautiful afternoon gown.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Oh, no. That’s entirely too much … How
about that one?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: That’s sixteen hundred and fifty</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Sixteen hundred and fifty! That’s
outrageous!</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Here’s one for nine hundred.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Hmm … not bad … How about <u>that</u>
one?</p>
<p><strong>close-up jeweler</strong>: He looks down inside the showcase,
reaches in, takes out a beautiful handbag, much larger. It is studded
with diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Oh, this one … Madame–well, that’s a
hundred and twenty-five thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But it’s beautiful. I’ll take it!</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Thank you, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>street in paris close shot</strong>: at door to shop of a
fashionable furrier. We hear, from outside the picture, the purr of a
motor and the sound of brakes as a car comes to a stop. Proprietor opens
door from inside, comes toward camera, beaming, bows in the direction of
the unseen car.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: How do you do, Madame Colet?</p>
<p><strong>[same shot</strong>: But now the proprietor has seen her out.
Sound of car starting and going.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Goodbye, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: at door in office building, shooting
from corridor into a nondescript little waiting room. Door is open so
that we can’t see sign on it. In doorway stands a fat little Turk with a
pointed black beard. He bows repeatedly to someone behind camera.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Goodbye, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>fine residence street med. shot</strong>: in front of
Mariette’s house. Mariette’s very expensive car, shooting from house to
car. At open car door stands footman, looks toward entrance of the
house, bows.</p>
<p><strong>staircase mariette’s house int.</strong>: shooting from
stairs down to hall against entrance door. In foreground, the lower part
of staircase. In background, the elaborately furnished hall. Butler
stands at foot of staircase, looking up.</p>
<p><strong>upper part of staircase</strong>: Camera shoots up. On
landing at head of stairs, the maid. Background, expensive upper hall.
Maid looks at Mariette, who is apparently halfway down staircase.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful garden</strong>: Background, glimpse of hothouse.
Foreground, near flower bed, the gardener.</p>
<p><strong>drawing room close shot</strong>: At fireplace stands
Fran�ois Filiba, back to camera; we don’t recognize him.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: No, no, no, no, Fran�ois! I tell
you no!</p>
<p><strong>armchair</strong>: Mariette, in a precious armchair by
fireplace. We see reflection of the fire. She is in beautiful evening
gown. At her side, on a little table, a glass of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You see, Fran�ois, marriage is a beautiful
mistake which two people make together. But with you, Fran�ois– I really
think it <u>would</u> be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>fireplace</strong>: Fran�ois, still with back to camera. He
stiffens at this rejection. He turns, affronted, faces Mariette. Now we
discover he is Fran�ois, the man who had trouble with his tonsils in
Venice.</p>
<p><strong>golf course close-up</strong>: of the major, a man about
forty-five, in smart golf togs. He looks dejected.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Don’t be so downhearted, Major.
You’re not the only one I don’t love.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: on golf course, also in smart
sport clothes. She is getting set to swing at the ball and is more
concerned with her golf form than with what she is saying.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I don’t love Fran�ois, either.</p>
<p><strong>staircase in mariette’s home</strong>: Maid comes down, leans
over railing, addresses someone behind camera.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Madame will be ready in two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sofa in front hall</strong>: Fran�ois and Major, seated. Both
in full evening dress– overcoats on, top hats on knees, opera sticks in
hands. Expressions serious as they nod to maid, then lean back without
looking at each other.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I know you don’t like me, Major. And to be
perfectly frank, I dislike you intensely. But since we have to be in
each other’s company this evening, we might as well make conversation.
Well, Major, what’s your answer? For heaven’s sake, man, say
something!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Tonsils.</p>
<p><strong>opera house close shot</strong>: Part of the orchestra;
shooting on an angle down, so that we photograph part of the orchestra
and a portion of the footlights without the singers. We hear the
orchestral music and the singers’ voices.</p>
<p><strong>opera box</strong>: Door opens. Mariette and Major come in.
Mariette looks annoyed. She sits. Major sits.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Door to box, from interior. Door opens.
Fran�ois appears. He is very angry. The argument with the major
apparently reached its peak before they came into the opera house and at
the last moment he refused to accompany them.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Mariette and Major. Major paid no
attention to Fran�ois. But Mariette, more annoyed than before, looks
toward door, then back to Major.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two
men of your standing, always quarreling.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: He started it.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But you’re the more intelligent one.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Then why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Because I hate him–because I love you!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You should have more self-control. You
were in the army.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Well, he was in the navy.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: It opens again. Fran�ois appears
again.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I want you to go out and apologize –right
away!</p>
<p><strong>opera corridor close shot</strong>: at to box. Fran�ois is in
a chair by the door, opera hat and overcoat still on. Door opens and
Major comes out. Fran�ois gets up. They glare each other.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: See here, my good man. You’ve been saying
goodbye for the last half hour, and staying on. I wish you would say how
do you do, and go!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot box</strong>: Mariette, listening to the music.
Suddenly door opens. She turns as Major comes in and sits beside her.
She looks at him questioningly.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Well, he left. I tell you, apologizing is a
gift!</p>
<p><strong>orchestra seats close-up</strong>: of Gaston. He is looking
through opera glasses up at Mariette’s box. Camera is so close to the
opera glasses that we can’t see Gaston’s face. We see his hand adjusting
the opera glasses.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s box</strong>: Gaston’s viewpoint, photographed
through an opera-glass vignette. We see Major and Mariette. Camera stops
in front of the railing. We see Mariette’s hand holding the handbag.
Camera centers the handbag. We hold this, then camera pans up to
Mariette’s face. She is looking at the stage. Camera pans quickly down
again to handbag. We stay on the handbag. Major’s hand comes in and
touches Mariette’s hand caressingly. She brushes his hand aside. Camera
moves quickly up to Major. He is looking ardently at Mariette. He leans
over to her. Camera with him. Both in the picture. A dialogue scene now
follows, but even though it is a close-up, we can’t hear them because
they are through binoculars from a distance. In this inaudible but
visually expressive scene, Major tells her he can’t understand her
attitude toward him. She impatiently asks him to leave her alone to
enjoy the opera opera. Major persistently says he loves her. Mariette
insists that he stop it. She takes out of her lap opera glasses and
holds them to her eyes. Major gives up, leans back in chair. Camera
centers Mariette, alone. Then camera, still framed in opera-glass
vignette, pans down and comes to rest on handbag, now lying on the
railing unprotected.</p>
<p><strong>close-up conductor</strong>: from viewpoint of the stage. He
is looking up at the singers. Then he looks down to his score.</p>
<p><strong>score close-up</strong>: from viewpoint of the conductor. It
is the first act, at about page twenty. We hear the soprano singing.</p>
<p><strong>soprano’s voice</strong>: I love you, I love you, I love
you!</p>
<p><strong>chorus’s voices</strong>: She loves him, she loves him, she
loves him!</p>
<p><strong>close-up score</strong>: at about page ninety; at least one
act has been played. We hear same soprano singing–but a different tune
in a different key.</p>
<p><strong>soprano’s voice</strong>: I hate you, I hate you, I hate
you!</p>
<p><strong>chorus’s voices</strong>: She hates him, she hates him, she
hates him!</p>
<p><strong>corridor med. shot opera house</strong>: toward the sumptuous
down-staircase. We see, in corridor, at opposite sides of staircase,
doors to ladies’ and men’s restrooms. Door to the ladies’ restroom is in
foreground. A gentleman is pacing up and down. Door opens; a lady comes
quickly to the gentleman. They exchange a few words, which we don’t
hear. Gentleman reaches in pocket, gives her a coin. Lady goes back
quickly. As she is about to enter restroom Mariette comes out, excited,
rushes past gentleman down corridor and out of picture.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s box</strong>: Major sits alone. The music comes in
full volume. Mariette enters, looks at her chair, at railing, at Major.
During the following, both search around in the box.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: My bag!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Your bag?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, my bag!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Didn’t you take it with you?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Apparently not. Don’t you know where it
is?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: No–I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But you saw it here.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Yes, I saw it–but–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Well, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>close-up conductor</strong>: disturbed by the agitated
sounds, looks up at Mariette’s box, sternly reproving.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Mariette and Major are standing, searching.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: It couldn’t have walked out by itself!</p>
<p><strong>gallery</strong>: Two typical music lovers. One is bent
forward, eyes fixed on the stage. The other leans back, eyes closed in
ecstasy. First man, suddenly annoyed by sounds from the box, says,
“Psst!” Second man suddenly wakes up, looks angrily at first man, says,
“Shh!” The two glare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: outside Mariette’s box. Door opens.
Mariette and Major come out, shut door. Major is carrying hat and coat.
They are still searching, looking everywhere. Camera moves with them as
they go down the corridor. Mariette goes into ladies’ room. Major
automatically follows her; door closes behind them. An instant later,
Major scurries out. Followed by camera, he hurries away, embarrassed,
stops, turns.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: at door to ladies’ restroom. The maid, a
middle-aged woman, looks grimly at Major.</p>
<p><strong>close-up major</strong>: He doesn’t know what to say or how
to act. At this moment the music stops. We hear the bursting final
applause.</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: Doors to first balcony open, and many
people hurry out. We still hear applause.</p>
<p><strong>stairway and corridor outside boxes</strong>: On either side,
a door to a restroom. At top of stairway stands Major. People emerging
from boxes. Mariette comes out of ladies’ room, goes to Major. We see by
her gestures she hasn’t found her bag. More people pass from behind
camera. Mariette and Major are caught in the crowd and disappear.</p>
<p><strong>stairway same camera angle</strong>: Last patrons leaving
down the stairs. They disappear; corridor and staircase are empty. Door
of men’s room opens; out comes a lone figure, Gaston. Immaculate in
evening dress, top hat, overcoat, and stick, he strolls toward the
stairs and starts down.</p>
<p><strong>jewelry store</strong>: Shooting from inside store through
window toward street. In front of window appears Major. He looks, sour
and depressed, at the window display. Camera moves with him as he enters
shop and goes to counter. Camera pulls back, and now we discover
Fran�ois at the counter. Both look straight ahead; they don’t see each
other yet. Clerk enters.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, m’sieu?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: I would like to have–</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Good morning, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Good morning. I’d-I’d-I’d like to look at
some cuff links.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Very well, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Nice day, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Umm.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: You’re looking fine, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Now see here, my good man. I’ve had just
about enough of your insulting remarks!</p>
<p><strong>close shot sign</strong>: on cheap hotel in suburb of Paris,
shooting up from street. Sign reads Paris-Astor Hotel. Camera pans down.
In entrance doorway, the bellboy–on his cap: Paris-Astor Hotel– shabbily
dressed, leaning lazily against door, bag of cherries in hand. He eats
and spits the stones into street with a minimum of energy.</p>
<p><strong>close shot couch in cheap hotel room</strong>: Lily, in
negligee, lying on couch, face covered by newspaper she is reading while
she has breakfast, which is on a little table beside her. The dishes are
clean but cheap looking. Lily lowers the paper and looks slyly up. She
sees:</p>
<p><strong>other side of room close shot</strong>: Gaston, in dressing
gown, sitting in armchair, reading a newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She watches Gaston, looks down to
table, back at Gaston. She wants to put something over without being
seen– something important. Now, quick, she decides to do it, come what
may. She picks up a French roll–still watching him– dunks it in the
coffee, takes a hurried bite, and disappears again behind paper.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t agree with this review at all. I
thought Martini’s singing was adequate, but to call him a great
singer–ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: Still reading her paper.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I always liked him. Especially last year in
Munich …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Last year? It can’t be that long.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Yes! Don’t you remember the day you took that
Chinese vase from the Royal Palace and made it into a lamp for my night
table?</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He looks at her with emotion, gets
up, and goes to her.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot lily</strong>: Gaston sits close to her, caresses
her hair.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I remember the lamp, I remember the night
table, and I remember the night. Everything will be all right again.
Prosperity is just around the corner!</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston’s chair</strong>: Gaston returns, sits, picks
up paper, resumes reading.</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: at her paper. Suddenly she stares at
something on the page. She leaps to her feet.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Gaston!</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He looks up.</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: Paper in hand, followed by camera,
she goes to the bureau, opens a drawer, and takes out Mariette’s
handbag. She looks at the bag, rereads the item in the paper, looks back
again.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: Puzzled, he gets up.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: Followed by camera, she hastens to
Gaston, hands him the paper, points to the item.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Read this.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: A large classified ad with headline: Handbag
Lost–Twenty Thousand Francs Reward. Before we can read the rest, camera
moves close to the headline. Under the insert, we hear:</p>
<p><strong>lily’s voice</strong>: The description fits. That’s our
bag!</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily and gaston</strong>: Gaston has finished
reading.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Twenty thousand francs … If we sold it we’d
get– Well, it’s worth forty thousand at the most. She paid probably
sixty thousand. When we sell it … I’d say five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Darling, then let’s be honest and return it to
the lady.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And take the twenty thousand francs …</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Sweetheart, what day is today?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: The fourteenth of May.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day
after tomorrow–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: The six–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We’ll go to Venice, to the same hotel!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: We’ll take the Royal Suite!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Two fifty-three, five–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Seven and nine!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And we’ll celebrate the second anniversary
of the day we didn’t get married!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Porter comes in, carrying a pair of
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Your shoes, Professor Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s living room med. shot</strong>: Mariette and an
elderly woman who has seen better days. Her clothes, once elegant, now
are shabby. She is unwrapping a package as camera moves toward both to a
close shot. She takes out a handbag which also seen better days, holds
it toward Mariette pathetically. Mariette responds with a kindly
look.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No, I’m sorry, but that’s not the bag.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know it isn’t. But it’s pretty– isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>close shot telephone table</strong>: Mariette enters, picks
up phone.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Hello … Yes .. . Where did you find the
bag? Where? Where? What? What was in it? How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>close shot elderly woman</strong>: bag in hand, with patient
hope.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: at phone. Her expression
softens. Followed by camera, she goes to woman.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You wouldn’t have any use for it? You see, I
have another bag, and I really don’t need this. So, if you’d like to buy
it …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Would two hundred francs be
sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes, madame.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, thank you, madame!</p>
<p><strong>close shot telephone</strong>: Mariette enters edgily.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Hello … Yes …</p>
<p><strong>armchair</strong>: Bag falls on armchair into an assortment
of several other bags. Mariette must have been buying bags for
hours.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: What? Yes, this is Madame
Colet.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: at the phone</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What? Yes, I lost my bag. Yes. Last night
at the opera … No, no, I don’t want to buy a piano!</p>
<p><strong>long shot hall</strong>: Shooting from the direction of the
living room toward the house entrance door. Hall is filled with men and
women, some well dressed, some shabby. Some carry packages. Several
women hold, each, two “found” bags. One woman carries a crying baby.
Butler’s voice comes behind the camera.</p>
<p><strong>butler’s voice</strong>: Next, please.</p>
<p><strong>living room med. shot</strong>: at open door. Bolshevik
enters, followed by butler, who shuts door behind them as Bolshevik goes
to Mariette. During all this, we hear:</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: No … No, it was <u>not</u>
insured. But right now it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What? I may lose it again? But I haven’t
found it yet! I’m sorry. Goodbye! Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: So you lost a handbag, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: And it had diamonds in the back.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: And diamonds in the front.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: Diamonds all over.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Well, have you found it?</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: No! But let me tell you–any woman who
spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag–phooey, phooey,
phooey!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I must ask you</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: And as Trotsky said– “Any woman who
spends a fortune for a silk purse is a sow’s ear.” And that goes for
you, too!</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: to hall. While Bolshevik is
ranting, it opens; Gaston enters briskly with an authoritative air,
shuts door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>mariette, bolshevik, and butler</strong>: Mariette is
startled; she doesn’t know who or what the gentleman is. Bolshevik is
frightened. Butler is momentarily nonplussed.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: He steps forward
commandingly.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot mariette and bolshevik</strong>: Gaston goes to
Bolshevik, puts his arm patronizingly on his shoulder, and tells him
politely but emphatically, in Russian, to leave. Bolshevik makes a
protesting remark. Gaston tells him vigorously and effectively to scram.
Cowed, the Bolshevik goes.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Butler, recuperated and full of
dignity, opens door to the hall. Bolshevik appears, turns to Mariette
and Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>bolshevik</strong>: Phooey! Phooey! And– Phooey!</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Mariette and Gaston. Mariette is more
bewildered by Gaston than by the Bolshevik.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: His phooey is worse than his bite. I must
apologize for entering unannounced. If I am not mistaken, Madame
Colet?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Will you be good enough to look at this bag,
madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: That’s it! Yes, that’s it! … Jacques!</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: It opens and butler enters.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Dismiss all the people in the hall. The
bag has been found.</p>
<p><strong>butler’s voice</strong>: Very well, madame.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: And Jacques. Call up the major and tell
him– No, don’t call him. Let him keep on searching! And Jacques–
Sorry–the bag’s been found. And Jacques–</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Call Cohen, Cohen, Ginsburg, and Renault.
Give my thanks to M’sieu Renault. Thank them all!</p>
<p><strong>butler’s voice</strong>: Very well, madame.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Where did you–</p>
<p><strong>close shot another part of the room</strong>: A beautiful
Chinese vase on a table. Gaston, looking at vase with appraising eye, is
absorbed, unaware that Mariette has addressed him.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: She goes toward Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: still studying the vase. Mariette
appears. He turns to her.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Where did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You know the main staircase in the
opera?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then you go to the left. There’s a
landing.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then you go into the foyer.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And as you leave the foyer, there is a
little niche.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I know that niche.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And in that niche, there is a statue of
Venus.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You like that statue?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Neither do I. That’s where I found it.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I don’t know how I could have lost it
there. I was nowhere near that niche.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Oh … That’s strange. Maybe–are you sure this
is your bag?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Of course it is! Are you doubting me?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Not in the least, madame. But you see, it’s
a very expensive bag–one has to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Well–I am Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And I am M’sieu Laval–if you will allow me
to introduce myself.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Well–how do you do, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: The pleasure is mine, madame.</p>
<p><strong>street in paris</strong>: Fran�ois, package under arm,
walking. It is apparent that he has purchased the handbag.</p>
<p><strong>living room close shot</strong>: at table. Gaston has just
opened the bag.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: One purse– empty. One vanity case–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But really, m’sieu, this isn’t
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing
things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette
lighter, one box of real matches, and– Oh, yes, this letter from
Major–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Oh! You didn’t read it!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Naturally I did.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You needn’t be embarrassed, madame. A lady
as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: M’sieu Laval!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I
don’t mind his grammatical mistakes. I’ll overlook his bad punctuation.
But the letter has no mystery–no bouquet–no … And one lipstick … Scarlet
number four.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What’s wrong now?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: With your skin, I prefer crimson.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Too much blue in crimson.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: That’s what you need!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No, no, no! I disagree with you
completely! I tried it once–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: What shade of powder do you use?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Peaches and cream.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: That’s too dark.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Do you realize I have light eyes?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But, Madame Colet, that’s a matter of eye
shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>close-up door</strong>: Butler comes in, shuts door quickly
behind him.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: The major.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston and mariette</strong>: On couch. She makes
a gesture of exasperation. So does Gaston. They look at each other
helplessly. Then Gaston takes charge. He rises and goes toward
butler.</p>
<p><strong>hall med. shot</strong>: at living room door. Major stands
waiting. Door opens; butler comes out, followed briskly by Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I’m sorry, m’sieu, but Madame had better not
see anyone.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You see, the bag has just been found, and
the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a
little too much for her. It’s not very serious, but just the same we’d
better not take any chances.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Just as you say, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Thank you, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Good day, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good day, Major.</p>
<p><strong>street</strong>: in front of Mariette’s house. Fran�ois,
followed by camera, goes to the door, rings bell. Door is opened by
butler, and Major comes out, butler remaining in doorway. Major and
Fran�ois stare at each other. Major looks pointedly at Fran�ois’s
package. Then Major turns to butler.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Jacques, has the bag been found?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Is Madame feeling well?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: No, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Is Madame seeing anybody this afternoon, this
evening, or even tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: No, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: You may shut the door, Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Well. that leaves you holding the bag.
Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>living room couch close shot</strong>: Gaston and Mariette.
There is a moment of silence.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, I think I’d better be going. Goodbye,
Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Goodbye, M’sieu La– Oh, yes … This is a
rather delicate matter and I don’t want to … You see, if you read my
advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: In other words, madame, it embarrasses you
to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Don’t be embarrassed, madame. I’ll take it.
I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole
matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash … To make a
long story short–a member of the nouveaux poor.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Then I’m glad I lost the bag! I’ll write
you the check immediately.</p>
<p><strong>hall med. shot</strong>: at staircase. Coming from living
room, Mariette goes up the stairs, followed by camera. At first landing,
as Mariette reaches door–</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Madame Colet!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>gaston below</strong>: Shooting down from her angle.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Do you know my first name?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No. What is it? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: Followed by camera, he runs up
stairs. At the landing, he goes close to her.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Gaston!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And do you know what I’d like to have you do
with that check?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Make it out to cash!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: As you like.</p>
<p><strong>long shot private office of former secretary, with
glimpse</strong>: INTO ADJOINING ELEGANT BEDROOM In foreground at desk,
is Mariette. In bedroom background, Gaston is seen examining a painting
on the wall with the air of a connoisseur. Camera moves to close-up of
Mariette. She is opening and shutting drawers.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now, where can that checkbook be? Oh, dear
me, dear me! She must have left it somewhere. It’s always the same–when
you’re looking for something, you can’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: at the wall, still admiring the
painting. Now he draws painting slightly away from wall and glances
behind as if looking for a safe. He allows painting to drop back into
place. Followed by camera, he goes on looking around. He stops before
window, looks out, studying possible entrances and exits.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: at desk, still searching.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I can’t find that checkbook. I should have
discharged her six months ago! I really don’t know what to do. Where can
I look now? M’sieu Laval, I’m very sorry, but–</p>
<p><strong>door to former secretary’s bedroom</strong>: It is open.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: Followed by camera, she goes to
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom med. shot</strong>: at open door. Mariette enters,
stops.</p>
<p><strong>close shot bed</strong>: Gaston is studying bed with the eye
of a connoisseur.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: in doorway. She looks
mystified. She moves toward him lightly because:</p>
<p><strong>close shot bed</strong>: Gaston apparently doesn’t know she
is in the room. He is still studying bed with scholarly concentration.
Mariette enters, stops beside him.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Eighteenth century.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Early eighteenth century. I should say
around–seventeen thirty.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Beautiful specimen.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little
tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: This used to be my secretary’s room.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I see. She must have been very happy
here.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Too happy. That’s why I discharged
her.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Isn’t that wonderful! You see, madame–</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: In the wall is a safe. Camera moves to
close-up of safe.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Let me tell you something, madame, as a man
who has had all kinds of secretaries … I wonder if she put that
checkbook in the safe!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I hardly think so. But let’s look.</p>
<p><strong>close shot safe</strong>: Mariette enters, starts turning
knob, lips moving silently as she articulates numbers to herself. The
camera pans her out and stops before Gaston who is now close behind her,
concentrating on the combination.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette’s hand</strong>: turning knob back and
forth.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston’s hand</strong>: It is instinctively
turning an imaginary knob, following Mariette’s pattern.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette and gaston</strong>: Mariette opens safe.
Gaston takes a swift good look into safe, but acts casual in case
Mariette turns around.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No, no. No, it’s not here. Oh! What do you
think of that? A hundred thousand francs! You know, I didn’t have the
slightest idea–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand
francs–in your safe–at <u>home</u>?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You think that’s too much?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No! Not enough! In times like these, when
everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a
substantial part of his fortune within arm’s reach.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: That sounds sensible.</p>
<p><strong>close shot little settee</strong>: Mariette enters, sits.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Very sensible!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Madame Colet, I think you deserve a
scolding. First, you lose your bag–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Then I mislay my checkbook–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then you use the wrong lipstick–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: And how I handle my <u>money</u>!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It’s disgraceful!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Tell me, M’sieu Laval, what else is
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Everything! … Madame Colet, if I were your
father– which, fortunately, I am not–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Ye-es?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And you made any attempt to handle your own
business affairs, I would give you a good spanking–in a business way, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What would you do if you were my
<u>secretary</u>?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: The same thing.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You’re hired!</p>
<p><strong>board of directors room</strong>: Camera moves along the
table in close shots of members of the board. An excited murmur runs
along the table. Camera stops in front of M. Giron, the chairman, who is
talking to the man beside him. Now he turns to opposite end of table,
rises.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Speaking for the board of directors as well
as myself, if you insist, in times like these, on cutting the fees of
the board of directors, then we resign.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: at opposite end. He gets up with
an air of authority.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Speaking for Madame Colet as well as
myself–resign!</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Very well! We’ll think it over, M’sieu
Laval!</p>
<p><strong>insurance office close shot</strong>: of insurance agent at
his desk. He is looking over Mme. Colet’s policies.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Now, M’sieu Laval, as for Madame Colet’s life
insurance, it totals one million francs. There is five hundred thousand
fire insurance and four hundred thousand against burglary.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: in a different suit. He begins to
calculate with his fingers and murmurs figures.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then we’d better increase the burglary
insurance to eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Thank you, M’sieu Laval!</p>
<p><strong>close-up cook</strong>: in the kitchen. Big, fat, motherly
looking.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: No potatoes, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: In still another suit. He is
standing, looking stern.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No potatoes!</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Yes, M’sieu Laval.</p>
<p><strong>close-up butler</strong>: in hall.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: No, M’sieu Laval!</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: A fluffy, pretty little maid in Gaston’s
bedroom, holding a duster.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Maybe, M’sieu Laval!</p>
<p><strong>gymnasium close shot</strong>: of Mariette’s feet and legs in
gymnasium outfit, shooting down on an angle. Feet rise and camera
follows movement arc-wise, comes to rest on Mariette’s face.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Is this what you mean, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: erect in sweater, arms
folded.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Absolutely, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>corridor close shot</strong>: Gaston in doorway to his
office. Evening; lights are on. He wears a dark business suit.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Now, M’sieu Laval, please!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Frankly, madame, I’m too tired.</p>
<p><strong>upper staircase</strong>: from Gaston’s viewpoint. Mariette,
in evening dress, is near landing. From downstairs, the music of a tango
and laughter of guests.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Don’t you want to come down and join the
party? Just a little tango –no? Oh, you with your messy old papers and
contracts and money-money -money–all those uninteresting things!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: They’re very interesting to <u>me</u>,
madame. And <u>somebody</u> in this house should worry about money. No,
madame, really, I have to be up early in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>office close shot next morning</strong>: of Gaston at window,
walking up and down dictating, followed by camera. We hear click of a
typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: New paragraph. Furthermore, it is Madame’s
wish–</p>
<p><strong>close shot secretary</strong>: Typing away at an appropriate
desk is none other than our Lily. She is demure in a little blouse and
skirt.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: –that while half of the interest
shall be deposited as usual in Madame’s account–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: –the other half, contrary to custom, shall
be delivered in cash into Madame’s personal custody. Darling, that means
that on the second of June we’ll have eight hundred and fifty thousand
francs.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we’re
broke–all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times
like <u>these</u> when we’re doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>–why
take a chance on jewelry?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I know you’re awfully busy, and I don’t like
to trouble you. But she has <u>one</u> <u>little</u> <u>necklace</u>–you
know, that one with the seed pearls? It’s so <u>quiet</u> and
<u>simple</u>. It would go just beautifully with my neck.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>door</strong>: Butler enters.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: M’sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to
Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Very well, Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s bedroom close shot</strong>: Mariette in bed.
Breakfast table. She is reading a magazine. Knock on door.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>door close shot</strong>: Lily enters. She is now wearing
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Good morning, madame.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Good morning, mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She approaches Mariette.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: in bed. Lily enters.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You’ve had your breakfast–oh, but of
course you have.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very
early. My little brother goes to school– You see, Mother is dead.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, that’s the trouble with mothers.
First you get to like them and then they die.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: of a diamond ring on floor by bed.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She looks at ring with undisguised
desire for an instant. Then she reaches for it.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Lily’s hand lifts ring from floor.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette and lily</strong>: Seeing that she has
been observed, Lily hands ring to Mariette.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>night table</strong>: A little jewel box, open. The ring
falls in.</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: She looks toward the jewel box with
regret, fingers itching. She pulls herself together and sits on her
hands.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette and lily</strong>: Mariette is just about
to reach for the cream. Lily, quick and polite, takes the cream pitcher
and pours for Mariette.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Thank you! … Now, mademoiselle, the reason
I asked you to come–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Two lumps, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Please! Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: She lifts cup, sips coffee. She
looks over at Lily.</p>
<p><strong>close-up lily</strong>: Looking downward modestly.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: She watches Lily a moment to make
sure she is not looking. Then she dunks a roll in the coffee and takes a
quick bite.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now, Mademoiselle Gautier–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Yes, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You see– Oh, not a word to M’sieu
Laval!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Potatoes. He doesn’t want me to eat them–
and naturally I don’t want to upset him.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Naturally not!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now. Uh–mademoiselle–in the short time you
have been M’sieu Laval’s secretary, have you noticed any change in
him?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Well–uh–yes and no.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: To me he seems rather nervous.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Nervous? Um-hum. He smokes too much!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No, he <u>works</u> too much. He’s chained
to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his
work–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So he wouldn’t be confined so much to his
office–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes! And he would have a little more time
for–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: For all the really important things–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I’ll do my best, madame, even if I have to
work every night.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That’s
ridiculous. You go home as usual–five o’clock every day. Now I’m going
to be a little bit of a tyrant–I insist. It’ll be nice for your little
brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o’clock</u>–remember!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Very well, madame. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Lily opens door.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: And, my dear–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Yes, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: How much is your salary?</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Three hundred francs.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Well, in times like these most people are
cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and
fifty?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh, madame, you’re just too sweet for
words!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot office</strong>: close to door. Gaston is pacing up
and down. Lily enters, quickly closes door behind her. She takes off her
glasses. She is seething.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, what does she want?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You! And she’s willing to pay as high as fifty
francs!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: But it’s not enough!</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s bedroom close shot</strong>: Mariette, still in
bed, talking into phone.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now, Fran�ois, don’t be silly. I have
nothing against you … Oh, no, that’s all forgotten … What? … Not this
week, Fran�ois … Business, Fran�ois, business!</p>
<p><strong>office med. shot</strong>: which during the scene moves to a
closer shot of Gaston and Lily. As we pick them up both are pacing up
and down at the height of unpleasantness.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You’re talking like a child. You know
exactly what we’re here for and what it’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: <u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u>
<u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Did you ever take a good look at her–uh–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Certainly!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: They’re all right, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you
something: so far as I’m concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that
safe!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Gaston. Let’s open it–right now! Let’s get
away from here! I don’t like this place!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Oh, no, darling. There’s <u>more</u> sex
appeal coming on the first of the month. It’s only ten days … Eight
hundred and fifty thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Darling, remember you’re Gaston Monescu.
You’re a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship
you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob–but don’t become one of those
useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!</p>
<p><strong>office close shot</strong>: of clock on desk. It is 5 P.M. We
hear five chimes. Against this shot of clock:</p>
<p><strong>lily’s voice</strong>: Good night, Gaston darling.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Good night, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>lily’s voice</strong>: Well, I leave you alone with that
lady–but if you behave like a gentleman– I’ll break your neck! Goodbye,
darling!</p>
<p><strong>close-up same clock, same angle</strong>: It reads 5:12. We
hear a knock at the door.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Oh, M’sieu Laval …</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Yes, Madame Colet?</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Yes–uh–</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Oh, that’s too bad. You see, I
wanted her to do something. Well, I guess I’ll have to do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: What is it, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: I wanted to ask her to ask you if
you’d be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>close-up same clock</strong>: Five past nine. Light is
different, room being almost in darkness. We hear phone ring several
times. Nobody answers.</p>
<p><strong>close-up same clock</strong>: Ten to eleven. So dark that we
can barely see the hands. From outside, faint voices. We hear door open,
and a bar of light falls across clock.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Good night, Madame Colet. And let me
tell you again–you dance like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Oh, no, it’s the way you lead.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: No, madame, it’s the way you
<u>follow</u>.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: No, m’sieu!</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s voice</strong>: Yes, madame!</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: Well, the evening is still young.
Let’s go down to the living room and talk it over. It’s only ten
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>living room close-up</strong>: of a different, more
decorative clock on mantel. Hands stand at eleven. As clock strikes
eleven, with dainty, rapid chimes, pan along one side, following mantel,
until clock is out of picture, and we see two half-empty champagne
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>close shot window</strong>: Open window frames a view of
garden. Foreground is dark. Above trees, a church steeple with a clock
large enough so that we can read the time. It is twelve. As we hear, in
splendid tones and a slower rhythm, the tolling of midnight, pan over to
the side. Steeple is out of picture and full moon comes in.</p>
<p><strong>hall upper end of stairs</strong>: Close shot of hall clock
near Mariette’s bedroom door. Hands indicate the hour of two, and deep
tones strike the hour. Apparently there is only a dim light. Camera pans
to door of Mariette’s bedroom. In half-open doorway stands Mariette,
evening dress, looking toward office door, eyes languorous.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Good night, M’sieu Laval.</p>
<p><strong>close shot office door</strong>: In half-open doorway stands
Gaston, white tie and tails.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good night, Madame Colet.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot hall</strong>: At one end, at her open bedroom
door, is Mariette. At other end, as we have seen, is Gaston. They look
at each other for a vibrant moment.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: A large window, consisting of four or
five framed units, fronts on a terraced garden in which a small informal
party is underway.</p>
<p><strong>camera moves</strong>: back along window with them. As soon
as the two young ladies are out of the picture, Mariette brings Gaston
intimately close toward window and camera. Charmingly and with a twinkle
in her eye, she reprimands him, in a guarded whisper, about flirting. He
answers and apparently says something that makes her laugh, disarming
her. With a sudden return to party manner, she moves with him along the
framed windows. Camera goes with them as she introduces him to a few
little groups. By this time, they are back in the first window frame,
and now they move out of picture.</p>
<p><strong>camera continues</strong>: past window and discloses inside
corner of living room. In a chair, sitting stiffly as if in a waiting
room, is M. Giron, the chairman of the board, briefcase on knees, flower
in buttonhole. He seems in a bad mood–apparently the financial cut
hasn’t agreed with him. We hear a door opening.</p>
<p><strong>butler’s voice</strong>: M’sieu Giron, Madame will be with
you presently.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Very well, Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>terrace close shot</strong>: at window shooting into living
room. Giron comes toward window and looks into garden. His face gets
stern and angry as he sees:</p>
<p><strong>garden close shot</strong>: Giron’s view, of Gaston and the
major, animatedly conversing. Camera angle must be so that Gaston is
more prominent, thus giving impression that Giron’s attention is focused
on Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No, no, my dear Major. There’s a limit to
what you can do with infantry. If have you the proper artillery backing,
I would say– maybe.</p>
<p><strong>terrace close shot</strong>: toward window. Behind window
stands Giron, muttering imprecations under his breath.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely.
That’s the trouble with you artillery men.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Now just a minute, Major–</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: No, Captain, I tell you–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now, Major, you mustn’t monopolize M’sieu
Laval. Please! May I present M’sieu Laval? Madame Chotard, Madame
Leconte, Madame Poncelet. Madame Rudaux, M’sieu Legrand– M’sieu Laval.
M’sieu Laval–Madame Boucher. M’sieu Filiba. M’sieu Laval–Madame
Jeantaud, M’sieu Gentil.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: That’s that M’sieu Laval.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Laval? Who is M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Oh? … So!</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: And <u>he</u> says he is her secretary. Maybe
I’m wrong–maybe he <u>is</u> her secretary.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: Mariette has apparently left the
last group, and he remains. The others, at the moment, are busy with tea
and cakes; no one talks. Gaston, back to camera, steals another look
over his shoulder at Fran�ois.</p>
<p><strong>close shot fran�ois</strong>: from Gaston’s viewpoint. He is
staring at this new and dubious figure in Mariette’s life–Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: with the group. He sees that
Fran�ois is staring at him, becomes a little uncomfortable. With sudden
decision, he turns to the group.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Excuse me, please.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Pardon me, m’sieu, but I have the feeling we
have met somewhere before.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I’m sorry, but I don’t seem to recall the
occasion. No, I’m afraid …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well–then it must be my mistake. I beg your
pardon.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: That man never met me, and he knows it.
Trying to make social connections!</p>
<p><strong>living room mariette and giron</strong>: On a table is a pile
of business papers and an empty briefcase. Giron has fountain pen in his
hand, ready to turn it over to Mariette for signature.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But my dear M’sieu Giron, I’m having a tea
party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I’m sorry, madame, but there are still
certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I,
personally, would not care to refer them to–to–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: To M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Madame Colet, I’ve enjoyed the confidence of
your family for more than forty years. I was a school friend of your
husband’s …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Madame, let me ask you: Who is M’sieu Laval,
anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: He is my secretary! I hope that answers
all your questions, M’sieu Giron.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: You know what Paris is saying about the
Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Jacques!</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: It opens; butler enters.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Yes, madame?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Ask M’sieu Laval if he will be good enough
to come in.</p>
<p><strong>butler’s voice</strong>: Very well, madame.</p>
<p><strong>garden close shot</strong>: of lady and Fran�ois at a table.
Fran�ois is very fidgety.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Now, please. Please calm yourself!</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I’m like that–I can’t help it! I
<u>know</u> I never met that man, and yet– Laval, Laval … You know, if I
<u>like</u> a man, I remember him. And if I <u>don’t</u> like a man, I
never <u>forget</u> him. In a nutshell, madame, it’s little things like
that that drive me crazy! Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: in garden. He is about to join
another group when Fran�ois stops him.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: M’sieu Laval …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Yes, M’sieu Filiba?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: You see– No, no! And <u>yet</u>–
<u>Did</u> I–did–now <u>where</u> could we have–</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Pardon me, m’sieu. Madame Colet would like
to see you in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: At once, Jacques. We’ll continue later.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Now see here, my good man, let’s face the
facts. I’m having a dinner party, and one man turned me down at the last
minute. Have you a dinner jacket?</p>
<p><strong>med. shot living room</strong>: Giron and Mariette. The
situation is tense. Gaston enters.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Madame.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Will you be good enough to run through
these papers with M’sieu Giron?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I’ll be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: And so will M’sieu Giron.</p>
<p><strong>living room door</strong>: Mariette goes out.</p>
<p><strong>close shot giron and gaston</strong>: For a moment the men
eye each other. Gaston smiles, but Giron maintains a frigid face. Gaston
calmly takes the papers, sits, and starts to go over the figures.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: M’sieu Laval, there are several things I’ve
wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from
Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Um-hum …</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: You must be related to the Lavals of
Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I hope you find the figures correct.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I hope so, too.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: M’sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence
of this family–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: For more than forty years. So Madame told
me.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for
more than thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: Deaf to Giron, concentrating on
figures, he turns absently to the window and suddenly comes awake, for
he sees:</p>
<p><strong>close shot window</strong>: Gaston’s viewpoint. Outside
window, on terrace, stands Fran�ois. He is staring at Gaston as if to
say, “<u>Where</u> did I see him?”</p>
<p><strong>big close-up gaston</strong>: He smiles cordially at
Fran�ois.</p>
<p><strong>close shot fran�ois</strong>: through window. He begins to
smile, then shakes head as if saying, “No, that’s not the fellow.” He
goes out of the picture.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston and giron</strong>: Gaston still smiling
toward window. Now he turns back to the papers and begins muttering more
figures.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: M’sieu Laval, you seem to be avoiding my
questions.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And you, M’sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing
my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Examination! M’sieu Laval, what are you
insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than
forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame’s confidence? Three weeks,
I believe.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Two weeks and three days.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Um-hum!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M’sieu
Giron?</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: No, not at all!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, that’s fine. Then you are not
insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that
you won’t let me examine this report.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I was only asking if you are related to the
Lavals of Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And I was only asking you if you would let
me examine your report without interruption.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I don’t see why any man should get excited
when he is asked about his hometown.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And I don’t see any reason for any man
getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Are you insinuating that this is not an
honest report?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I am only insinuating that you are
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Nervous! Why should I be nervous?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t <u>know</u>, M’sieu Giron!</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Are you trying to say that there is anything
in these figures to make me nervous?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We’ll keep these papers here. And tomorrow
morning I’ll drop in at your office, and I’ll tell you all about the
Lavals of Marseilles. And there won’t be any tea party to interrupt
us!</p>
<p><strong>garden close shot</strong>: at a table. On table is an
ashtray. Fran�ois is sitting by table, an unlighted cigarette in his
hand, very thoughtful, still trying to place Gaston. He puts cigarette
in his mouth, takes a match from ashtray, which is equipped with
matchbox. He lights cigarette and suddenly looks at ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>close shot ashtray</strong>: It is made in the shape of a
gondola.</p>
<p><strong>close-up fran�ois</strong>: staring at the gondola. We see
that his mind is grappling, trying to connect gondola, Venice, and
Gaston. He rises, brain working.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot door in entrance hall</strong>: In the half-open
doorway stands Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Goodbye, M’sieu Giron!</p>
<p><strong>long shot stairway</strong>: Gaston runs quickly up.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot office</strong>: at the door. Gaston opens door,
enters, closes it quickly with great excitement.</p>
<p><strong>close shot desk</strong>: Lily is typing. She is startled at
Gaston’s sudden entrance and gets up.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: at door. Followed by camera, he
goes to Lily.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Do you know who is here? Come in!</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Butler opens.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: M’sieu Laval, M’sieu Filiba would like very
much to see you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: In a moment.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Filiba …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Yes–Filiba! Venice–Grand Hotel– room two
fifty-three–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Five, seven, and nine–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Yes! Now don’t worry!</p>
<p><strong>long shot stairway</strong>: Gaston comes quickly down, goes
out toward entrance door.</p>
<p><strong>entrance hall close shot</strong>: of Fran�ois, waiting, hat
in hand, ready to leave. Gaston enters.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I wanted to say goodbye to you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Goodbye, M’sieu Filiba.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: But before I say goodbye I want to ask you
one question: Have you ever been in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: You’ve <u>never</u> been in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No … Have <u>you</u> ever been in
Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Amsterdam?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Constantinople?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You’ve never been in Constantinople?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Let me tell you, Venice <u>can’t</u>
<u>compare</u> with Constantinople.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: But–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t care <u>what</u> you say! In
Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas–</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: And harems … ?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Well–Con-stan-ti-<u>nople</u>!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: at foot of staircase. He bows
smilingly to Fran�ois.</p>
<p><strong>close shot doorway</strong>: Fran�ois looks searchingly at
Gaston for a long moment, then turns and departs, still puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot gaston</strong>: Once door is shut, there is a
swift change on his face. He turns and dashes upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>office close shot</strong>: at door. Gaston enters and,
followed by camera, goes swiftly to desk, past Lily, who stands fearful
and ready for action, straight to the phone.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: �ys�e seven, eight, nine, two. We have to
clear out. Railroad station? Ticket office, please.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: He recognized you!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No–not yet–but– Two tickets to Berlin–first
class and sleeper–night train … Right … Right … Leave them in the name
of–Don Ignacio Fernandez … Right … Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Spanish passports?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Correct. Now the train leaves–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: At twelve twenty. I know. Lyons two, four,
seven, one. Two more days and we’d have seven hundred and fifty thousand
francs more!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, we’ll have to take what’s here. A bird
in hand is worth two in jail.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Hello … Is this the Spanish consulate? This is
Do�a Ignacio Fernandez. My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin
… Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon … ? Thank you, thank you.
How long will it take you?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t know. Fortunately, she has a dinner
engagement tonight. I’ll meet you at the station–midnight. Hello … Yes?
What? … You found a handbag? Well, you’re three weeks too late!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Well, see you at the Berlin Express.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: By the way, how is your German?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Marchand two, nine, one, one … Hello … Is
this the Petit Flower Shop? This is Don Ignacio Fernandez. I’d like you
to take five dozen roses–deep red roses–and I’d like you to put them in
a basket and send the basket tomorrow morning to Madame Mariette Colet.
<u>The</u> Madame Colet … Yes … You have the address? … Good! And attach
a card: “In memory of the late M’sieu Laval” . . Tomorrow morning–ten
o’clock .. . Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dining room major’s apartment</strong>: Table is for

downstairs, she stops. Followed by camera, she goes to office door,
knocks. Door opens, and Gaston appears.</p>

<p><strong>mariette</strong>: What are you going to do with my day
tomorrow, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, we’ll have breakfast in the

<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Are you staying out late?</p>

Mariette. She looks at him with eagerness, thinking he has amorous
designs.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He sees she misunderstood, is a
little embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>staircase</strong>: Close-up of Mariette. She misinterprets
his embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He cannot tell the truth and is so
truly smitten that he hates to lead her on.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: convinced he is shyly in love
with her and needs assistance.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Why do you ask, M’sieu Laval?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Do I have to answer?</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: Her lips form the inaudible
whispered answer.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: in doorway. He bows, returns into
office; door shuts.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: Looks after him an instant,
then, followed by camera, goes slowly downstairs, very happy; her love
affair is coming to a head. She stops. On impulse, she turns and,
followed by camera, goes quickly up stairs to his office and enters,
closing door behind her.</p>

<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Madame has changed her mind. She’ll be down
in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Very well, m’sieu!</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette and gaston</strong>: in office. Gaston
has just closed door.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But I told you I don’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But you have an engagement, and I don’t want
people to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Talk? About me–about us?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Afraid I’m ruining your reputation, M’sieu
Laval?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No–yours, madame.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: M’sieu Laval, I’ve got a confession to
make to you …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You like me. In fact, you’re crazy about
me. Otherwise, you wouldn’t worry about my reputation. Isn’t that
so?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But incidentally, let me tell you,
<u>I</u> don’t like <u>you</u>. I don’t like you at all! I wouldn’t
hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation–like that!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You would?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, I would!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Like that?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Like that!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I know all your tricks.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: And you’re going to fall for them.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: So you think you can get me?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Any minute I want!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You’re conceited–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But attractive–</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston’s telephone</strong>: It rings several
times. No one answers.</p>
<p><strong>lower hall telephone close shot</strong>: It is ringing–a
different tone from the one we have just heard. Butler enters and
answers.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Hello … Well, I’ll try him again. Yes, he’s
in his office, but he’s busy … Madame Colet? She’s still here–yes … But
she’s busy, too … Well, I’ll ring again.</p>
<p><strong>landing on upper staircase med. shot</strong>: office door.
Telephone still ringing inside. Nobody seems to answer.</p>
<p><strong>lily’s hotel room close shot</strong>: Lily at phone, putting

she had been humming so gaily before. Now it comes in fragments as she
moves about, sits, gets up. She is worried and suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot upper staircase</strong>: Hall clock is striking
eight. Butler comes up stairs, goes to office door, and knocks. To his
multiple confusion, behind him <u>Mariette’s</u> door opens and
<u>Gaston</u> appears.</p>

<p><strong>close shot butler</strong>: He turns to Gaston’s new
location.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: M’sieu Giron is downstairs.</p>

Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.</p>

<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I <u>must</u> go.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I’m crazy about you!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I <u>believe</u> you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then why do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Because I want to make it tough for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: We have a long time ahead …</p>
<p><strong>close-up a mirror in the room</strong>: The couple are seen
at one angle, as dialogue continues.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Weeks …</p>
<p><strong>close-up another mirror</strong>: Another angle on the couple
as she says:</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: months …</p>
<p><strong>med. close shot on the empty bed</strong>: Their embracing
shadows lie the length of the bed, giving the effect of two bodies in a
sex embrace on the bed, as she says:</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: years! …</p>
<p><strong>close shot both still embracing</strong>: She continues:</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Think of that, Gaston–the future lies
bright before us!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Eleven o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: A man in love, completely shaken.
He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: �lys�e seven, eight, seven, nine.</p>
<p><strong>lily’s hotel room</strong>: The luggage is packed and in
order. Followed by camera, Lily, dressed for travel, paces nervously up
and down. Phone rings. She rushes to phone.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Hello … Darling! Oh, darling, it’s good to
hear your voice! I thought you’d <u>never</u> call! I <u>tried</u> to
get you … What? <u>What</u>? <u>Tomorrow</u> <u>morning</u>? <u>Why</u>?
Of course … Um-hum … Um-hum … That sounds reasonable–very
reasonable…</p>
<p><strong>living room major’s home close-up</strong>: of Mariette. It
is after dinner. We hear voices and music. Her thoughts are with Gaston.
She sips from a champagne glass. Medium close-up to include her chair
and a small table. She puts glass on the table and, oblivious to other
guests, leans back dreamily, anticipating a night of love, eyes
closed.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: No doubt about it–it’s that secretary.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Funny, the kind of men women fall for.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: No color, no sparkle–but dependable.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: The type they marry.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: You know, I’m not the marrying type. I like
to take my fun and leave it.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Like it?</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Smart. London, eh?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: He’s really not a bad fellow.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Just dull.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Insignificant … He’s a secretary, always
<u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Funny–the first time I saw him I thought he
was a doctor!</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: Doc–!</p>
<p><strong>very close shot gaston’s bedroom window</strong>: from
outside. Behind the glass, Gaston’s hand drumming on the pane nervously.
Camera pulls back, and we see Gaston looking into the night, waiting
restlessly. Suddenly he turns around sharply toward the door. Apparently
someone has knocked at the office door. Camera swings over to the next
window, and we recognize the office, which adjoins Gaston’s bedroom.
Through office window we see butler, who has knocked on bedroom door,
waiting. Bedroom door opens, and Gaston emerges It is apparent that
butler delivers a message. Camera moves down one floor and stops in a
close shot of living room window from outside. Behind the glass stands
Giron. He also drums nervously on the pane.</p>
<p><strong>living room close shot</strong>: at door to the corridor.
Door opens. Gaston enters.</p>
<p><strong>close shot giron</strong>: He turns. Gaston comes into
picture.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I’m very sorry, but this is no time, M’sieu
Giron–</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I’ve got to see you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But not now.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Right now! It’s very important, M’sieu
Laval.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It may be important to you, M’sieu
Giron–</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: No, to you–M’sieu <u>Monescu</u>.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Won’t you sit down?</p>

followed by Major and Fran�ois. All are excited.</p>
<p><strong>major and fran�ois</strong>: But, Mariette, <u>please</u>…
Now <u>listen</u>–it’s <u>true</u> …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: It’s absolutely ridiculous! I don’t
believe it!</p>
<p><strong>major and fran�ois</strong>: But, Mariette–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I’m awfully tired anyhow. So please leave
me alone. Good night! I had a very lovely time!</p>
<p><strong>long shot</strong>: Shooting toward the car from opposite
side. View of house and Major and Fran�ois is covered by car. Car pulls
away. We see Major and Fran�ois moving toward house, chummy, animatedly
talking.</p>
<p><strong>fran�ois</strong>: So I said to myself, “All right, if he
wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that.” And then
<u>he</u> said, “Say <u>ah</u>!” And that’s all I remember …</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s living room med. shot</strong>: Gaston and Giron

<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Very well, m’sieu.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Otherwise I’ll call the police</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Yes, m’sieu. M’sieu Giron!</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You have enjoyed the confidence of this
family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about– about
sixty-five. Let’s see– You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come
out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You say I am a crook.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: I know it!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then why didn’t you call the police? Why
<u>don’t</u> you call the police? I’ll tell you why–you crook, you.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: M’sieu …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Monescu.</p>

the doorway, is a smiling host.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good night, Adolph!</p>

is about to enter his office, when outer doorbell rings. Exasperated, he
hastens down.</p>

There stands Giron, furious.</p>
<p><strong>giron</strong>: Don’t you dare to call me Adolph!</p>
<p><strong>stairway</strong>: Gaston starts up.</p>
<p><strong>long shot her bedroom int.</strong>: It is dark. Door opens.
Gaston enters, shuts door, turns on wall switch, flooding room with
light. He moves to a night table by the bed, on which is a small lamp,
turns on the lamp, then goes back to wall switch and turns off main
lights. Room is now in soft shadow, with only the small light. He turns
to window, sees that shade is not down, goes toward the window.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: of same window from outside. Gaston
appears, is just about to pull down shade when he glances toward his own
bedroom in other wing of house. He sees:</p>
<p><strong>camera pans quickly</strong>: to other wing of house and
stops outside Gaston’s bedroom window. Behind window stands Lily looking
across at him. The situation is clear; she knows the worst. She looks
menacingly calm.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s bedroom window</strong>: from outside. Gaston is
in trouble and he knows it. He goes quickly toward door.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s bedroom window</strong>: from outside. Lily, having
seen Gaston leave Mariette’s room, pauses, makes up her mind, then draws
the curtains closed.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s bedroom inside close shot</strong>: at door. It
opens. Gaston rushes in, looks toward window, doesn’t see Lily, turns,
and sees:</p>
<p><strong>close shot lily</strong>: at the wall safe. She has one hand
on the dial and is facing Gaston defiantly.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: Followed by camera, he goes to
Lily.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Are you insane? You’ve to get out of here at
once! She may come back any minute.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What time is your rendezvous?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Now, Lily–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Yes, <u>M’sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You <u>have</u> to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: That’s what I’m here for–to get out! I want to
get away from here, from you–as fast as I can and as far as a hundred
thousand francs will take me. Sixty-five, ninety-four–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Don’t you <u>realize</u>–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Thirty-five to the left–sixty- three, eight …
I wouldn’t fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth …
Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five– What has she got that I haven’t
got?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Lily, you must listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Shut up! Don’t make up any stories!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But, Lily–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Don’t you dare lie to me! I know you love me.
Well, why don’t you say something? Come on–be brilliant. Talk yourself
out of it–bluff yourself in! Shut up, you liar, you! That’s what I want!
This is real! Money! Cash!</p>
<p><strong>street</strong>: in front of Mariette’s house. Her car comes,
stops.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot hall</strong>: Gaston’s door. Lily comes out, very
excited, closing door behind her. Followed by camera, she runs down
steps, across hall, toward entrance door. Doorbell rings. She stops.</p>
<p><strong>butler’s pantry</strong>: Butler in a chair, half-asleep.
Bell rings again. He gets up and goes out.</p>
<p><strong>hall med. shot</strong>: at entrance door. Lily has
disappeared. Butler comes, opens door. Mariette enters.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Good evening, madame.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot mariette’s bedroom door</strong>: from hall. Gaston
opens the door. He sees Mariette, smiles, and opens her door very wide,
welcoming her to her own room.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: at Gaston’s door to his
office-and-bedroom suite. She smiles at him enigmatically. Instead of
responding, she opens his door and goes in, leaving door open. As she
goes she gives him another smile, as if to say, “This is where it’s
going to be.”</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: puzzled, but not worried. He
closes her door and goes toward his own door.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s bedroom</strong>: Mariette stands in the center of
the room. Gaston enters, closes door, goes toward her. Camera moves to
close shot of both. She embraces him–they kiss. Then, languorously, she
takes off her wrap. He helps her. She drops wrap on bed. Then she
reaches for her necklace with the seductive air of a woman about to
disrobe. She takes off the necklace, the jeweled pin on her bosom, then
her bracelets and rings.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: When a lady takes her jewels off in a
gentleman’s room, where does she put them?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: On the night table.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But I don’t want to be a lady.</p>
<p><strong>close shot safe</strong>: Mariette enters with the intention
of opening the safe.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He is startled. He goes quickly
toward her.</p>
<p><strong>close shot safe</strong>: Mariette is about to turn the dial.
Gaston enters.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Ah, let me have a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>close shot armchair</strong>: Gaston enters, sits on the arm
of the chair, and leans back, smiling, on guard.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Now let me see–sixty-five,
ninety-four–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Thirty-three–</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No–thirty-five!</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: He laughs, too. They are apparently
having a jolly time.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: She continues to dial.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Thirty-five … You know, Fran�ois–M’sieu
Filiba– thinks you’re a very remarkable man.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: For one swift instant his face
tells us that now he knows the worst.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s voice</strong>: He was at the dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Sixty-three, eight–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Mariette!</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: She turns toward him
charmingly.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, Gaston?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: What would you say if you found your safe
had been robbed?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I wouldn’t say anything–I would act.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Call the police?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Instantly.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Um-<u>hum</u> …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But why talk about robbery on a night like
this?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Thank you. Seventy-six, eighty–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Mariette!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Yes, Gaston?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You have been robbed–for years. And not a
hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it?
Adolph.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Adolph J. Giron.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: And you expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Naturally not. But I expect the police to
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>close shot night table</strong>: Gaston enters, picks up
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: at the safe. Frightened, she
goes quickly to telephone.</p>
<p><strong>close shot telephone</strong>: Mariette enters, takes
receiver out of Gaston’s hand, sets it back.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Why not? He’s a thief–he’s a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Then why are you afraid to let me prove
it?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Giron…!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet
and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans’ Asylum. Adolph J.
Giron–distinguished citizen! … Well, shall I call the police? I see! You
have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man
starts at the bottom and works his way up–a self-made crook –then you
say, “Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!”</p>
<p><strong>close shot safe</strong>: Gaston enters, gives the dial one
turn, and safe opens. The papers inside are in complete disorder.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: staring at the open safe.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: He goes toward her.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: Gaston enters, bows
formally.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I don’t seem to have my calling cards with
me, Madame Colet. So permit me to introduce myself informally–Gaston
Monescu. I assure you in my own circles I am very well known.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: You wanted a hundred thousand francs, and
I thought you wanted me.</p>
<p><strong>close shot window</strong>: Curtains are now open. We see the
church steeple–the same one we saw romantically before. Mariette enters
and leans her head against the window, her back to the camera. The
church clock strikes eleven.</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: He is crushed. Followed by
camera, he goes to her, stops at her side.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: I came here to rob you–but unfortunately I
fell in love with you. Mariette!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Why did you take the money?</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Mariette’s bedroom window from outside.
Behind the window is Lily, looking across at him implacably. She has
witnessed the scene at the opened safe and has come to her own
conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>gaston’s bedroom window</strong>: from outside. Close-up of
Gaston. He looks at Lily, dumbfounded.</p>
<p><strong>mariette’s bedroom close shot</strong>: at door to corridor,
from inside. Mariette enters. Suddenly she turns, and she too is
dumbfounded, because she sees:</p>
<p><strong>close shot window</strong>: from Mariette’s viewpoint. Lily
is still looking out at Gaston, her back to Mariette. She hears the door
close, turns, sees Mariette, takes in the situation at a glance, and
goes, proudly direct, toward her.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: Lily enters. They face each
other.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Madame, the only thing that seems to stand
between you and romance is a hundred thousand francs. Well, he didn’t
take it. I took it–all by myself. Now you can have your romance!</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I think you’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Ever had a romance with a crook?</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: I beg your pardon!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Let me give you a little advice. When you
embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your
fingerprints were found …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Mademoiselle Gautier–or whatever your name
is–I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You’ve got
your money–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I don’t want your money!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot all three</strong>: as Gaston appears. He stops
inside the door. Both women turn.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You wanted to buy him for fifty francs. Well,
you can have him for nothing!</p>
<p><strong>close shot bed</strong>: The money falls on bed.</p>
<p><strong>close shot group</strong>: Lily walks toward Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: And you–</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Lily–</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice
a hundred thousand francs for her. Well– she’s worth it!</p>
<p><strong>close shot bed</strong>: Lily enters, takes the money she had
gallantly relinquished.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette and gaston</strong>: standing like two
guilty schoolchildren. Lily comes into picture, walks past them to door,
opens door, turns.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Goodbye–Madame Colet and Company!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Lily!</p>
<p><strong>med. shot door</strong>: Outside we hear the slowly returning
footsteps of Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: sitting up on bed. She turns
toward door with hope.</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Gaston enters, closes door, and
moves toward Mariette. He looks very grave.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: sitting on bed. Gaston goes to
her. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It could have been marvelous …</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Divine …</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Wonderful … But tomorrow morning, if you
should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and
there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with
a warrant–then you’ll be glad you’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: But it could have been glorious.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Divine … But that terrible policeman!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Goodbye …</p>
<p><strong>close shot door</strong>: Gaston opens door, turns to
her.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You know what you’re missing?</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: She shuts her eyes and dreamily
nods.</p>
<p><strong>close-up gaston</strong>: in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No … <u>That’s</u> what you’re missing! …
Your gift to her.</p>
<p><strong>close-up mariette</strong>: For an instant she is taken
aback; then she smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: With the compliments of Colet and
Company!</p>
<p><strong>close shot gaston</strong>: He bows, goes. Door shuts behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>close shot mariette</strong>: She looks after the departed
Gaston a moment. Her mood is broken by ringing of telephone.</p>
<p><strong>mariette</strong>: Hello … Yes … What? … Yes … No, no. Thank
you very much, but the handbag has been found exactly two weeks and
three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxicab moving at night along paris streets</strong>:
Close shot of Gaston and Lily. There is a strained silence between them.
Gaston smiles toward her. He is trying to make up, but she sits frozen.
He smiles again, anticipating the surprise he has in store for her. He
reaches for the pearls in his pocket. A look of dismay crosses his face–
the pearls are not there! He looks in all his pockets, can’t find them.
Suddenly, with suspicion, he looks sidelong at Lily. She responds to his
look with a triumphant smile. From her bosom she brings forth the string
of pearls and holds it up. He is amazed, can’t figure it out. She
reaches behind and brings forth a handbag, which we recognize as the one
originally stolen from Mariette, and she drops the pearls into the bag.
Gaston is now smiling with admiration, yet he looks sly. As Lily drops
in the pearls she glances into the bag. Her expression changes.
Something is missing. She looks suspiciously toward Gaston.
Nonchalantly, he draws, from his inside breast pocket, the precious bank
notes, and slips them too into the bag. They smile at each other.
Together forever, they embrace and kiss.</p>
