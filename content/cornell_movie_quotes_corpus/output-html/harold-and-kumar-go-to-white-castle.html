<p><strong>man</strong>: Billy Boy!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Get your ass ready! It’s almost five o’clock
and this bad boy needs to get his drink on!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Oh God. Give me that. I’m burning it once and
for all.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Dude, it’s been six months. You have to move
on.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You know what’ll cheer you up? Some hot chick
riding your jock all night long.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re such a romantic, J.D.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: It would help get your mind off of Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
women, I wouldn’t even know what to do. I’ve been out of the game so
long.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I
promise you’ll get laid.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sounds tempting, but I can’t. Berenson needs
me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign
investors.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: So what? It’s Friday! You have all weekend to
do that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No I don’t. The Germans are taking an earlier
flight back, so the meeting’s been moved to tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, why don’t you just get somebody else to
do your work then?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>2 int. harold’s cubicle - 4:55 pm 2</strong>: HAROLD LEE is
packing up his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day. BILLY and
J.D. approach…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Harold, listen, I need you to update these
models for me.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But aren’t you supposed to…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know, but something came up. I have to meet
with some clients tonight, so I won’t be able to get to it. It’s your
responsibility now. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: And make sure it’s in tomorrow by nine o’clock
sharp.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 3.</strong>: J.D.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uh…okay…no problem…</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. office building parking lot - 5:00 pm 3</strong>:
BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Wow! I can’t believe how easy that was!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done?
I’m telling you – those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably
just made his weekend.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. j.d.’s convertible 4</strong>: Billy and J.D. enter
the car.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Now get ready. It’s time we embark
on…Operation Get Some!</p>
<p><strong>5 int/ext. j.d’s convertable 5</strong>: Billy and J.D. think
they’re hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their
tunes. When the lyrics kick in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately.
Billy loves it. When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their
seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner. J.D. gives
a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his car zooms out of the
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. dr. woodruff’s office - nyu medical school 7</strong>:
KUMAR PATEL is answering questions from his NYU Medical School
interviewer, DR. Woodruff . Kumar has NO ACCENT. He’s American.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused
by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands,
sluggishness and loss of appetite.</p>
<p><strong>dr. woodruff</strong>: Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you’re
one of the best applicants I’ve ever interviewed. Not that it’s a
surprise. Your father is very respected in his field. You know he and I
had some pretty wild times when we were in med school.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dr. woodruff</strong>: Yeah. We started our own basketball
team– the Hemoglobin Trotters… Yeah, we were crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. woodruff</strong>: Anyway– just one more question. What
are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Let’s see. There might be epigastric
tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m sorry. Can you hold on one second?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Kumar’s phone. Kumar speaking. Oh, hey.
Nothing important. I can talk. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>int. harold’s cubicle - simultaneous</strong>: Harold is
talking on his office phone…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m not gonna be able to partake in our
usual Friday night ritual. I’ve gotta stay late at the office.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fuck that shit! We had plans!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I know, but I gotta get this work done.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh come on! When has getting high ever
prevented you from finishing your work?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Listen, I’d love to go home, but…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of
the finest herb in New York City, and I’m not smoking it alone.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 6.</strong>: KUMAR</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of
pancreatitis. Um…decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration,
and sometimes even shock.</p>
<p><strong>dr. woodruff</strong>: Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
proper interview. Do you actually believe after the way you’ve behaved
that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No. I’d actually be pretty surprised.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Look, I’m just interviewing so my dad will
keep paying for my apartment. I’m not really planning on going to med
school.</p>
<p><strong>dr. woodruff</strong>: But…you have perfect MCAT scores!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, I’m not an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Wow! Is this your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>8 int. harold’s cubicle 8</strong>: Harold shuts down his
laptop. He then puts the laptop along with all his paperwork into a bag
and leaves the office.</p>
<p><strong>9 ext. office building parking lot 9</strong>: Harold walks
to the end of the parking lot, where his car is parked. As he walks, the
strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground. Harold is
frustrated as he picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. parking lot exit gate 10</strong>: After other cars
zoom through uninterrupted, the ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT stops Harold
and checks his ID before letting him leave.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. apartment building parking lot - 6:21 pm 11</strong>:
Harold’s driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes! Right in front…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Those assholes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: This is America, dude! Learn how to drive!</p>
<p><strong>extreme sports punk #1</strong>: Better ruck tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>11a ext. semi-urban street 11a</strong>: He ends up parking
far from the building. He has to parallel park. He’s anal with his
parking, going in and out a bunch of times, until the car is positioned
perfectly in the spot.</p>
<p><strong>11b ext. harold and kumar’s apartment building 11b</strong>:
Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up
the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building… Suddenly, he stops in
his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees… MARIA– A beautiful,
sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She’s standing by the
elevators. HAROLD can’t move. He’s mesmerized. This is his dream girl.
Harold takes a deep breath…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Okay, be yourself. Don’t be nervous.</p>
<p><strong>11c int. apartment building - day 11c</strong>: Harold enters
the building and walks over to Maria. They give each other a friendly
smile. We hear a “BING” sound, indicating the elevator has arrived. The
doors open and Harold and Maria walk inside.</p>
<p><strong>12 int. elevator 12</strong>: HAROLD and MARIA are standing
silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to
speak…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So Maria, what’s been going on?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, nothing. It’s just been a long week. How
about you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: My week was great. Work wasn’t too bad. I
caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to
bathe for a change.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that.
Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like
crap. But a man can dream, right?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So what are you up to tonight?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Actually, I’m probably gonna work out a
little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend’s
place. He’s cooking me a really nice dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that.
I’ll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and
watch Blind Date.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That sounds awful.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, if you want some company, maybe you
could sit on your ass at my place.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. apartment building 13</strong>: We’re back in the
lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A FANTASY. Harold and Maria
enter the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>14 int. elevator 14</strong>: HAROLD and MARIA stand silently
while the elevator goes up. It’s clear Harold wants to say something,
but he doesn’t have the courage. They reach their floor and exit the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>16 int. harold and kumar’s apartment - 6:30 pm 16</strong>:
Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place is
minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of “BILLY
MADISON.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah, I’m in here!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: In here…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar, what the hell are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m trimming my pubes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why aren’t you doing this in your room!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: The mirror’s in here. Hey, check it out! It
looks like a Bonsai tree!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m gonna puke. Get your clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger.
Besides, if I don’t do this, I’ll end up with pubes like my dad. You’ve
seen Osama Bin Laden’s beard, right?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Are those my scissors? Oh my God! I trim my
nose hair with those!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, I’ve been cutting my ass hair with them
for the past six months.</p>
<p><strong>get the hell out of my room!</strong>: Kumar puts the
scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold shakes his head and sets up his
laptop on his desk…</p>
<p><strong>16a int. kumar’s bedroom 16a</strong>: Kumar puts on some
boxers and a T-shirt .</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So what the hell is your problem, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Other than my roommate’s boney ass?</p>
<p><strong>17 int. harold’s bedroom 17</strong>: Harold turns on his
laptop and is ready to start working.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: One of the senior analysts asked me to do a
bunch of his work for him tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I assume you gave him the appropriate “go
fuck yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If by “go fuck yourself” you mean “no
problem sir” then yes, he got the message loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say “no” once in a while. Now lets
get high.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I got a lot of work to finish.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fuck that! You’ll have plenty of time to get
that shit done later. Come on, let’s smoke a couple joints.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: One joint.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: One and a half. Now let’s do this…</p>
<p><strong>18 int. living room 18</strong>: Kumar walks over to a table
in the living room where he finds AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar
lifts open the cover– inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with
marijuana. Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy. The phone next to
the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn’t care. He lets it ring until the
answering machine picks up.</p>
<p><strong>man with thick indian accent</strong>: Kumar…it is daddy. I
hope your interview today was good. I’m calling to remind you that you
have another one tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from Cornell at 10:00
a.m. Do not be late!</p>
<p><strong>man with thick indian accent</strong>: It is very important
you show up on time! Mommy and I will be very upset if you do not go.
Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the meeting is at ten o’clock. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t you think you should take at least one
of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad’s gonna get really
pissed.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So what? It’s not like there’s a shortage of
Dr. Patel’s out there. My dad’s a doctor. My brother’s a doctor. Just
because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn’t mean I have
to.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, then what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna
smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. living room - 7:00 pm 20</strong>: HAROLD takes the
first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar, as if to say “that’s good
shit.” Kumar takes the blunt from Harold and inhales…</p>
<p><strong>21 int. living room - 7:30 pm 21</strong>: Harold and Kumar
are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG, while watching TV. The room is
filled with smoke.</p>
<p><strong>angle - television</strong>: It’s an episode of “The Router
Workshop.”</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I think we’ve already seen this one.</p>
<p><strong>angle - television</strong>: It’s an anti-marijuana
commercial. Two teenagers are listening to rock music in a house without
parents. One teenager passes a joint to the other .</p>
<p><strong>blonde haired kid</strong>: Come on, dude. Just take one hit.
Don’t you want to be cool?</p>
<p><strong>blonde haired kid</strong>: Hey man, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brown haired kid</strong>: I’m so high! Nothing can hurt
me!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Marijuana kills.</p>
<p><strong>angle - harold and kumar</strong>: They’re laughing their
asses off at the commercial.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I love that shit!</p>
<p><strong>angle- tv</strong>: We see a News report</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Tonight…a Cheetah escaped from the
Morristown Zoo…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Nice. Sixteen Candles is on.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: And the award for least heterosexual
statement ever made in this apartment goes to…</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 15.</strong>:
KUMAR</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh come on. It’s a John Hughes movie! It’s a
classic! It’s a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed,
unappreciated, unloved…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey look! It’s you!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, when are you gonna start doing some
chores around here?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’re so high right now.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re not low.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I’m hungry as
balls.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No shit! Let’s eat!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Nah, I don’t feel like delivery tonight.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What about KFC?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Nah, we’ve been there too many times. I want
something we haven’t had in awhile. Something different. Something
that’ll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food…</p>
<p><strong>voice on tv</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>voice on tv</strong>: Then come to White Castle and try our
Slyder Special– six burgers, fries, and a soft drink for only 2.99.</p>
<p><strong>voice on tv</strong>: Imagine all those burgers in your
stomach right now. Mmmmmh….</p>
<p><strong>voice on tv</strong>: Don’t you like food that’s tasty and
delicious?</p>
<p><strong>voice on tv</strong>: Then what are you waiting for? Head
over to White Castle. It’s what you crave.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. hallway outside apartment - 7:45 22</strong>: HAROLD
and KUMAR exit their apartment.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re sure you know how to get there? I
haven’t been to White Castle in ages.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m telling you, there’s one right around the
corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. rosenberg and goldstein’s apartment 23</strong>:
HAROLD and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to
theirs.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rosenberg, Goldstein– get up. We’re going to
White Castle.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Wait– we’re watching The Gift on HBO.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No waiting. We’re starving…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: …Put that down! We’re not eating `til we get
to White Castle.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Now come on guys, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Sorry man! We’re not going anywhere.
Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Is that all you Jews ever think about?
Tits?</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: We’re talking about Katie Holmes here.
You would never think a sweet, innocent girl like her would ever take
her top off. Which is precisely why we have to watch her do it.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Dude, the things I’d eat out of her ass,
you have no idea. Bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you name it…</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: That’s a very vulgar statement.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: So is “I want to pound Britney Spears in
the pussy.” But it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Touch�. Anyway, if you guys want to wait
till the movie’s over…</p>
<p><strong>24 int. by the elevator - 7:50 pm 24</strong>: HAROLD presses
the “down” button. KUMAR notices that Harold has his LAPTOP BAG on his
shoulder…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What the hell are you bringing that for?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re driving. I’m gonna try to get some of
my work done in the car.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shit, I forgot my cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why don’t you just run back and get it?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Nah, we’ve gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. elevator 25</strong>: As Harold and Kumar enter, we
hear a DOOR SLAM behind them. They turn around and see MARIA locking her
door. She hasn’t noticed Harold and Kumar yet.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, there’s your girlfriend. You actually
gonna talk to her this time?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What the hell are you doing? That was a
perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to
White Castle.</p>

<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, it’s only awkward because you’re a
pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won’t be weird
anymore…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It doesn’t matter. The only girls interested
in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of
those 58 Asian clubs she’s in is throwing a party at her dorm
tonight.</p>

go.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. street 28</strong>: Harold and Kumar finally reach
Harold’s car…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Jesus, that took forever. You know the
purpose of a car is to avoid walking. And what kind of parking job is
this? You’re like a mile away from the curb.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t even start.</p>

<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t have anymore change.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Should I just go through?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I don’t like breaking the law.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>big burly guy</strong>: Hey! Move your ass!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m going through.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Just hold on. I’ll walk over to one of the
manned booths and tell them what happened.</p>
<p><strong>big burly guy</strong>: Move, you fucking twat!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh shit, we’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you?!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You just tore out of there! The cops are

<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Now we’re in Newark of all places. You know
we’re gonna get shot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Maybe it’s not as bad as they say. It’s
probably just a bunch of hype.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Let’s get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>40 ext. martin luther king blvd 40</strong>: Directly in
front of Harold’s Infiniti, A BASKETBALL GAME IS</p>
<p><strong>going on between a bunch of huge black dudes, right in
the</strong>: MIDDLE OF THE STREET! The BASKETBALL PLAYERS briefly look
over at Harold’s Infiniti before continuing their game.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Dude, we are NOT driving through that
basketball game!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We have to if we want to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Forget about it. No way.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Come on. How do you know they’re not peaceful
Gregory Hines-like black guys?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Turn the car around.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Why? Are cars not allowed to go through when
a game’s going on? When we were kids, we used to move to the side when
we were playing in the street.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: For some reason, I don’t think this is the
same thing.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m going through.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Look. They’re moving. I told you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shit, he’s gonna throw the ball at us.</p>

<p><strong>43 ext. highway - 9:45 pm 43</strong>: We see Harold’s

twenty of those burgers.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’ll see your twenty and raise you five
orders of fries.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: God, where the hell is this place?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: There’s the multiplex!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: That means the White Castle should be just
around the corner…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the hell’s going on, Kumar?! That
doesn’t look like a White Castle to me!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We gotta get to the bottom of this!</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. burger shack drive thru - 10:00 pm 48</strong>: KUMAR
drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a chubby BURGER
SHACK EMPLOYEE…</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: I’m sorry. You have to order
at the drive thru menu…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What happened to the White Castle?</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: There used to be a White Castle right in this
spot. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: Oh yeah. There was a White
Castle here. Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger
Shack bought this location four years ago.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Please tell me there’s another White Castle
in town.</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: Do I look like the type of
guy who would be unsure about something like this?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shit. What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know. Should we just eat here?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Do you really think that’ll satisfy us?</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: There’s a 24 hour White
Castle in Cherry Hill, about forty-five minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I can make the trip if you’re willing to.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar, I have a shitload of work to finish.
And you have that med school interview in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Forget about the med school interview. It’s a
non-issue.</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: If I may interject for a
moment… I’ve been an employee here for three years now, and if there’s
one thing I’ve learned, it’s that when you’re craving White Castle, the
burgers here simply won’t cut it. In fact, just thinking about those
tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me
want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its
place. If I were you, I’d suck it up and make the trip.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You can always do your work in the car.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Then it’s settled. No matter what, we’re not
ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: Wise choice. Besides, you
wouldn’t want to go near our special sauce tonight. Some of the guys and
I added an extra ingredient, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>burger shack employee</strong>: I’ll give you a hint… It’s
semen.</p>

<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding
us some weed.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh no. I’m not seeing Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the
phone all the time.</p>

East Asian Students club or whatever.</p>

investment banker if you would write me a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What it’s like being an investment banker?
Well Kenneth, to be honest, it’s pretty…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: …awesome?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: As for the recommendation, I may be able to

their tracks when they see the EAST ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in
full blast. All the “nerdy” asian kids from Cindy’s room are grinding
with each other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP. Harold and Kumar look at
each other in shock. Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot.
Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT

<p><strong>cute asian chick #1</strong>: Hey, K-dog! Can we have some

you’re not into her just might make you gay!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I know Cindy’s cute, it’s just…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What? You’d rather have Maria?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look, it doesn’t matter. I’m gonna end up

<p><strong>60 ext. woods near road - 11:50 pm 60</strong>: KUMAR gets
out of the car . He walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen

<p><strong>62 ext. bush near dark road 62</strong>: KUMAR is still
peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips
his pants and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy – totally confused. The Creepy Guy simply
goes about his business. It’s clear that Kumar wants to say something.
He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can’t take it
anymore…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Excuse me…I’m sorry, I just have to ask
you…why are you peeing here?</p>
<p><strong>creepy guy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Why did you decide to piss here right next to
me? Why not that bush over there?</p>
<p><strong>creepy guy</strong>: Well, this looked like a good bush to
pee on. Why’d you choose this bush?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Nobody was here when I chose this bush.</p>
<p><strong>creepy guy</strong>: So you can pee here and nobody else can,
is that it?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I was just saying….</p>
<p><strong>creepy guy</strong>: Is this like your special bush or
something?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No, I just… You know what? Forget about it.
I’m not in the mood to get stabbed right now.</p>

worry. Once we get on the highway, we’ll be there soon.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We better.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shit, now it’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look, I’m completely on edge right now,
okay? After all the shit we’ve been through tonight, I don’t know how

SWERVING BACK AND FORTH.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. car 65</strong>: HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF
OF HIM. He holds it as far away from his face as possible. The raccoon’s
arms and legs are scurrying around– trying to escape.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: How the hell did that get in here?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies
now or something!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry. He didn’t even break your skin.
You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, that’s not good!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon
away from me!!!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Thank Christ!</p>
<p><strong>harold kumar</strong>: Shit!!! Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the
brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other,
breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his
car and begins walking over to them.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: What the hell do you think you were
doing? You almost killed us!</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Holy Shit!</p>

in the middle of the road.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: We got the munchies, so we’re out trying
to find a Hot Dog Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: What about you guys? How was White
Castle?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We haven’t gotten there yet. I think I got
rabies, though.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude– how were Katie Holmes’ tits?</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: You know the holocaust?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Picture the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Apologize to Hashem.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Who the hell is…</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Just apologize!</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Okay, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: You really need to meet a girl.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, if you have the yellow fever tonight,
there’s a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Man, I have the yellow plague. There’s
nothing sexier than a hot Asian chick…or dude for that matter…</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Come on, let me suck it…let me see it and
suck on it…come on, Rold, let’s rub our dicks together…Jewish
swordfight…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Will you stop it? I’m feeling very woozy. I
may have to go to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, you don’t have rabies! We’re not going
to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>goldstein</strong>: Yo, we gotta hit this Asian party.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Oh no! No more detours! Let’s just stick
with the plan and get to Krispee Kreme. You guys wouldn’t believe some
of the weird shit we’ve been through the last couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>73 ext. hospital - 12:20 am 73</strong>: Establishing.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. hospital waiting room 74</strong>: Kumar is sitting
in the waiting room. He hides his head in a jittery manner, as if he’s
hiding from someone. Next to him are DANIEL and SHANKAR, who are both
badly beaten and nursing their wounds. They all make eye contact. It’s
weird.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t have rabies.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Great, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>man with thick indian accent</strong>: Kumar!!!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh, now I see why you didn’t want to come to
the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>kumar’s father</strong>: I hope you are here to apologize for
what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend
of mine, and let’s just say he was not at all amused by your antics…and
neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>saikat</strong>: What the hell’s wrong with you, Kumar? Look
at me. I own my own house. I drive a beamer. And I get laid whenever I
want. You can have all that too, if you’d just get off your ass and go
to med school.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Eat my balls, Saikat.</p>
<p><strong>saikat</strong>: God, you’re 22 years old already! When are
you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit? Like
your life is so tough.</p>
<p><strong>kumar’s father</strong>: I will not tolerate this business
from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the
last one I’m setting up for you.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 48.</strong>: KUMAR’S
FATHER</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh, come on, dad!</p>
<p><strong>kumar’s father</strong>: “Daddy will not be coming on
anything!” You will be there and you will behave! I’ve put too much time
and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You’re right. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>kumar’s father</strong>: Good. I’ll speak with you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wow. So I guess you’re going to med school
after all, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I
can’t wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the
interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don’t need his
money!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But…you just hugged him…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I just needed to get my hands on these…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Two words– medical marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>74a int. doctor’s lounge 74a</strong>: Using the SCAN CARDS,
Harold and Kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical
supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar grabs a couple and hands one to
Harold. They put them on…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Look, I’m telling you, they see an Indian and
Asian guy wearing these and they’ll just assume we’re doctors. Then we
walk right into the pharmacy and get the weed.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. hallway 75</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR walk out of the
lounge and head down the hallway…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: If we get caught, you’re taking the blame.
This wasn’t my idea.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re not gonna get caught. We’re gonna get
toasted and then we’re gonna eat delicious White Castle– just like we
planned.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Dr. Patel, thank God I found you! I need
your help immediately!</p>
<p><strong>76 int. emergency room 76</strong>: The scene is very fast
paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is
confused and concerned as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a
patient…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the hell’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: He must think I’m Saikat. Don’t worry. Leave
the talking up to me.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: The patient was brought in by EMS five
minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior
abdomen. No exit wounds.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh shit! This guy’s gonna die!!!</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: It’s a good thing I found you two. All
the other surgeons are working on other patients…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all
wrong. We’re not doc…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need
to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Alright. I’ll get the
anesthesiologist.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hold on. What we should probably use is
marijuana. That’ll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Marijuana? But why…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We don’t have time for questions! We need
marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it!</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: But doctor, we don’t have marijuana in
this hospital.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: We’re losing him! You gotta do
something!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Very well. I guess we’ll have to do this the
old fashioned way.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want
stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on
board.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Doctor! The patient is desatting!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Ah, I see. The Patient’s got a collapsed
lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What’s taking so long?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: Great catch doctor! His sat is up to
94!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Will one of you guys put the chest tube in
and wrap this up?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, it looks like my work here is done.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Say, you wouldn’t happen to know the quickest
way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you?</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. town streets - 1:00 am 77</strong>: Harold’s car is
cruising down some streets lined with stores.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. harold’s infiniti 78</strong>: Harold is very
excited. Kumar is proud of himself, but playing it cool.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m telling you. That was amazing! Even your
dad would’ve been impressed!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah. It wasn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is perfect! We’re back on the road. We
have directions now. The rain let up. And guess what…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m officially done with my work. I’m
telling you, things are finally starting to go our way.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, check it out! Your movie’s playing.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: And look who went to see it…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You see? You thought you two had nothing in
common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies.
Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No way. Forget about it. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Harold. It’s one in the morning. We’re an
hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside
a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy
romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the
moment I’d tell you “this is a sign.”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Come on. Just pretend you’re a nerdy Asian
Tom Hanks and she’s a hot Latina Meg Ryan…with bigger tits. Besides, you
yourself said things are starting to go our way…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Let’s just go!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey Maria!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, get your hand off the gas!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>down a dirt and rock covered hill.</strong>: KUMAR grabs
control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. HAROLD is
bumping around on the way down the hill. Finally, they reach the bottom
of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You asshole! My car’s probably all scratched
up now!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t blame me. You’re the one who ran us off
the road!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I told you I didn’t want to speak to her!
Whatever. Let’s jut get back on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>79 ext. side of the road - 1:15 am 79</strong>: HAROLD
examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There’s not another
car in site.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Godammit. You know how to change a flat?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how
to change a tire.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Where’s my spare tire?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shit, where the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh yeah! Don’t you remember that time we got
baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would
float?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What bridge? What the hell are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh shit. That’s right. I was with Goldstein.
We borrowed your car that day. My bad.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Your bad? What are the hell are we gonna do
now?!</p>
<p><strong>ugly man</strong>: You boys need some help?</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. dirt road - 1:20 am 80</strong>: The UGLY MAN’S TRUCK
tows Harold’s Infiniti down a dirt road.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. truck 81</strong>: The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is
in the front seat, on the passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between
them.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thanks for helping us out.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded
there and thought to myself, “what would Jesus do?”</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: So, you boys worship Christ?</p>
<p><strong>harold kumar</strong>: Uh…Yeah. Sure, he’s great.</p>
<p><strong>ugly man</strong>: Great. Good to hear it. The name’s
Randy…but everyone calls me Freak Show.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m Kumar. This is Harold. Good to meet you,
Mr…Freak Show.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Pleasure’s all mine.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So where exactly are we going?</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Don’t worry. My place isn’t too far from
here. Once we get there, I’ll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Eww– check out those boils on his neck!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh my God! You gotta look! One of them’s
actually pulsating!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Will you shut up? He’s right next to me! He
can hear you!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Now there’s some sort of puss! It’s the most
disgusting thing I’ve ever seen!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s the matter with you? You think that
just because you’re whispering, he can’t hear what you’re saying? He’s
two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear
me talking right now.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry, he can’t hear anything. Not with
all that crust in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: I heard every word you said.</p>
<p><strong>82 ext. freak show’s house - 1:30 am 82</strong>: HAROLD and
KUMAR stand by their car, as FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new
tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Now it’s gonna take me a little while
here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have
something to drink, watch tv– anything you want. Mi casa es su casa.
Just don’t do anything Jesus wouldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his
wife?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He couldn’t have said that.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: But he did! It may have been in mid-
sentence, but it was still clear as day.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Who cares? You’ve seen Freak Show. What do
you think his wife is gonna look like?</p>
<p><strong>83 int. freak show’s house 83</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR walk
inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL TIME walk out of the kitchen.
She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates
her chest.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Hi. I’m Freak Show’s wife, Liane. Would you
boys like some pink lemonade?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Let me go bring in a pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Okay. It’s official. We’ve entered the
Twilight Zone.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, Liane is fucking hot!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s not ugly.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Thanks. So, tell me Liane– how are things
between you and Freak Show presently?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Oh, never been better. We love each other
very much.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Can I ask– how does a guy…like Freak
Show…end up with a woman like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four
years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then– you know, because of all
the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing
voice – like a baby canary.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Well, one day after Easter service, I told
him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage
and asked me out. The rest is history. And we’ve been in love ever
since.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: So you boys gonna fuck me or what?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes
first?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wait a second– what about Freak Show…and
this whole Christian thing you guys have going on?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Oh, so just because we’re passionate about
our Lord, you assume we don’t know how to have a good time?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No, I just…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Nevermind. Okay, rock, paper, scissors…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Sorry– if you boys want me, you gotta do me
at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Come on. Give me the double stuff.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m not sure we quite understand…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I want you both inside me simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Um, are we talking about one hole or two?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: However you want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sorry, no thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad.
Shotgun anus!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Forget it! I don’t want our balls rubbing
against each other. No way!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow
jobs!?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Well…okay. Can you help me with this…?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Do you want to play with them?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Okay, let’s do that.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Hey boys– I changed your tire…</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: What the hell are you doing with my
wife!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uhh…you said outside that we can have sex
with her!</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: I most certainly did not say that!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No. You did. We both heard you.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Oh…my mistake then.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Well, since we’re all here, why not make
it a foursome?</p>
<p><strong>freak show</strong>: Who wants the first reach-around?</p>
<p><strong>84 ext. freak show’s house 84</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR
burst out the front door and run towards their car. They get in and peel
out as fast as they can.</p>
<p><strong>85 ext. dirt road - 1:45 am 85</strong>: Harold’s Infiniti is
driving down a dusty trail in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Okay, let’s agree never to talk about what
just happened.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, I have no idea where we are.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh, calm down. We’re lost. He may know how to
get us back on the highway.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Fuck that! It’s my car! We’re not picking up
a hitchhiker!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yo, man, thanks for picking me up.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uh…excuse me, but…are you Neil Patrick
Harris?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my
favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, that’s great. Do you think we could get
going? I’m bored as shit back here.</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. dirt road 87</strong>: We see Harold’s Infiniti drive
back onto the road…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So, Neil, I have to ask you– did you ever get
it on with Wanda off the set?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that
show.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Even the chick who played the hot nurse?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No, I didn’t go all the way with her.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey, you don’t know how to get back on the
highway, do you?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I don’t even know where the fuck I am right
now. I was at this party earlier tonight, and this dude hooked me up
with some killer X. Somehow I ended up getting thrown out of a moving
car, and I’ve been tripping balls ever since.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, our night’s been pretty crazy too.
We’ve been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but
we keep getting sidetracked.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Dude, forget White Castle. What we need is
some pussy.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s a fucking sausage fest in here. Let’s get
us some poon-tang. Then we’ll go to White Castle.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You don’t understand, Neil. We’ve been
craving these burgers all night.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ve been craving burgers too. Fur burgers,
that is.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 65.</strong>: NEIL</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, there’s a gas station! Let’s stop and
get directions.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. gas station/convenience store - 1:50 am 89</strong>:
HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car. NEIL is still in the backseat. The
car is still running.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’ll be right back, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’s the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
Why’s he so horny?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I don’t know. But we can’t let him interfere
with our quest.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Late night math league meeting, homos?</p>
<p><strong>extreme sports punk #1</strong>: Extreme!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh shit. These idiots.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. convenience store 90</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR walk
into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly
knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing
HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER throws out a couple
indecipherable protests…</p>
<p><strong>indian cashier</strong>: Please…the pies…do not…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Excuse me– can you tell us how to get onto
the highway from here?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: He probably can’t speak English…</p>
<p><strong>kumar says a few words in hindi, which lights up
the</strong>: CASHIER’S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
directions in Hindi– it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it. He
mentions numerous streets and routes. It sounds like it’s very
complicated. Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK AND A
PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store. Harold has no
idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the CASHIER are too busy
talking to notice. Harold watches nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND
GETS INTO THE KAYAK…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Who knew that learning Hindi would actually
pay off? The guy says the highway’s just down the road. We should be in
Cherry Hill in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh? Oh, good.</p>
<p><strong>extreme kayaking!!!</strong>: HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN
CASHIER immediately turn and look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK– WHICH IS
BEING HELD UP BY</p>
<p><strong>the kayak and launch it into the air…</strong>: In slow
motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid- air, KNOCKING OVER
EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES– BAGS OF CHIPS,</p>
<p><strong>glass jars of jelly, bottles of soda, etc.</strong>: The
EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN
CASHIER watch in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That was so fucking extreme, man!</p>
<p><strong>extreme sports punk #1</strong>: Yeah man, on a scale from
one to ten– one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I’d
give it a nine point five.</p>
<p><strong>extreme sports punk #1</strong>: Extreme Cheddar!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Extreme Cashier!!!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Somebody should do something.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey asshole! Why don’t you leave the guy
alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.</p>
<p><strong>extreme sports punks</strong>: Oooooooooh!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I didn’t mean you should do something.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, bitch! Try fucking with me
one more time. Just try it!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Come on, lets get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Thank you, come again!</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. gas station/convenience store 91</strong>: HAROLD and
KUMAR walk back towards their car…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar– you okay?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah, I just hate those dicks. Fuck it. At
least now we know where we’re going. I’m so friggin’ hungry…</p>
<p><strong>off, driving through a sign, and getting on the
road…</strong>: Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds,
without saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking
car?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I think he did.</p>
<p><strong>fuck!!!!!!</strong>: You! You had to pick up a
hitchhiker!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rold, calm down!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why the hell did you leave the keys in the
car?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a
trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he’d fuck us over?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is all your fault! This whole fucking
night! You know I leased that car! They’re gonna make me pay for it!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m going to call the police! I don’t want
to talk to you anymore!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: There’s a pay phone across the street, if you
don’t want to deal with those assholes.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So after you talk to the cops we’re still
going to White Castle, right?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m not speaking to you.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You know, pressing the button a bunch of
times doesn’t make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to
the first press. Every press after that is extraneous.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Wizard.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking
develop button technology that’ll understand urgency?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: This is ridiculous. Just walk across.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’ll change in a second.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Come on, there’s not a car in sight!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Alright fine. You want me to cross? I’ll
cross. Just leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Good evening. Is there a problem,
Officer…Palumbo?</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Is there a problem? Ever hear of
jaywalking?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes. Yes I have. I’m so sorry. I promise
I’ll never do it again.</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Yeah, like I give a fuck. I’m
writing you up a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: A ticket?! Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Who the fuck are you, shitwad?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I
will pay the fine. But actually, I’m glad you’re here. You know the TV
show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car
and…</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Pipe down and give me your ID.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Wait. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 72.</strong>:
KUMAR</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar, shut up…</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Yeah, that’s not the best tone to
use on a cop who could bust your ass.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Bust my ass?!</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass.
What’s with that name – Koo-mar – with like three o’s and shit. What
happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Harold.</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Yes. Harold. That’s a great name.
You should be proud of that name, son.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: As you were, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: 220 dollars!? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar, I swear to God, if you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No, no, no. I understand what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Hey, hands down! No sudden
moves!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Let me guess. You were probably the big
asshole in your high school, right? You’d pick on guys like us every
day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went
nowhere, so you thought, “How can I still give them shit? I know! I’ll
become a cop!” Well, congratulations. Your dream’s come true.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, while you’re at it, why don’t you write
him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. jail cell - 2:30 am 92</strong>: The CELL DOOR SLAMS.
Harold is behind bars.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey, are you gonna do something about my
car? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your
donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>hippie asshole’s mom</strong>: Well, thank you for being so
understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won’t ever do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Oh, I’m sure he won’t. Not after
the talk we had, right Brad?</p>
<p><strong>hippie asshole</strong>: Mom– please take me home…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Can I at least give you my car’s licence
plate number?</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: The search for the escaped cheetah
continues tonight. It was last spotted in Randolph Township, heading
South…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: So what are you in here for?</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: For being black.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Come on. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: I am serious. You wanna know what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and
a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark.
Therefore, since I’m black, it was probably me, right?</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: Well that was the logic the cop used. I told
him I haven’t even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me
and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, “Hey, I’m not resisting
anything.” So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me,
telling me to stop resisting.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Holy shit. What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: I kept saying, “I understand that I’m under
arrest. Please stop beating me.” But that didn’t work. Then another cop
showed up. Then another. When it was all said and done, it took nine
cops to bring me in here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That fucking blows!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t understand how you’re able to be so
calm about all this.</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: Son, I’m fat. I’m black. I can’t dance. And I
have two gay fathers. I’ve had people messing with me my whole life. I
learned a long time ago, there’s no point in getting all riled up every
time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time. Because in the end, the
universe tends to unfold as it should.</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: So what are you in here for?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Assaulting an officer.</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: They tried to pin that shit on you too?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I actually did hit the cop. But only
because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend.</p>
<p><strong>officer reilly</strong>: Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun
shots fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Finally, some action! I’m
going!</p>
<p><strong>officer martone</strong>: No– I’m going!</p>

are now left all alone in their cell.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That was strange.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rold? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Are the cops still there?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No, they… Wait a second, did you…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I called and made up some story about a
shooting in Millbrook park…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m fucking starving! I figured I’d bust you
out, and we’d get over to White Castle.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Forget it! I don’t want to get in any more
trouble! I’m already in here because of you!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do?
Stand there and take the hit? You know, I’ve never taken a swing at you
before. Never.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, I never got your car stolen!</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: Hey, I’m trying to read here.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Look, Rold, I’m sorry. But you’re not the
only one dealing with shit. My dad’s cutting me off, remember?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey asshole, I’m in jail! Don’t bitch to me
about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don’t want your help.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You don’t want my help? Fine! I’m outta
here!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Uh…Rold? How do I get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How the hell should I know?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: This isn’t good.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Ow…my ass.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You sure you don’t want to get out?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy
has all my information.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So what? We’ll take everything he wrote down
about you and leave. Unless you want to stay here all night and not be
able to hand your work in tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Fine. Hurry up.</p>

THE POLICE CARS RETURNING TO THE STATION.</p>
<p><strong>96 int. police station 96</strong>: Kumar finds A BIG METAL
KEY RING on Palumbo’s desk…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these
big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one
will…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar, hurry the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Kumar?…Kumar!</p>

bag of weed face each other and kiss…</p>
<p><strong>102a int. kumar’s bedroom - night 102a</strong>: A NAKED
KUMAR and THE BAG OF WEED are kissing in bed. The BAG OF WEED starts to
go under the covers. We watch, as the sheets move up and down. KUMAR
STARTS TO HAVE AN ORGASM… THE BAG OF WEED comes up from under the
covers. Kumar gives it a kiss. THEN, HE GOES UNDER THE COVERS. We see
THE BAG</p>
<p><strong>103 int. kitchen table - afternoon 103</strong>: KUMAR is
frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED comes out of the
kitchen holding a MUG OF</p>
<p><strong>depressed, the bag of weed walks away from the

He obviously feels guilty…</p>
<p><strong>104 int. jail cell 104</strong>: Kumar walks away from the
cell, goes over to the desk, picks up the bag of weed and caresses
it…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the hell are you…</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: You thought you could get away with
this, huh?</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: Where am I? I was in bed. I didn’t fire
any gun, I swear…</p>
<p><strong>officer reilly</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Shit! Jackson’s trying to
escape!</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: What? Oh, not again!</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: Stop trying to escape!</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: I’m not trying to escape! Look at me, I’m
sitting down!</p>
<p><strong>officer reilly</strong>: He’s trying to break free! Hold him
tight!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Wait– shouldn’t we do something about
this?</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: If I were you, I’d get out of here as

<p><strong>105 ext. police station 105</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR burst
out the door and run down the steps. They race through the street and

stopped running. They start catching their breath.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad
house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, man, the burgers wouldn’t taste as good
if you weren’t there. Dude, look at this. It’s like we went from being
broke to being millionaires.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Just a coyote. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Aren’t people supposed to be scared of
coyotes?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: That’s only because they sound scary. In one
on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Now cheetahs, they’re another story.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’re gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating
zebras and shit. They’re not known for eating humans.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We’re gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Okay, I’ll admit, that’s not a good sign. But
I’m sure if we just stay calm he’ll probably leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>he’s mauling me! he’s mauling me!</strong>: HAROLD continues
screaming for the next TEN SECONDS. Eventually, he calms down and looks
at the CHEETAH.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I thought I told you not to take that
jerky!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: He likes me.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, I think I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’ll tell you, but first we have to get
really high.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. forest - day 108</strong>: Harold and Kumar are now
sitting on top of the CHEETAH, smoking joints. Kumar has a belt around
the cheetah’s neck like reigns on a horse.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Has it come to this? Are we really gonna
ride this cheetah?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the
planet. It’s as good as a car.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is either a really smart move, or by
far the stupidest thing we’ve ever done.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, we’ll soon find out. Mush! Mush!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Dude, am I just really high or is this is
actually working?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Both!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This is great! We’ll be at White Castle in
no…</p>
<p><strong>smack! a branch hits harold in the face, knocking him off

His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious…</p>
<p><strong>109 ext. the land of burgers - day 109</strong>: THE LAND OF
BURGERS is an OZ-like world– the entire terrain, with all it’s rolling
hills, IS MADE UP OF HAMBURGERS. Music plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip
through THE LAND OF BURGERS, holding hands. Along the way, they run by…
The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with each other,
in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY gives Harold the same scary
look from before…. FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground
into a wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out a
CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he’s waving with. KUMAR and the
MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while getting high. After a spin of
the wheel, Kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like he’s
taking the Male Nurse from behind. Kumar’s not happy. Harold and Maria
fall to the ground– they roll down a hill, UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF
MARIA. Harold picks up a burger from the ground. Maria does the same.
They proceed to feed each other their burgers. They munch on them,
looking into each other’s eyes…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I love you, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I love you, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Wow, you guys are really extreme…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …extremely gay that is.</p>
<p><strong>starts gushing out. he falls off the kayak, into the
water.</strong>: HAROLD is shocked. He turns around and sees MARIA,
HOLDING A CROSSBOW. She smiles at him. HE THEN JUMPS ON TOP OF HER</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God– you have the
biggest dick of all time! It’s so long! And wide, for that matter!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Don’t worry about him…</p>
<p><strong>110 ext. woods near road - 4:00 am 110</strong>: HAROLD wakes
up to find KUMAR LICKING HIS FACE. HAROLD JUMPS</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!!!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I’m sorry! You’ve been out cold for the past
half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you’d wake
up.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What happened to the cheetah?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: It ran away. But forget about that. I have
some bad news and some worse news.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tell me the worse news first.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: I checked out some road signs. The cheetah
took us in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That sucks. What’s the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Your laptop is completely destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: It smashed against a tree when you fell off
the cheetah.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you say that THAT was
the “worse news”?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Well, the laptop really only effects you.
Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh no! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry, dude. Your laptop’s insured.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s not that! All my work was saved in
there! Now I gotta go back to the office and re-do everything!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Exactly. First, we’ll take a cab over to
White Castle, then we’ll…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Forget White Castle. There’s no time!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Come on, Rold! You can get that shit done in
a couple hours. We can’t quit now!</p>
<p><strong>112 ext. street 112</strong>: Harold and Kumar stand there,
speechless, as Neil drives right past them, splashing a puddle in
Harold’s face! They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off.
Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He
gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he shouldn’t push Harold any
further.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fine…We’ll find a pay phone and get a cab
back to your office.</p>
<p><strong>112a ext. dirt road 112a</strong>: Kumar, disappointed, walks
down the road with a miserable Harold. When they reach the corner…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Look, there’s a Krispee Kreme. We’ll call
from there.</p>
<p><strong>113 ext. krispee kreme donuts 113</strong>: Harold and Kumar
walk over to the parking lot. Unfortunately, they notice a familiar
YELLOW JEEP COVERED IN STICKERS.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh great. Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hey Apu!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Who’s running the Quik-E-Mart while you’re
gone?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fucking asshole.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I want that.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What? A chocolate cream filled?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I want that feeling. The feeling that
comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. I NEED
that feeling.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Are you saying what I think you’re
saying?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We gotta go to White Castle.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yes! I knew you had it in you!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Is that Cindy Kim?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You should have boned her when you had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey, why don’t you just leave us alone?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it,
Mr. Miagi?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Fuck! I’m so sick of their bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Don’t worry. The universe tends to unfold as
it should.</p>

<p><strong>harold</strong>: It’s working isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Those assholes got to have White Castle?!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: This world is so unfair.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry . Forget about that. We have a
car now. We’re back in the game. Pretty soon we’ll be eating our own
White Castle. Want me to drive?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. I’ve got everything under control. We
should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done
after our feast. Just find us some tunes.</p>

around a turn in the road and then CUTS</p>
<p><strong>into the forest, disappearing in the woods…</strong>: We then

<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh shit! We’re trapped!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No. No way. Not a chance. I’d rather turn
myself in than die.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, it’s okay. I used to hang-glide with my
dad all the time when I was kid. I know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You hang-glided? I don’t remember that.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We did it on our trips to India. I swear. I
know exactly what I’m doing. I’ve even done it with two people at the
same time. My brother and I did it.</p>

<p><strong>harold</strong>: No, Kumar. I’m not risking my life over a
bunch of hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You think this just about the burgers, huh?
Well, let me tell you– it’s about far more than that.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Our parents came to this country, escaping
persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very
hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A
land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land
filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger.
Hundreds of types– with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That
land was America.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You think this is just about the burgers?
No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about
the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: And so we’ve reached this point. The point
which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. We can
stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I
leave the decision up to you.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I hate you, Kumar.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hurry up…they’re almost here!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on
tight.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Okay. Here’s how this is gonna work. On the
count of three, we’re gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say
“jump,” launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got
it?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Don’t worry– everything’s gonna be fine. Are
you ready?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Okay, here goes. One…two…three!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Good job, Rold! Keep running!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rold, there’s something I gotta tell you.
I’ve never hang-glided before.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, it’s working!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I can’t believe you lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to
jump off a cliff?</p>
<p><strong>140 ext. cliff - 6:46 am 140</strong>: OFFICER BRUCKS gets
out of the car, holding his rifle and runs over to the jeep. He looks
inside…</p>
<p><strong>officer brucks</strong>: It appears they’ve escaped. They
ditched their jeep.</p>
<p><strong>officer brucks</strong>: Good news. I found enough dope in
the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple
years. Looks like they’ve terrorized their last convenience store.</p>
<p><strong>140a ext. old pick up truck - day 140a</strong>: OFFICER
BRUCKS and the BAG OF WEED drink bottles of BUDWEISER while sitting in
the back of a PICKUP TRUCK.</p>
<p><strong>140b ext. skeet shooting range - day 140b</strong>: BRUCKS is
skeet shooting, as the BAG OF WEED watches. Brucks gives the bag a kiss,
after a successful round.</p>
<p><strong>140c int. barn - night 140c</strong>: BRUCKS is having sex
with the bag doggy-style. He slaps it’s “ass” as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>140d ext. cliff - night 140d</strong>: BRUCKS hugs and
caresses the BAG OF WEED, as he’s lost in the fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>141 ext. mid-air - 6:50 am 141</strong>: Our triumphant heros
are gliding across the morning sky. Harold and Kumar look down as they
soar above the trees…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Dude, we’re so high right now.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re not low.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey, Kumar?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: How are we gonna get down?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Uh…well…I guess it’s just gonna go down at
some point.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s a great answer. Made me feel really
comfortable. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Is it a problem if we fly into birds?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Because we’re about to!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Ahhhh! My eyes! Don’t peck out my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re gonna die! We’re gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I hate you! I hate you so much!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We’re gonna live! Ha! Ha! We’re gonna live!
You see, Rold? That wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>finally– they stop rolling when they hit hard
pavement.</strong>: HAROLD gets up before he can catch his breath…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s it…I’m gonna kill you…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Stop…I…can’t…breathe…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: That’s the point!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rold…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You’re gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Rold…look!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: We made it, dude.</p>
<p><strong>142 int. white castle - 7:00 am 142</strong>: Harold and
Kumar walk inside. Their shirts are torn and tattered, their bodies are
scratched up, and they’re covered in dirt. Everyone in the restaurant
turns and stares at them. They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER
STANDING…</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Looks like you guys had some night,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I want thirty slyders. I want five french
fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Same. Only make mine Diet Cokes.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Wow. That comes to…forty-two dollars and
seventy-five cents.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey…hey…hey…where’s my money?!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You don’t have money?! Shit, I gave all mine
to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck that hippie fuck! This can’t be
happening! We’re so close and we’re fucking broke!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Let me take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You guys kept talking about White Castle last
night. It made me start craving it too.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Where’s my fucking car you prick!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I was
tripping balls last night. I don’t know what came over me. Your car’s
out in the parking lot. Here are the keys.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Do you realize what we had to go through
after you stole the car?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I know. It was a dick move on my part. That’s
why I’m paying for your meal.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Thanks, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Here’s fifty for the meal, and two hundred for
the car.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What happened to the car?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I made some love stains in the back seat.
You’ll see. Anyway, take it easy guys. I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Wherever God takes me.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Hey guys…it’s gonna take a little while to
make all those burgers. You might as well sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, we’re here. Isn’t it great?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I know. I can’t believe we made it. AND we
got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can
get back to my office and get the work done.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>female anchor</strong>: Today’s top story…Rutgers professor
Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel Banks are suing the state of New
Jersey for racial discrimination and police brutality. We go live to the
municipal state courthouse in Muckleburg…</p>
<p><strong>tarik</strong>: What happened last night was a complete moral
travesty. My family and I are outraged and will not settle for anything
less than justice…</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: And by justice, we mean somewhere in the
ballpark of ten million dollars….</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hey, good for those black guys!</p>
<p><strong>on the television:</strong>: We see footage of OFFICER
PALUMBO and THE OTHER COPS taken away in handcuffs…</p>
<p><strong>officer palumbo</strong>: I’m not racist! This is bullshit!
If those black bastards think they’re gonna get away with this, they’ve
got another thing coming! Me and my white buddies are gonna them up!</p>
<p><strong>female anchor</strong>: This just in…police have arrested a
gang of hooligans…</p>
<p><strong>female anchor</strong>: …after they found their abandoned car
in the forest in Clifton, containing a large bag of marijuana. The young
men could face up to five years in prison.</p>
<p><strong>int. white castle</strong>: HAROLD and KUMAR slap five.</p>
<p><strong>female anchor</strong>: And finally…the Muckleburg Police
Department has informed us that they ARE STILL looking for ANOTHER
FUGITIVE who escaped from the Police Station last night, along with a
companion, believed to be his accomplice…</p>
<p><strong>int. white castle</strong>: HAROLD’S JAW DROPS. He’s scared
shitless.</p>
<p><strong>female anchor</strong>: Police have made the following sketch
of the two fugitives, which they believe to be quote “extremely
accurate.”</p>
<p><strong>on the screen, we see a horrible police sketch of
“harold”</strong>: and “KUMAR”– IT IS BASICALLY AN ASIAN MAN IN HIS
SEVENTIES</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Hey, guys…I got your orders!</p>
<p><strong>151 int. white castle - moments later 151</strong>: HAROLD
and KUMAR have put three tables together, on which we see SIXTY WHITE
CASTLE HAMBURGERS– EACH ONE STEAMING HOT. TWO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS stare at
Harold and Kumar’s orders, amazed by their size. They then look at their
own orders and realize how worthless they are. HAROLD and KUMAR are
sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of
them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Wait…let’s do it together.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. white castle - 7:45 am 152</strong>: HAROLD and
KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look full and satisfied.
Harold takes one last sip of his soda.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh…that hit the spot.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: It was the best meal of my life.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Mine too.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude, you know what? I think I may actually
go to my interview today.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Yeah. You know, my whole life I’ve been
afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor. Well, tonight
got me thinking…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: There are far worse things in the world than
being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Like having boils all over your face. Or
dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool
saving that guy’s life last night. Somewhere between that, getting
yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that
I’ve always wanted to be a doctor– I’ve just been too scared to admit
it.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, Rold, are you listening to me? I’m
having a major epiphany here.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’ll be right back…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Hey, Billy– you paying for this or what?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ll be there in a second…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look, I have to admit something to you. At
the start of last night, all I really cared about was getting some. But
then I met you, Zoe. You’re so different from all the other women I’ve
ever met. You’re smart, funny, artistic. I guess what I’m trying to say
is…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What the fuck is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Harold? What are you…?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Never mind me. What are you doing here? I
thought you and J.D. were busy all night with “clients.” Isn’t that why
I had to do YOUR work?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Hey! What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to
him goes double for you!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Cock boy? I’m sorry, but did you just call me
“cock boy?”</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yeah, you know I did. You’re just stalling
because you’re not quick enough to think of a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Oh, I’m not quick enough? He thinks I’m not
quick enough. Well, I got news for you… I am quick enough… …cock
boy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen Harry…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Don’t even bother with him. We’ll just tell
Berenson later…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Tell him what? That I’m your work horse!
That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your
work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: No, no– you don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: No, YOU don’t understand. I’m not doing your
work anymore.</p>

HAROLD</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: And I’ll tell everyone in the office how you
both caught gonorrhea from that whore.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get
going. See you on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>153 ext. white castle parking lot 153</strong>: HAROLD and
KUMAR walk over to Harold’s Infiniti…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that come
from?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I don’t know. Eating those delicious burgers
made me feel like a new man. Now I’m actually looking forward to work
this week.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: No shit! I guess you’re worthwhile after
all.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I’m not worthless.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: So those dudes have gonorrhea?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Beats me. Now, come on, let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: What’s the rush? There’s plenty of time
before my interview.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: I have some unfinished business to take care
of.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. hallway by the elevator - 9:02 am 157</strong>: The
elevator doors open. Harold and Kumar exit. Kumar gives Harold a pat on
the back…</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Good luck, dude.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh…uh…nothing…wrong room.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come back to bed!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Hey, Papi’s coming! Hold on! This girl is
crazy, man.</p>
<p><strong>double white revised pages may 28 2003 112.</strong>:
LUIS</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Look, I really don’t need to hear it. I
guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys…</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Hey– if you’re looking for Maria, she left for
Europe this morning.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: She’s going to Amsterdam for ten days. I’m
Luis – Maria’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Oh! Maria’s brother!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Actually, I’m Kor…wait a second– she talks
about me?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Are you coming or what?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Hey, I’ll be there in a second, baby. Do me a
favor– make me that omelette you were talking about. You know, with the
sun-dried tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: So you want me to leave her a message or
something?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Uh, no thanks. I’d rather do it in
person.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Then take it easy, hermano.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Dude…we gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Huh? Where?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now and
take the next plane.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What are you talking about? Are you out of
your mind? What about your interview with the med school guy?</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Whatever. I’ll tell my dad to reschedule it.
He won’t have a problem, as long as I’m taking it seriously for a
change. Now, let’s fly to Europe and find Maria!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: She’s coming back in ten days! It’s not like
I’m never gonna see her again.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the
kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over
her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Forget it. I’ll just wait till she comes
back.</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: Hey, Rold! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>kumar</strong>: You do realize what’s legal in Amsterdam,
right?</p>
