<h1 id="sexual-life">sexual-life</h1>
<p><strong>various close angles</strong>: We FLOAT through miniature
coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, where toy figures are arranged in
tableau of everyday life</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Terri. Why did you let me sleep so late?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: She probably forgot what day it is, right
Arthur? Some friend she turned out to be. Not like you. You remember
what day it is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Hmm. Simon and Garfunkel hit. Eight letters.
Any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign,
the one that used to hang next to the pies?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What sign?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: The one that said, “Today is the first day of
the rest of your life.”</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That thing? We got rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Have you decided?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: She’ll have the steak and egg special.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Look at her, she needs protein. Lots of
protein.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Working early today, huh?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No, I had something important to do…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: …Miss nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I knew you’d remember.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Of course I remembered. Go on, open it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: No, no. I wasn’t born until ten minutes
before midnight. And that’s when I’ll open it.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You better like it. I don’t want to tell what
I had to do to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Ooh. It must be good.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: So what’s the plan, Stan? Something special
today? Other than splurging on toast.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Yes. There is something.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Good. Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: No. Something big. Something I’ve been
thinking about for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I can’t do this forever, Terri. Look…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Crow’s feet! I’m nineteen! Crow’s feet! I
know I keep talking about it, but this time I’m going to do it. In fact,
I did it. This is my last day.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I called them. I told them I was out.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You did not.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Uh-huh. I have one more appointment. Then,
I’m…free.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Give me your cell phone. I’m calling them
back right now.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: A bus ran over it. Isn’t that perfect? It’s a
perfect sign.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I know, I know. I’m not going to light the
damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Look, I’m good for next month’s rent.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What, you’re leaving too?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Maybe. Get out of town for a while. I really
feel good about this.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I wish you’d talked to me first.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I didn’t because…I knew you’d try to talk me
out of it.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: That’s because I’m looking out for you. It’s
because there is so much opportunity here.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Well…Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Your friend comin’ back?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: We’re in –</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Seventy-five, right? For the half-hour.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Not including tip.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: And, typically, the size of the tip is…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Depends on how generous you feel.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Is…this your first appointment?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No. I’ve done this before.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Come over here, you’re making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: So, how much extra do you feel like
spending?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I don’t know. Another fifty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: So, this is what you do. Weddings.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It pays the rent.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: These are good. You’re really a good
photographer.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, somebody thinks so. I get a lot of
work.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: And you can only spend another fifty on
me?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You have a great smile, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Yeah, I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: And I like your name. Lorna. Like the
cookie.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Gee, I’ve never hear that one before.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, I’m not afraid of sick images. In fact,
it’s what I aspire to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really
assault you, that reach out and slap you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well…I don’t know. Shake people out of
their…complacency. Your friend would understand. What’s her work
like?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: She photographs people pissing on each
other.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Yeah…disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Maybe that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: But who would want to look at that? I mean,
bathrooms have doors for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What do you like?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I like things that make me happy. Like
this.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I bet she’s going to have a very happy
life.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I don’t think I’m the marrying kind,
though.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Me, neither. Marriage, it’s so…medieval.
Sometimes when I’m doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and
think, “What a couple of lemmings.”</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I’m not sure people can be true, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Right. That, too.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Well…Now that we’ve gotten to know each
better, maybe we should get started.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Oh, you really have a big cock…My, you really
have a big cock…God, what a big cock you have.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Throughout the scene, our ANGLES generally
exclude Todd from view. We may HEAR him, but our focus is on –</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a
vaguely puzzled expressions. In fact, puzzles are on her mind.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Forty-two across…Simon &amp; Garfunkel
hit…eight letters…begins with ‘I’…I…I’m A Loser…Did they sing
that?…Susie used to play Mom’s Simon &amp; Garfunkel records all the
time…I scratched one once and she pulled my hair…I haven’t spoken to her
for almost a year…Her little kid must be walking by now…Maybe I should
give Susie a call…Nah, fuck that! She’s perfectly capable of calling
me…I mean, I’m listed…I’m…I am a rock…that’s it!…I Am A Rock, that’s the
answer…I am a–</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Wow. That was something.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah…was it?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Let me tell you…that was something.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Cut the modesty. You really know what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Nothing. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I’m fine. The cab fare will be another
twenty.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You never said anything about cab fare.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Of course I did. Are you calling me a
liar?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No. I swear, you didn’t say a word about
it.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You haven’t told me where we’re going yet.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Make a right at the light.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Go on, ask.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, after we…after we did it, you didn’t
really mean what you said, did you? About me being so good.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Pull over here.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: You see that hotel? In one of those rooms,
there’s a man waiting…he’s waiting for me. I don’t know what his name is
or what he looks like. He may have bad skin. He may be really ugly. But
no matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes weird
wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing…the same thing
I told you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Right…Well, that’s what I thought. I mean, a
guy would have to be pretty lame to think that…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: To think what?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: It’s Todd, right.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Well, Todd, you’re alright.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: If I wanted to see you again–</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: No. You can’t. You can’t see me again.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Lorna! Lorna!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And how much did this afternoon delight set
you back?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Oh. About a buck and a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Since when do you have a hundred and
twenty-five dollars to throw away?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m sure you spend just as much on porn
rentals.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There’s no comparison. Here, I’ll do the math
for you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You’re right. I can’t argue with that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Anyway, I stopped watching porno.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You did? Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They kinda depress me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: My imagination.</p>
<p><strong>later.</strong>: The couple is gone. Phil and Todd wrap some
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What’s Sarah got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re seeing her, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sarah…that’s a whole different situation.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But you’re doing it with her, right?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I like Sarah a lot. And I don’t want to blow
it by pushing too hard.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You mean, you haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Technically? No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: She won’t put out?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, no, no. You don’t get it. You can’t equate
the two. What I did with Lorna–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Lorna?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s her name. Lorna. I mean, that’s the
name she gave me. What I did with her…that was like going to some exotic
place. For a visit. Haven’t you ever wondered what that kind of person
is like? What that world is like? I was just…doing research. The lower
depths…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shit! Sold out!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I am so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s alright. I hear it’s really overrated.
And long.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I could just kill him! This is not the first
time he’s done this, either.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Done what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I’m
getting on the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: He’s your boss. Being an asshole is part of
the job description.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re talking about the most self-centered
man I have ever met. God forbid I should have a life, right?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ruin my evening. Our evening.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sarah. Take a breath.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Okay. I’m taking a breath.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Now, take another one.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I like you. Have I told you that?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You know what I want to do? I want to go
shopping.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Shopping? For what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For a house.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look at the detail on that one. Wow. Every
one of these is a gem. Makes the stuff I work on look pretty shabby by
comparison.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Obviously, not for me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Something…somebody left in front the studio. I
just picked it up.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Maybe we can find out whose it is.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Stupid of me…I should’ve left it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Lorna. That’s a name you don’t hear very
much. Lorna. Like the cookie.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Terri and Lorna. Sisters, maybe? Lovers, more
like it. Or…witches. And this bracelet is some sort of talisman.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You have a perverse mind.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Or…perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this
“gift” provides her with an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Maybe you should put it back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What, aren’t you a little curious?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sarah…I don’t know how to put this. This is
our fourth night out, and I feel a lot of pressure…for this to work.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I want it to work, too.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Don’t you think we’re being a
little…methodical about the whole thing? Maybe we should just…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What? Get it over with?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t you think it’s better to be sure of
each other first? To have a little bit of trust?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s not such a strange thing to ask.
Sometimes relationships…overlap. I just need to feel–</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I told you. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You haven’t asked me if I’m seeing
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Is that bad?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s silly, I know, but it makes me feel like
you couldn’t imagine anyone being interested in me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What? You should be flattered I don’t ask. I
respect you enough to assume you’d tell me if you’re involved with
someone.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hmm. Ask me, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I do want to make love tonight.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m just worried that all this talk is going
to kill the spontaneity–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think spontaneity is overrated.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Todd, the light.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Wait. Don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What were you going to say?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I wasn’t going to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You look beautiful–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, don’t say that. Let’s get under the
covers.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let’s go slowly.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh. Oww!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dammit…my foot. I’ve got one of those…what’s
the word?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: A bunion</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not a bunion. A spasm.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Oh, a foot spasm. Here let me–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oww! No, stop! It hurts! I hate this!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nothing, it’s fine, it’s fine. Lemme just
walk it off.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: She has a better-looking body than I
imagined…Breasts are definitely bigger than I thought. You can just
never tell with breasts, can you?…I don’t know what to make of this foot
problem…Maybe she gets a spasm every time she has sex…I’ve heard of
people with problems like that…People who can’t have sex without
laughing, or burping…Oh, God, what if she’s one of them…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I am so embarrassed. Trust me, this doesn’t
happen all the time.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: The thought never crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: She won’t look at me. Why won’t she look at
me?..I’ll bet she’s preoccupied with her foot. She’s praying she won’t
get another spasm, another foot freak-out…She’s being awfully quiet,
too…Why is she so quiet?…Maybe she needs to concentrate…Some women need
to concentrate…I read that in a magazine at the grocery store…That
blonde check-out girl who works there is really cute…I love the way she
says, “Paper or plastic?”…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Todd! Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: These walls, they’re paper-thin. This
building is so poorly built. Everyone can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Is that why you’re so quiet?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, the walls are…What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It’s hard for me to tell if you’re enjoying
this.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Of course, I am. I’m sorry if I’m not vocal
enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s not what I…Sarah, I just want to make
sure I’m doing something right here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There’s no right or wrong way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know. I just want to make sure I’m…you know,
in the ballpark.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Todd, I don’t expect you to do everything
right the first time…Sorry, that didn’t come out the way I meant it…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You didn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, I didn’t say that. I was just…Let’s be
still for a while. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Everyone expects fireworks the first time you
do it. But that’s just a myth.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: A myth. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let’s not be too hard on ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Our expectations were a little high, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: And at the end of the day, sex is only one
part of the picture.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: True. What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know this couple. They had nothing in common
but good sex. They went at it like a pair of rabbits. And guess how long
it lasted? A month. They were hot for each other…but there was nothing
else.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Morning, Pappy. How’s she doing today?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Don’t pay her any mind, Sarah. The
things she says, they get stranger by the day.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: They keep telling me I’m doing fine,
that I’m even improving. Why do they have to lie? At my age? What are
they trying to protect me from?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Maybe they know something you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Like hell.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nan.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: What? One in the morning with coffee.
One at night with cocktails. Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Your story, that’s the one I want to
hear.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wish I had a story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Hmm. The last time there was talk of an
admirer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: All you want is dirt, Nan. Admit it.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: The world is made of dirt, Sarah. So,
please, dish. No detail is too small.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I…I’m sleeping with two different men.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Hmm. Continue.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: One of them is a good man. He’s good for
me.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Like vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sort of. The other one, he can be a complete
ass. A total jerk.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: In other words…he excites you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He does. And I hate it. I hate him. And, on
top of that, I can’t have him.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Can you see your Pappy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He hasn’t moved.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Good. Keep an eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Because I’m going to tell you something
he shouldn’t hear. Something no one knows. Once, I had two lovers. One
was your grandfather. He had prospects, then. He had a car and we drove
everywhere and people would look at us and say, “Now, there goes a
couple.” He never pushed me. He told me he respected my virginity. And I
liked that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t worry. He’s not moving.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: The other man – he was a boy, really –
he had no prospects. And he had no car. And he had no respect…for
anything. He certainly had no respect for my virginity. And I liked
that, too.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: But I had to make a choice. I chose
your grandfather. The day before the wedding, I went to let the other
boy down. Met him by a river where we used to swim. Well, one thing led
to another, and when I returned home that night, I’d left my virginity
back in the tall grass by that river.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: But I did bring something back. A bite
mark. That sonuvabitch left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Did Pappy see it?</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: He did and he didn’t. On the wedding
night – in this house – I managed to squeak by. It was dark. We were
shy. He took me in his arms and said, “I’m glad you waited for me.” In
other words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No small feat.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: It’s an accomplishment. But the next
morning, your Pappy saw it. He demanded an explanation. And, Sarah, do
you know how I got out of that pickle?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You lied.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Damn right. I said, “What, you don’t
remember giving me this?” He said, “No.” And I said, “Well, you were so
fired up last night, it’s a wonder you can remember anything.”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And you’ve never been tempted to…</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: What? Come clean with your Pappy? Why
should I tell him? He had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: It’s mine. Not his.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wonder what became of that boy.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Never saw him again. I don’t regret a
thing, if that’s what you’re wondering.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I was, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Look what I have. I have you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t believe it. You’re actually asking my
opinion. You really want to know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: To tell you the truth, no. I just wanted to
hear your voice. You’ve barely said “boo” to me all morning.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Alright, what do you think of it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’d have to pay me to live in that
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What are they going to think? That’s all that
matters.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: To paraphrase you, this is going to give them
a major hard-on. Not the women, of course.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You haven’t met these women.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The champagne order?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Done. Dom Perignon. Fifteen cases.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Invitations?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A messenger is meeting us at the site with
the proofs.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Have you never heard of the phrase “impulse
control”?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I love it when you’re full of contempt.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: People are starting to notice, Josh. I work
very hard to act completely indifferent toward you. The least you could
do is to keep your hands to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’ve got a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Why don’t I distribute a memo, informing
everyone that you and I are not sleeping together?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you
take me seriously for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Alright, alright. I have another idea.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Let’s just end it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes. I think we should.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Coming?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m going to take the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I can’t put my finger on it…I just don’t feel
it’s happening with us.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You don’t want it work out, that’s what you’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I do. I mean, I did. It’s no one’s fault.
It’s chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You want your pickle?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you want your pickle?!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You know what the problem is? The first night
we went out, we should’ve just fucked. Right away. Without thinking. Two
dumb bunnies. Without any history, any baggage. A pair of blank slates.
Fucking. It could’ve been perfectly meaningless. You want chemistry? The
less you think, the better the chemistry. Less talk, more action.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just not happening for
me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: The least you can do is give me your goddam
pickle.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Guess I’ll be heading back…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You’re angry I called it quits, aren’t you?
You can admit it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. In fact, I want to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For sparing me from the most unhealthy
relationship I’ve ever had in my life. For that, I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Touch�.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you having seconds thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No. I say, let’s make a clean break. Let’s
just walk away from it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let’s seal the deal. Shake.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Alright. Now that we’ve put that behind us,
there’s one problem left.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Where do we put the bed?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, the bed. Let’s put it against this wall.
Away from the morning sun.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wrong. It’s got to go here. So you can see the
hallway.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not enough height for bunk beds.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Why do you assume there will be two
children?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There has to be. They need to keep each other
company.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Definitely not enough space for two people to
cook.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I prefer to eat out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, no. I wouldn’t put the ottoman there.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Where would you put it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It needs to go over…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We have another problem.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: And that would be…?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do we do with the elephant in the
room?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You’re very clever.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We shouldn’t be rude to an elephant.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They can get very annoyed…if you ignore
them.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Josh. The door.</p>
<p><strong>on josh and sarah</strong>: With Sarah’s back against the
door, Josh enters her.</p>
<p><strong>close on sarah</strong>: She looks up. With no roof above
them, she has a brilliant view of…the clouds. They float past as she
thinks–</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I have to tell you, that was the best
“break-up” sex I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It was, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Still dressed in the clothes she wore
earlier. She holds a small paper bag.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sarah…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Pickles. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh. Sawdust. Lots of sawdust at the job
site.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes, I have a problem. I need some…something
to cover up a…Hell, just take a look.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah. You’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can do without the attitude, thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Try concealer. Aisle three.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Just put it on. And call your lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’m reading a stupid article in a stupid
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: If it’s stupid, why read it?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. She’s a bore.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: She’s breaking up with her husband of twenty
years. Said a friend, “Her show’s in syndication, she’s thin, she’s rich
and she wants to play.” Josh dries his hands.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Some poor tree gave its life so we could know
that.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s comforting, reading about these broken
marriages.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s not enough for our marriage to succeed.
Everyone else’s must fail.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Is this going to be one of those nights?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: One of those nights we talk.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No. There’s no need to talk, because there’s
no problem.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’ve been under a lot of stress.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You don’t have to apologize. There’s nothing
wrong with the slump we’re going through. In fact, it’s a good
thing.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Too much passion can ruin a marriage. Look at
Eric and Sylvia. At the beginning, you couldn’t pry them apart. They
were joined at the genitals. And, then…total burn-out. A marriage cannot
sustain that kind of intensity. It’s good for people to grow bored with
each other. That way, they can meet and fall in love again.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: In case you hadn’t noticed…I’m trying to
seduce you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can feel that.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re welcome to reciprocate.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: To seduce…to be seduced, there needs to be an
element of surprise. I know all your moves. You know mine. How can there
be any surprise?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Rub my feet.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I think we should have an affair.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: With each other.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: That makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You pick me up at a bar…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: And, what? Pretend I don’t know you?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having
an affair with a college boy.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: When I met you, you were a college boy.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very
unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock. As I recall, it turns
out rather badly for her.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Alright. Bad example.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Actors pretend. That’s what they do. I’m not
an actor. And I love you the way you are.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Pretending to be strangers is not going to
solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Who said there was a problem?</p>
<p><strong>josh’s pov</strong>: Through the crowd he spots Sarah,
entering with her date – Todd.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Your lovely assistant is here.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I don’t ask her about her personal life.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hey, you two. Todd, this is my boss Josh, and
his wife Gwen.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sarah’s told me a lot about you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sarah, you look great. You’ve been keeping my
boy on his best behavior?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s a dirty job, but somebody’s got to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I know he asks to go above and beyond the call
of duty.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He can be tough.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: But fair.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Josh, I’m trying to thank Sarah for all the
extra attention she gives you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We should really have you over for dinner,
Sarah. It’s been too long. You can bring…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Todd.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sorry. I’m hopeless when it comes to
names.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Especially after two glasses of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hey, I’m still working on the first, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Living together? No.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ve only known each other a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You two seem to fit. It only took me a few
days to know with Josh. In fact, I knew after the first date.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You knew what?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: That he was the one for me.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well, it was the cheapest date I’ve ever been
on.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I was broke.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Do you know the Chinese place on Third? That
little hole-in-the-wall?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know it. Used to be a cool dive. Now it’s
ultra-hip and overpriced.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Really? I think our first dinner cost a grand
total of ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Gwen loves to dissect our first date.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: It was a momentous night. Babe, we should
really go back there.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Gwen, why don’t you continue your stroll down
memory lane while I drink? Todd, you up for it?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m fine, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: So…Sarah’s an attractive girl.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You two serious?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: She wants to play the field, right?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, that’s not it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I see. You want to fuck around.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: C’mon, we’re guys. I know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was
on the fence about Sarah. I liked her, but I didn’t think we were in a
good groove. Then, a couple weeks ago, her grandmother died. Things
changed.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It wasn’t unexpected, but Sarah took it really
hard. So where did that leave me? I was ambivalent about things, right?
But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat. I had to be there for
her. Completely. And, ready or not, our relationship became…a real
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You know, I wasn’t ready to be that involved
with anybody. I don’t know…Death has a funny way of making you get
outside yourself.</p>
<p><strong>josh’s pov</strong>: Gwen is still chatting with Sarah. Gwen
makes eye contact with Josh and sends him a warm smile.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You missed the on-ramp.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Somewhere we need to go first.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We don’t have to do this tonight.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes, we do.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We can’t go in here. Everything’s
different.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: That’s okay. We’re different, too.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sarah’s a very interesting girl. Did you know
she’s training for the marathon?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I don’t want to talk about Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What do you want to talk about, then?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I want to talk about me…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: …and what a fool I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I thought if we came here tonight we
could…start again.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re supposed to wait–</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can’t wait. I have to know.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hmm. That’s what I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The last cookie. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No. You open it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It’s blank.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Blank…in bed. That’s disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No, it’s perfect. Blank…no problems, no
history, nothing…in bed.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: By the way, I didn’t get your name.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: My name is Gail. Gail Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, Gail, I’m not usually this forward on a
first date, may I take you to my car and ravish you?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hmm. On one condition.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: That you tell me your name.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, I thought everyone knew my name. I’m Bill
Gates. Billionaire.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Is it true what they say, Bill, about
billionaires? That all the wealth is just a way to compensate…for
size?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: People are jealous.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I can imagine. It must be so lonely at the
top.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What do you think I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We’re not in a bed.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You shouldn’t read fortune cookies too
literally.</p>
<p><strong>close on josh</strong>: As he makes love to his wife, he
thinks–</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: …Can anyone see us?…Is anyone looking?…Why
should it bother you? You’re alone…with your wife…That’s the way it’s
supposed to be…You know every inch of her…every smell…every sigh…every
freckle…the shape of her ass…the mole under her nipple…the whole history
of her body…And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can
succeed…in imagining…she’s someone you don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Color. That’s the problem with this room, it
needs color. Think of…the vibrant colors of Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Personally, Haiti does nothing for me. When
your father and I were there – this was before you were born, I almost
died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn’t want anything to remind me
of that trip.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Alright. I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Because you’re not sure?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No, I’m sure. I’m sure he’s sleeping with
her.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What? You think I should just forget about
it?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Mother, don’t you think honesty is essential
in a marriage?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: It depends. It can be quite detrimental.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Alright. Confront him. You know where it
will get you. Your whole marriage will unravel, and you’ll have nothing.
All the things you take for granted – month-long vacations in St. Lucia
– they’ll disappear. You’ll be a divorced woman in her late 30s.
Lonely.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why did I invite you over? You make me feel
like shit.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: The machine can get it.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I don’t monitor calls. It makes me feel like
I’m hiding in my own home.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Gwen, this is David Warren. Hopefully, a
welcome voice from your past. My show’s on hiatus and I’m in town for
the weekend. I’d love to catch up. Are you free for coffee…or
something?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Pick up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I have no idea what you’re up to…I hope life
is treating you well. I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend
that you’re still married. Congratulations. If you want, give me a call.
I’m crashing at my sister’s. The number is – hold on– the number is
235-4511. Hope to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: College.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Have you ever seen his show? It’s absolutely
dreadful. I never miss it.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: If Josh isn’t home, I’ll watch it.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Hmm. It’s Kismet, then.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: A brief liaison with an old flame. The
perfect way to deal with your anger.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re insane. You’re an insane mother.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: It’ll be good for your self-esteem.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants
to have coffee?</p>
<p><strong>david’s voice</strong>: …on hiatus and I’m in town for the
weekend. Are you free for coffee…or something?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: “Coffee…or something.” He’s flirting, admit
it. Coffee…or something.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: He’s stammering. He’s nervous. He’s calling
out of the blue!</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: You’re wrong. I’m right, and I’m going. But
take a tip from someone who’s been there. Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.
You have a chance to level the playing field.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You’re right. We could use some more color in
the living room.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I said you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: About more color in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh. I’m glad you think so.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: And how many nights will you be staying
with us?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We do have a two-night minimum.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Then…two.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’d like to pay in cash.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: That won’t be a problem. We just need a
credit card imprint for your incidentals…</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: …which we tear up when you check
out.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Will you be needing more than one
key?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Two, please.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: I’m still reeling. It was the most
humbling experience of my life. Getting raked over the coals by a bunch
of sixteen-year old drama students! At my own alma mater!</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’m surprised they weren’t all over you.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: They were, with knives drawn.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Basically, why am I working on a piece
of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS when I should be doing Shakespeare or
Chekhov?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Compliments from the table in the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: See? Those women are happy you’re not doing
Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Gwen. You look great. You haven’t
changed a bit.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I don’t think I’m MALIBU NIGHTS material.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Those women! Walking boob jobs.
They’re appalling.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You look like you enjoy kissing them.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: It’s very simple. I close my eyes and
imagine I’m kissing someone else.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Hmm. Someone else in particular?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: If she’s as tan as you, I don’t want to hear
about it.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Here, take a look…</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: What’s wrong with this picture,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well…Let’s start with the man, upper left.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Andy. My partner. And the best thing
that’s ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Okay. And the boy?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Eric. He’s Andy’s son from a marriage
that – needless to say – didn’t work. Andy came out when Eric was just
five. Great kid.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And when did you…?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Come out? About fifteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No. But fifteen years ago…That was right
after–</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: You and me.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Was I the last woman?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Was I that bad?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: No, you were fantastic. I was
completely confused.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Nothing. I’m very happy for you. And, I have
to confess, I’m relieved.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh – what the hell – we’re friends, right?</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to
get together to have a…</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You know…for old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And, frankly, I wasn’t looking forward to
turning you down. Which I would have, of course. Had you…asked. Which
you’re not, because you’re…you’re…</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Married.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>david warren</strong>: Happily.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Would you pour me a little more, David?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Can I help you, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’d like to check out.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Was there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Yes. I was stood up…by the past.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry. We won’t charge you for the
room.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No, you don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Yes. I do.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Shall I close out the account?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No. I need the room after all.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You’re in luck. I was just about to take
my break.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Something from the mini-bar?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: How’s the air conditioning?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Shall I pull down the covers?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Do you want to know my name?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You’re shaking.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You don’t even know me.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: We have nothing in common.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: That’s where you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Thank you for taking care of the room.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Your welcome.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: …And now the score is tied…Oh my God, what
will I tell my mother? I did it with a desk clerk. Hardly the affair to
remember…Of course, she will disapprove. “Is English even his first
language? This is your idea of a liaison? Your idea of leveling the
playing field? You don’t even know the boy’s name–”</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What? You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Nothing, it’s just–</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sorry, I just…I didn’t think you’d be named
David.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk #2</strong>: There’s a woman waiting to see you.
She’s been here for half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: You weren’t going to return my calls.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Don’t you have more important things to do?
Picking flowers, honeymoon reservations…</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Is there somewhere we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Is there somewhere we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s wrong with here?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Privately.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But here, I won’t be tempted to raise my
voice or do something rash. That’s the first lesson of hotel management.
Never lose your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is. Not that I
plan to go into hotel management. I don’t have ambitions in that
direction. Or any direction, if I recall you correctly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rosie, you’d better leave. Before I get
myself fired.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Yo, fiddler on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Discipline. Always a struggle.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: I hear you. For instance, it takes a
certain discipline to know that when you’re working at the hotel, when
you’re on the clock…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Throughout the film, we’ve heard this string
quartet as underscore. Now…we meet the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie.</strong>: She’s been waiting.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I want you to be there on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: You told me we’d always be friends.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: You’re an important part of my life, David.
There’s so much history between us. I don’t want to trash it simply
because–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because what? Because you’re getting
married?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rosie, I want you to be happy. I do. And
someday, we’ll be friends. Someday, we’ll all go out to dinner. The four
of us.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: The four of us?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sure. Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale
imitation of you I can dig up to be my date.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And the check will come and Jerry will pick
up the tab and I’ll protest, but not too much. Then, you’ll give me a
kiss on the cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too
long. And we’ll say, “It was great to see you.” And it will be great to
see you…</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: We’ve got a few more things to
cover. The photos. There’s a courtyard behind the church. It’s a popular
backdrop. Our photographer says the light is gorgeous. We need twenty
minutes before the ceremony for singles.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I know. It is an election year.</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: Exactly what he said.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: Right. The guest list. We have a
few more no-show’s.</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Bennett send their
regrets. Also, Ms. Rothman will no be attending.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Oh. David Freeman. He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s not?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: No. He’s not.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: After all that shit you put me through, now
he’s not even coming.</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: So, if there are any
last-minute–</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Yes, I talked to him. And I…</p>
<p><strong>wedding planner</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I talked to David. And…I uninvited him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I told him it wasn’t right. I told him he
shouldn’t be at our wedding.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: When did you decide this?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I don’t know…I just realized I don’t want
our wedding to be about where I’ve been. I want it to be about where you
and I are going.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: He was disappointed–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Of course he was. He’s still in love with
you.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: But he understands. I drew the line,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I did it for us.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Were you sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. I was.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Liar. You’re practicing. I can hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>david’s pov</strong>: Rosalie – on her cell – waves to him
from the sidewalk, three stories below.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: It’s so sad. Why do you always play sad
songs?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t write ’em, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Please let me in.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: You don’t trust me?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I’m going to wait here for one minute.
Sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Then, I’m gone. You won’t see me again.</p>
<p><strong>david’s pov</strong>: Rosalie sits on the front steps.
Stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If I go down those stairs…it will only lead
to one place…right back here…the two of us…a short, brilliant moment…one
more to add to the gallery…then, empty-handed again, with nothing to
show for it but an emotional hangover…I’m not going to open this door…
Discipline… Like the man said, don’t fuck the guests…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve got nothing to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Fine. I’ll talk…</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: The reason I won’t just leave you alone is
not because I’m “confused.” My feelings are perfectly clear. I know you
find it incomprehensible that I can love Jerry and love you. And that
one love has nothing to do with the other. But it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Rose…</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is bullshit. I can’t spell it out any
more plainly. It’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because I can’t be this close to you…and not
want to touch you.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s…it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: And if I can’t do that, I don’t want to be
your friend. Not now. Not ever.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Don’t be so mean.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The bottom line is…If I’m with you, I have to
touch you, to kiss you. That doesn’t work for friends, does it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: When I’m not with you – this is more than you
need to know…If I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.
No one else. Just you.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What do you mean “we”? This is your
problem.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Stop…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have to say good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I don’t know how…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Should we stop?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: David, will you hand me my shampoo? It’s in
my purse.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the
fruit of thy womb Jesus…Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death, Amen…Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed
be the fruit of…</p>
<p><strong>on rosalie</strong>: She nudges him. He doesn’t stir. Rosalie
sits at the foot of the bed. She grabs the remote and “un-mutes” the
sound.</p>
<p><strong>expert</strong>: …And the change is not just physical. You’ll
be amazed how quickly your whole outlook will–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Late.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It is late. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Oh. The girls. Wedding talk. We could’ve
gone on all night.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: We need to make love now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay…why now?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I can’t explain it. We just need to make
love now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I just need to fix this moment in my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I love you. Totally. Completely. I don’t
want to spend another minute of my life without you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re forgetting something.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t you think…</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: No, I don’t. Let’s not use it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If you’re ready, so am I.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Talk to me…</p>
<p><strong>flash!</strong>: rOSALIE</p>
<p><strong>flash…flash!</strong>: rOSALIE</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: A lot of young couples prefer “husband and
wife” to the traditional “man and wife.” Personally, I don’t feel the
phrase “man and wife” gives the woman a diminutive status. But I leave
the choice in your hands. Do you have a–</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Husband and wife. Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: That could be tough. For him.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Remember, this is God’s house. And there
will be prominent people here as well. Not to mention the press. So,
let’s keep things on the up-and-up.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Here we are. Bahia Gold. Two hundred a
box.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You don’t have to do this, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: If I can’t come to the bachelor party, I
want to be there in spirit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I remember my bachelor night. Frankly, I
wish I didn’t. Not a night I’m particularly proud of…I’ll leave it at
that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why are you sharing this?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Reminiscing. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Or warning me.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Nonsense. I know you. You won’t make an ass
out of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s a key.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I can’t accept this.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Uh-huh. I get it. This is Rosalie’s domain.
She should have a say in where you two settle down. But don’t worry, you
won’t be forcing her hand. Know why? Because she’s going to love it.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Let’s ring these babies up.</p>
<p><strong>best friend</strong>: Alright, my man. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do I have a choice?</p>
<p><strong>best friend</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then, I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>best friend</strong>: The guys pitched in for this…</p>
<p><strong>best friend</strong>: So go up there and get our money’s
worth.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why am I stopping?…There’s a hot girl waiting
on the other side of the door…Why worry? Everyone cuts you slack for
this kind of thing…This is supposed to happen…It’s a tradition, a
time-honored ritual…Losing your tooth, losing your virginity, losing the
championship…If I walk through this door, what am I losing? Nothing…My
father was here, and his father was here, and his father’s father was
here, hand on the door…What am I waiting for…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short
skirt. As fetching as ever.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: You must be the groom.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: The guys were right. You’re a looker.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Did they also tell you I don’t usually do
this kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: All the better. I like challenges.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Getting married tomorrow, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Love, honor, and obey. That’s the drill,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes. Tomorrow, I take the vows.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Tomorrow…So, technically, this doesn’t
count.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: You can’t break a vow you haven’t taken, can
you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You sound like my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I’ve done my share of lawyers. They spend
most of the hour negotiating the tip.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Something bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know if I should be doing this.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Want my philosophy? If we don’t make mistakes
now and then, how are we ever going to learn from them?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Now you sound like my priest.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I’ve done a few of them, too.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Priests?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Lousy tippers. They spend most of the hour
feeling bad about what they’re doing. But they do it anyway. Then, they
shortchange you on the tip. One of them absolved me once, before he
left. That’s something, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Who are the best tippers?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: The guys who can least afford it. Guys with
families.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And the worst?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Hands-down. Politicians.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Politicians?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Sure. Both parties. I don’t discriminate.
Besides, a penis doesn’t know from politics. A penis is the most
politically incorrect part of the body. It has a simple agenda.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Stop it. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I can’t…I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Hey, it’s no sweat. I get paid either
way.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, you don’t understand. I can’t fucking go
through with it!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>on lorna</strong>: She shakes her head – she’s completely
nonplussed.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: That was smart. Now, you’re bleeding.
Here…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: C’mon. Let’s sit down.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She wants to have a baby. That’s the way it’s
supposed to be, right?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: My parents approve of her. Her parents
approve of me. Everybody approves…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: What’s wrong with a little approval?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s my whole life. My whole goddam
carrot-and-stick-life. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been chasing
after this person or that person’s approval. Playing one role, then
another. Then another! The good student. The good son. The industrious
boy. Good grades. High ambitions. Pats on the back. Handshakes from
people who matter! The good boyfriend, getting on his knees and
proposing to the good girlfriend. The dutiful bachelor, receiving the
traditional blow-job from a…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve lost count of all the roles, there’s so
many of them.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I don’t see what the big deal is. I play
roles all the time.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And you want to do that your entire life? You
can’t…you…</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Lorna. And I’ll do whatever the hell I
want.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, I can’t live somebody else’s version of
my life anymore. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Sure. I do.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Here’s your chance.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: It’s not too far a drop to the lawn. You have
gas in your car? Then, go. It’s the first day of the rest of your
life…Go. I promise you, this opportunity will not come around twice.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The suburbs at night. Cozy, warm-lit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna’s pov</strong>: She watches him hit the ground, hobble
across the lawn, and get into his car. And he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: See? Easy.</p>
<p><strong>lorna’s pov</strong>: Behind the counter lies a crumpled
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It’s yesterday’s. Morning paper should be
here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I just want the crossword puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: There’s a catch, alright.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Hello…It’s the oldest condition known to man.
Cold feet.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: You’re wrong. I’m telling you he’s two states
away by now.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: If you’re wrong, you’re paying for drinks
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Well, what do you know…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Told you we should’ve dressed up.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: C’mon…we’re going inside.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What for? Wait…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Lorna, we shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Excuse me, could you tell me who’s getting
married in…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m sorry. Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Yeah. You don’t remember me?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You must be thinking of somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Right. I must be thinking of someone else.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Nothing, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Alright, alright. I slipped.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Slipped? You broke the cardinal rule of the
trade.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: What is this? Hooking For Dummies? C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>lorna’s pov</strong>: The front pews are packed, all eyes
focussed on the wedding party at the altar. Jerry and Rosalie face the
priest, who blesses the ring.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The wedding ring is a powerful symbol. It is
a circle, with no beginning and no end. It is also the circle that
encloses your love for each other–</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’ll bet that dress is Vera Wang.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and
to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have
and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Then, by the power invested in me by Christ,
Our Lord, I now pronounce you husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You’re crying, I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Ladies, this event is strictly for
invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: We’re with the groom’s party.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Ma’am…Let’s not do this. You’re not
with the groom.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: She had his cock in her mouth last night.
Doesn’t that count?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: I don’t know why he came back.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Guess you’ll never know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Remember the guy I told you about – the
writer?</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: Yeah. He said he wanted to immortalize you.
What a line.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: He’s been steady work. Every Tuesday for the
past month. Well, get this. Yesterday, he called and asked me out.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: On a date?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Yeah. A date.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: A non-paying date.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No money will be exchanged. You want to hear
the weird part? I said yes.</p>
<p><strong>lorna</strong>: You’re right. That is weird.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna.</p>
<p><strong>what lorna sees</strong>: A Man finishing a cigarette. He
catches Lorna looking his way. A Woman comes up behind the Man and
casually embraces him. The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling
the curtains closed.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: C’mon, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>on lorna</strong>: She lingers at the curb for a moment,
pondering her next move.</p>
