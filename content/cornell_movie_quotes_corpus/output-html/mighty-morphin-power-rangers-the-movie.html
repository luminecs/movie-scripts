<p><strong>voice</strong>: In a time of great strife, a legendary
interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove
to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil. with
the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out
six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an
unstoppable fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes
could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as “Zords”. while
the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous
exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title… The
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.</p>

<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ll be at the Observatory Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: That’s right - Ryan’s Comet.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: We should throw a little comet shindig.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Any excuse for a party.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: The Eagle has landed.</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: The earth was hurtling toward us at seven

<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi ! Our thermionic-sensors
have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is
in GRAVE danger!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Danger from what?</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Six thousand years ago a morphological being
known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror.
Finally, a rebel factor known as the “Order of the Meledon” lured him
into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: In a place that came to be known as Angel
Grove.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!
You must return it to the depths. or anyone should open it and Ivan is
released!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: To assist you I have retro-fitted your
helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are
dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Another Saturday night and I’m traipsing
around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS! My mother warned me this
would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think
about throwing in the towel. Why didn’t I listen to her?!</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: That’s a good question.</p>
<p><strong>first security guard</strong>: Uh… Kurt… you might wanna take
a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: No need to wake him. In fact, why don’t you
take a little nap yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: After two thousand years of searching… I have
finally found you.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Yo, earth to Bigfoot!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Mordant’s my second cousin three times
removed on my mother’s side. He`s just visiting for the summer.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well put a muzzle on him!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What… you spent two thousand years looking for
this tub of</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: Don’t you ever have anything nice to say?!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Well, if I did I certainly wouldn’t say it to
you!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Boss.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: For your information this is not just your
average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot !</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’re trying to tell me there`re different
levels of snot?!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Boss.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ahhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen… the OOZE is back!!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He’s so cute.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is
good and decent. It is a supreme honor to finally meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: How can I ever repay you?</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: Do you recall the name… Zordon of Eltare?</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Seems to ring a bell.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil
may once again reign</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Finally, a real man.</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Here’s his address.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: It’s like a freeway. How long have you been
locked up? !</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: We shall leave you to weave your wicked
ways.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Now we go out on the town. First dinner, then
dancing, then –</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: What is that odious stench?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Smell’s like… TEENAGERS!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his
teleporting calculations.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Anybody see anything?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … Let’s take a look over there.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: You had me scared there.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You haven’t by any chance seen a …
morphological being lurking around?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: The only thing I’ve seen is you
teenagers. And you know… if there’s one thing in the world I reeeeally
hate….</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: It’s TEENAGERS</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: GroSS!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: You’re too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE!</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Well, pack your bags cause we’re sending you
back where you came from!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has
changed in six thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: we’re not just teenagers, raisin-
head.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ooooh, where’s my autoqraph book?.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Power Rangers, huh? So Zordon is still using a
bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work. And speaking of rats…</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: From this moment forth, the world as you know
it SHALL CEASE TO</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s take these beasts!!</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were
too late! Ivan is on his way here!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center
without a power coin!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Well… ALMOST nobody.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Gee… pretty fancy-shmancy. I guess if you
invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty
nice.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Welcome to Wiener World. May I take your
order, please?</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: You haven’t changed, Ooze. You’re still
picking on creatures smaller than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Put a cork in it “Z” . Ten minutes out of the
egg and I’m already listening to one of your lectures.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: It worked for six thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Don’t remind me!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Do you have any idea what it’s like to be
cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years? It’s BORING! Not to
mention I’ve had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance! But now the
tables are turned. Now…</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: … it’s time to pay the PIPER!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Oh, the things that I have missed. The BLACK
PLAGUE!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: And now, finally, I have the strength to
DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: I’ve got a NEWS flash for you</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: You put your left probe in, you put your
left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about.
You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: RAT breath!!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Somebody needs a shave.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let’s teach these vermin a few manners.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Activating Power Beam!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Everybody stay alert.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hold it…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Activating Audio Enhancer!</p>
<p><strong>sound effect</strong>: We hear silence and then… a RASPY
BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They’re on the other side of that wall.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Anybody see them?</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Activating Power Scope!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Hey, handsome!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’ve got company.</p>
<p><strong>saba</strong>: Rats! I hate rats!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bad move, Willard!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Coming through!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Target Neutralized?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Raptor-Ribbon!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Now you see `em.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Now you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Not the brightest of beasts.</p>
<p><strong>saba</strong>: Na na na na na!</p>
<p><strong>saba</strong>: Fried mice, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Alpha, come in!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’d better get back.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on, guys…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Guys!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Alpha, are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: I’ll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG
toa!!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He must’ve blown an anitromic
demodulator!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: … What’s happening to him?’</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Outside of his time warp he’s aging at a
vastly acellerated rate!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: We have to help him!</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … Rangers… thank goodness you’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We have to get you back inside your time
warp.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: I’m afraid that’s impossible… The power has
been destroyed. It’s gone… The Zords, the weapons… all of it. The Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers are no more.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Zordon… you can’t leave us. Ever since you
came into our lives… you’ve been like another father `to us all.-</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … You must be strong… Ivan almost overthrew
the planet once… and now I’m afraid he has the strength to see his
scheme through.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: what’re we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not
like them, Sam-I-am!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Thanks, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There has to be something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come on, guys, think!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Alpha. Is there any way we can defeat this
monster? Any way at all?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: … Perhaps there is a way… I have heard
tales of another power.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: … They say that somewhere beyond the
Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond
all comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How can we get to it?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: As the legend goes, the power is impossible
to obtain.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: We have to try, Alpha. It’s our only
hope.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: It’s far too dangerous. Zordon would never
allow it.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: If we don’t try, Zordon won’t survive!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If Ivan Ooze isn’t stopped, nobody will
survive.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi. The legend speaks of a
Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos… This is the only person
who knows the secrets of the power.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: How can we reach Phaedos?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Zordon’s going to have my orbicular
spheroids when he hears out about this!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: This is an emergency reserve of morphonic
emissions. It should be enough to get -you there.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: There is one problem. I only have enough
reserve to send you Phaedos… I can’t bring you back.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So how do we get back?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: … You’ll have to pray that the legends are
true.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: You’re sure you want to do this?! The
Rangers share purposeful looks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s our only hope.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Safe journey, Rangers!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi. They’re DOOMED!!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: According to the TX Tracker, they’re headed
for Phaedos.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: I’m gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not
gonna know what hit him!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Hi, honey, I’m home !</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN! The Rangers
are going after the Great Power I thought you said this guy was the
Master of Disaster? He’s nothing but a slime- infested, jelly-bellied
blob of –</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: How dare you?! Nobody shuts up Rita but
me!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Sorry, slick, there’s been a slight’change of
plans. The “booger man” is taking over.</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Zedd’s gonna kick this snotball into next
week!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ooooh, that tickles!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: My turn.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: This is all your fault! If you’d taken me out
tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would’ve happened.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Now you have a choice, either serve me, or
join those insufferable cheesedongs.</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: We never liked the cheesedongs in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Couldn’’t stand them – low-class all the
way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It’s like having a
conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to mention…</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Gasunteidt.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find
the Power Rangers… and TEAR THEM APART!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Mordant, go with them and report back to
me!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: You know boss, I’d really like to help out
but I’ve got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space
trave–</p>
<p><strong>zedd</strong>: Isn’t this just TYPICAL! We finally do
somebody a good turn and just look what happens!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: From now on it’s E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Everybody okay?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Where’ s BILLY? !</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi! The filamentary transistors
have malfunctioned!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Why you low-frequency, battery operated
–</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: This puddle thing is really getting on my
nerves.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Welcome to beautiful downtown Phaedos.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: … Incredible…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let’s see if we can find this Master
warrior.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Taking over the world is one thing. It’s
finding good help to run it for you that’s the killer.</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: You want me to place a few calls?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: No need. I’m going to use the young minds of
Angel Grove.</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: No offense, boss, but they might find you a
little disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Yes, well, I suppose you’d know a little
something about that. Not to worry. I’ll ever so gently lure them in and
mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them …
than with a little Ivan’s Ooze?!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: But boss, what about their parents?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ah, the old and doddering. I’m going to
SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE’S. And then I’ll put
them to work rebuilding my empire.</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: I understand you’re looking for a few new
assistants.</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: Well put your mind to rest `cause now you’ve
got the best.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: What is this?! I advertised for brilliant and
good looking assistants!</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: Hi, I’m brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: And I’m Little-Bo-Peep.</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: Bulk… why don’t we give Mr. Peep here a
chance to think it over?</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: A stellar idea, Skull.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Not so fast, greaseballs.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: You’ll have to do.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I was just thinking about Zordon…
everything we’ve been through together.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You know, meeting Zordon… teaming up with you
guys, it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to
all of us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … He’s gonna make it, guys.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’ll get this warrior… save Zordon… and send
that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: #0!@!#!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: What’s the matter with you woodpeckers!
Take this guy out!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: The Tengu Warriors my butt! The Tengu
TURKEYS is more like it!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Hey, aren’t you bird-brains forgetting
something?!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Watch the meathooks!!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Wow! That was amazing for such a little
dude!</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: You’re trespassing. Now state your
business.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re looking for the Master Warrior. Do you
know where we can find him?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: The Master Warrior doesn’t entertain
visitors -</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: But we have to find him. Our leader Zordon
is dying.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Zordon?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: How did this happen?!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The lady asked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Huh … Oh, uh, we re, ah…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: He was attacked by this horrific being –
Ivan Ooze.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Ivan Ooze is free?! We are all in mortal
danger!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Let’ s go.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Kind of bossy, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round
and feast your eyes. This ain’t sludge and this ain’t guck… this is the
one and only Ivan’s Ooze! Yesireebob. It’s ooey, gooey and even kind of
chewy. But best of all it’s</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: Here you go! No pushing!</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: There’s enough for everybody!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So where’d this guy come from?</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: Uh… that’s classified, top secret,
confidential, undercover information.</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: If we told you – we’d have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>wizard</strong>: Come on, come all – it’s an COZE</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Is this… food!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: They’re called squirbs.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Mine seems to be a little undercooked.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Add a few dried weevils and you’ll never
know the difference.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: … Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but
we really don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: What do you know of the Great Power?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Only that we need it to defeat Ivan
Ooze.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: It is said that to those who possess the
Power… all things are possible.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where did it originate?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: In another time, another dimension. It was
brought here long ago by the “Nathadians”, a people who are now all but
extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power
and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all
over the Universe have tried to obtain it… ALL have perished.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: So how can we get to it?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The only way to obtain the power is to
achieve the highest state of being…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And how do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti. It
is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. It
is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Look, Zordon doesn’t have much longer to
live. And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack. We
don’t have TIME for this.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: You don’t understand. If you do not have the
Ninjetti, the power will destroy you. To reach the Monolith we must
traverse the Neola jungle. We will train today, and set out on foot
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Snoggle, you watch your language!</p>
<p><strong>snoggle</strong>: Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>snoggle</strong>: Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: He wants to know if you’d like a cube of
sugar in your tea.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Ah… sure.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Ah… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: … Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: In the language of the Nathadians, “Nin”
stands for “man”, “jetti” stands for “animal”. Ninjetti - man and
animal, together as one. Now, put your hands inside the flame.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: It will not harm you.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Wow. Sand.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Now tell me… what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and
bold.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Stylin’!</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: I see… an Ape.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I see… a fox</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and
swift.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I think its some kind of bird.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and
sublime.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s gotta be a frog.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Adam, you are the Frog, quick as
lightning.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s… an eagle?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Look closer.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … A falcon?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of
the Sky.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: I… am the sole living descendant of the
“Nathadians”. Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and
mental training known to man and animal.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dad… ??!</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: You seen my parents?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I can’t find my dad either.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>wild kid</strong>: Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That guy was the student body President</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The crane maintains it’s agility through the
perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Let’s see you do it .</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Snoggle, we don’t have time for you to show
off</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The ape is strong, but more importantly it
is flexible and free.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Who is this lady?</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Here goes!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The wolf relies on it’s enhanced senses to
guide it… He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot
smell.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The frog remains still and silent while it
assesses its target… then strikes out in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Show off.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.
Nothing can uproot it.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Girl, you’ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The falcon never struggles with the air, but
rather becomes one with it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You can do this. You can do this. You can do
this…</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the
Rangers…</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: I told them it was too dangerous, but they
wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … We must try to communicate with them.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Perhaps if I could locate a
vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink.</p>
<p><strong>alpha</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Each of you must reach deep within and draw
upon your natural instincts… Only then will you know the way of the
Ninjetti. Rest for a few hours. We will continue at daybreak.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: So where are we supposed to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>snoggle</strong>: Buhph nghujr.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: That guy’s cruisin’ for a bruisin’.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I can hardly walk…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I’ve never been this sore in my life.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do you guys really think we can pull this
off?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe if we had more time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … I wonder… We’ve been relying on our Morphin
Powers for so long… maybe we’ve forgotten how to rely on ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We should get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says… STOP!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Simon says… stand on one foot!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Simon says…</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Quack like a’duck!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: It just slipped out.</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: You didn’t say “Simon says”.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: This is the Iast time I use parents for
anything!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Let’s pick it up here! I’ve got a schedule to
keep. In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Hey, boss!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: What kind of landing was that?! These
clowns are a menace to the sky</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: How did you fare?</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Oh, it couldn’t’ve gone better. The Power
Rangers didn’t know what hit them .</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: That’s right. And then we threw one of them
off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: So they’ve been destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: “Basically”.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: What do you mean “basically”?</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Well… we were about to finish them off…
when this huge monster came out of nowhere!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Okay, maybe he wasn’t so huge. But you
should’ve seen the size of his STICKS</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Did these sticks make a whistling sound?</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome
she-devil of a WITCH!!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea
leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be
OBLITERATED!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: What’re you talking about?! It wasn’t my
fault! You’re the featherbrains that let them get away!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich
the evil of my creatures by tenfold!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to
victorious battle!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Where does he come up with this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos,
FEAST YOURSELVES UPON</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How the heck?!…</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: You have been visited by the animal spirits…
they have given you their blessing.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Thank you! Please! You’re too kind. Finally. a
little appreciation where it’s deserved.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We love you Ivan!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Right back at ya!- Now, WHO MISSES
SCHOOL?!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Can I have a word with you guys? What’s really
going on here?! Where are everybody’s parents?</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: Like we said before, that’s classified, top
secret…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of
garbage all over them.</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: Well, why didn’t you say so?!</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: They’re at the World Center Construction
Site.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh. OOZE RULES!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Dulcea… how do you and Zordon know each
other?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping
Force known as the “Order of the Meledan”. Zordon was widely regarded as
the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend… If it wasn’t
for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is
today.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: So… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Over time our enemies were defeated… I
returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere.
Until you kids showed up, I hadn’t heard from him for centuries.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: He was always an inspiration…</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: This is why I’m taking you to the Nathadian
Monolith. That is why I’m teaching you the Ninjetti. If Zordon dies…
then a piece of all of us dies… and the force of good within the
Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow.</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: As soon as we’ve taken over the world I’m
gonna change my name to Sir Mordant. Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: How about Major Moron?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: How about the two of you shut Up and pay
attention!!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: What is THAT!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the
barbaric</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dad…?!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We have to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mr. kelman</strong>: Dig… dig… dig…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dad?!… It’s me, Fred!</p>
<p><strong>mr. kelman</strong>: Dig… dig… dig…</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Gotchya!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Just shut your gap!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: Did I say anything?</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one
of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to
within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … I just pray we’re not too late.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Let’s give it a whirl.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Angel Grove Police have been fielding
hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing
gersons continues to grow</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ai, yi, yi, yi, yi</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Are you bored with your work? Are you bored
with your family Are you bored with your 1ife Well, come on down to Ooze
City and LET’S GET STICKY!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The Monolith is there in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: This is as far as I can take you.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You’re leaving us?!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: I have taught you all that I know. Now you
must achieve the Ninjetti on your own.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: It is said that once you’ve reached the
power… you have only ten triacs to release it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s a Triac?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: About twenty seconds in your time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And how do we release the power?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: The legend goes that you release the power
with the power.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What does that mean!</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: That is a question that even I cannot
answer. Remember, ten triacs. After that something bad will happen.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Like…how bad?</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: They say the power will throw off a
super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and
bits of charred bone.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: That’s pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>dulcea</strong>: Ka’Alabas tor nartu En’Kata-Tay. May your
animals watch over you.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Finally, after centuries of waiting, my
Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: Oh, man, that was a rental!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Mordant… let the ooze flow!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Goldar… the roof!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Looks like a fine day for raising</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Bullseye!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: LIFE!! Give my creatures LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>mordant</strong>: This guy is the King!</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: What’re you waiting for??…</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>goldar</strong>: You forgot to say ’Simon says.”</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Man, these are the last guys I wanted to
see.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Whadda we do now?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s the only way to the Monolith…</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: We can take these guys!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The frog silently assesses its target, then
strikes out…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yo, Tweety!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.
Nothing can uproot it.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Bye, bye birdy.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!</p>
<p><strong>feet through the air – he intercepts the tengu and they

<p><strong>ivan</strong>: And his trimetallic partner in crime…
SCORPITRON!!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: That should do it. we won’t be able to hear
them, but they SHOULD be able to hear us. Here goes.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: … the Mayor has declared a state of
emergency and asked that the city be immediately evacuated. He has
reiterated the need for everyone to remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Angel Grove has never before known
such a crisis and we can now only pray for the swift arrival of the
Power Rangers!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Ay, yi, yi, yi!</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: … Alpha, keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: … The Nathadian Monolith…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I guess these guys weren’t so lucky.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: We’ve come all this way for a rock wall?!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There should be a way to open it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: … Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Release the power with the power.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Not that kind of power.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: … There has to be something we’re
missing.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: It can’t end like this…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What NOW!</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Rangers… Ivan has invaded the city… time is
running out…</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Each of you are now in possession of
miraculous skills… but only when the six become one will you have the
strength to harness the Great Power.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Six become one… the combined forces of the
Ninjetti.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: Strength in numbers!!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I am the wolf, cunning and swift!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I am the crane, agile and sublime!</p>

<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the
Sky!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: What HAPPENED?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where are we?!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Of course! The power is of another world.
Another dimension.</p>
<p><strong>rocky</strong>: That’s twenty seconds!!</p>

<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It’s some kind of mirror!</p>

the light back into itself!!</p>
<p><strong>rangers… and their power rangers uniforms materialize
on</strong>: THEM! Their visors are clear so we can see their faces.</p>

of the Ninjetti!</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: There goes the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>skull</strong>: A real shame.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’ve been brainwashed! This Ivan is no
Wizard. He’s some kind of DEMON!</p>
<p><strong>kid #4</strong>: Shut up, squirt.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: You can’t talk that way about our
leader.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You gotta believe me – he’s</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Listen to me! Our parents are in danger! If we
don’t help them they’re going to be killed!</p>
<p><strong>bulk</strong>: We could take it with us.</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Rangers… I’m afraid you’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>alpha 5</strong>: Zordon… he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: … This can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “To those who possess the Great Power… all
things are possible.”</p>
<p><strong>zordon</strong>: Welcome back, kids.</p>
