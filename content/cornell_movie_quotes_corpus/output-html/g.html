<h1 id="g">g</h1>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: … last few years have brought many advances
in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the
land-based maritime specialties. What’s more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses with an eye on –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. “Land-based maritime
specialties.” Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Would that be anything like “typing”?
“Restocking the cupboards”? That sort of thing, Mr. Hayes?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Hardly the case, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Well, I’m just an old dame without much
time left, so you’ll pardon me if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy’s
seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case
in point…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: “The Lark Report.”</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Madam Senator… this is an internal document
of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: The Navy’s conclusion regarding the crash
of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so
happens. You’re familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I was one member of the investigating
commission.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Yes, I see your signature right here –
twice the size of everyone else’s. And your conclusion was “pilot
error,” hmm?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: I’m really not prepared for any kind of
in-depth review of –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I’d like to think our next Secretary of the
Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: The commission concluded that the aviator in
question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: That aside for the moment, I’m struck by
the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report… the degrading remarks by other
aviators… innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations… even a
reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. In my seven years on
this committee, I’ve never seen a downed aviator treated like this.
Never. I’m deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not just what it
bodes for women in the military – but for your own confirmation as
well.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: … a full 35 percent of all jobs in the U.S.
military are still, to this day, off-limits to women. And that’s simply
gotta change.</p>
<p><strong>press #1</strong>: What about those who say women aren’t
suited for all jobs? That they’re physically weaker… they have less
stamina…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Sure. And we’re gonna hog the bathroom,
too.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: White House boys want a private
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I’ll act surprised.</p>
<p><strong>white house #1</strong>: … to reassure you that he has every
faith in the ability of Mr. Hayes to guide the Navy into the next
century. The task, as the Administration sees it, is to acknowledge
changing realities without losing traditional values.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: ‘Zat it? Ten minutes, nothin’ on the table?
Sweetcakes, you best go back to the President and tell him to open up
the phone book and start lookin’ for his next nominee.</p>
<p><strong>white house #2</strong>: Administration’s plan for 100
percent integration. If female candidates measure up in a series of test
cases, the President will support full integration within three years’
time.</p>
<p><strong>white house #2</strong>: It’s your gender-blind Navy,
Senator. Surely you’re not going to balk now.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Well, it’s just that askin’ you all to
integrate the Navy is like sending a man to do a woman’s job. How do you
propose to handle the Combat Exclusion Laws?</p>
<p><strong>white house #2</strong>: Keep narrowing the definitions. Keep
redefining.</p>
<p><strong>white house #1</strong>: We got around it in Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: By calling women “Honorary Men.”
Ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>white house #2</strong>: C’mon, Senator, President’s pitchin’
right down the center of your plate. If women measure up to men, they’ve
got the job. You going to take a swing? Or step out of the box?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>white house #2</strong>: Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: So she picks the women, we pick the programs.
Seals?</p>
<p><strong>flag officer #1</strong>: I’d go Special Reconnaissance.
Every bit as tough – and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the
men.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Then I suggest we start there.</p>
<p><strong>flag officer #1</strong>: Doesn’t matter who she picks. No
woman is going to last one week in a commando training course. And I
don’t care who it is.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Lieutenant O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Gotta situation here. Where are you? Stuck in
traffic?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha
got?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: All right, stand by, we’re going to switch
over to COMSAT…</p>
<p><strong>tactical officer</strong>: Voice-system now secure…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Okay, fresh stuff: Lost a NATO plane over the
Sea of Japan. ELB signals leads us to believe the pilot is alive and has
made his way to the North Korean shore, near a fishing village,
“Tamyung.”</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Do we know it’s him using the beacon? Not a
decoy?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Signals received only sparingly, in such a
pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to
conserve his batteries.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chances of recovery?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: You’re the analyst for East China, O’Neil.
Analyze.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: North Korean beaches are the best protected,
most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so
propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team
has to be small and silent – I’d go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem
is, don’t want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.
Where’s The Polk?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Halfway ’round the world. So that’s the
problem – we can get the team in, just not out.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Unless you Whiskey Run.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Blank faces here, O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a
getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was
jump on and take a ride. Check the files – DPRK-57 – I doped it out as a
contingency plan: Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up
with recovery sub. But don’t waste time opening and closing hatches.
They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: You expect the extraction team to ride the
sub bare-back? Is that correct, O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.
Why not?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: All right, sending the recommendation across
the river. Royce out.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No, thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: That was good headwork, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, sir. We hear back from the
Pentagon?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Probably hear back from CNN first.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Hate this part. Just sweating it out on the
sidelines.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Intel has its own glory, lieutenant – no
matter how subtle.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: By the way, I’ll need that option paper by
11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover. And do we have
any of that breakfast tea around here?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Is this my glory, sir?</p>
<p><strong>n.i.c. secretary</strong>: Excuse me, but I have Senator
DeHaven on the line for you.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Jesus God, what now?</p>
<p><strong>n.i.c. secretary</strong>: I’m sorry, sir no – she asked to
speak with Lieutenant O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: So everyone I talk to says you’re top
drawer with silk stockings inside.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, ma’am. Um, may I ask what this is
regarding?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: High-school pentathlete… ROTC scholarship,
graduated with honors… top marks in Basic Training… and, as it just so
happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia. Oh, the things I’ll
do for one extra vote.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Lieutenant O’Neil, I am prepared to
nominate you for the Navy’s Special Reconnaissance program. Should you
accept, you’ll ship out to Coronado next week and join in the big
testosterone festival. Complete the course, and you’ll have a fast
ticket to any assignment you want. That’s my personal promise to
you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: “Coronado.”</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I know that, sir. Ma’am. It’s just that…
Beggin’ your pardon, Senator, but… do you understand that this involves
combat training?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: This is just a test case, O’Neil. But if it
works out – if you work out – it could well change the Navy’s official
policy on women in combat. Or, actually, its official non-policy. Now
who’s your immediate superior there?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Captain Dwyer. Technically.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: My office will fill him in and help
expedite. Look forward to meeting you at the proper time. Jumping off
now…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Uh, question, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Would I be the only one? The only woman?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: There’ll be more to follow – but yes, dear,
right now you’re the pick of a very large litter. And your success would
mean a lot. Jumping, now…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Well, shit-a-doodle-do…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: … well, I survived Basic Training and three
brothers – so I know how to fight. What scares me are the sexual
politics. I don’t want to be turned into some poster girl for women’s
rights.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: So why’re you even considering it? Are
you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Just like you would be.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Spec-Recon. Those guys are world- class
warriors. And they will not want you there, Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I take it you don’t either. Feet.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Well, you’re doin’ shit-hot at Intel.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Royce. We’re the same age, we started the
same time – and now you’re sitting in the upperdecks while I’m still
down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: She’s haze grey and underway…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You need operational duty to really advance…
you need combat training to go operational… yet combat training is
off-limits to people with tits. I’m topped out at Intel. Forget the
glass ceiling – I’m beating my head on a big brass ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: So dump on me.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: This has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Well, guess I don’t even need to be here…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Get your dick back here. It has everything
to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: You’re such a ball-breaker sometimes.
Especially at night.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sorry. But after our days… So if I try this
thing… if I ship out to Coronado… what happens here?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I’ll try to keep the door open. If you wash
out, I make it so that –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wai’, wait. What happens if it works? Four
months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I don’t feel like doing an option paper on
the rest of my life, Jordan. Maybe we should just let it happen.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Which is guy-speak for…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my
mouth. But I’m trying to be honest, okay? Three years is a long time.
Don’t ask me to predict how I’ll feel then, Jordan, because I don’t
know. And either do you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You know, right up until you said that – I
thought I did know.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Jordan…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, Royce. It was shaping up like
such a tough call – and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really,
thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Excuse me, lieutenant. I was told this is
where I check in.</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: So you’re the one.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Still don’t have my bearings yet. Direct me
to the officer’s quarters?</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: You’ll proceed directly to the
infirmary for eye tests, blood tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.
Uniform issue adjacent. Then you’re to report to the Base Commander.
He’d like a word with you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Fine. And the officer’s quarters?</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: C.O.’s office can supply you with
directions. Enjoy your visit, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: B.O.Q., south side. Take a starboard tack
out the door.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, ensign.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: No problem, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: Lieutenant j.g. O’Neil reporting, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Yes, of course. Please, have a seat,
lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Would you care for a beverage? Tea?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: So. We’re still coming to terms with the exact
protocol for this – for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not
always be smooth, but we’re trying to make it as painless as possible
for you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain
amount of pain.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Barber was my next stop, sir. Would’ve had
it regulation sooner, only –</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Don’t worry about it. If it’s off your collar
and out of your eyes, that’s all I’m going to ask.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Really, I have no problem with –</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I’m not out to change your sex, lieutenant.
You’ll have separate beds, separate heads. If you have specific medical
needs, inform the infirmary. If a classmate or superior acts in an
harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately
so I can deal with it immediately. Questions?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: None at this time, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Then that’s all I have to say. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, I just want you to know… I’m not here
to make a statement. I don’t want to make men look foolish. All I care
about is completing the training and getting operational experience –
just like everyone else, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I
suspect we wouldn’t be making statements about not making statements,
would we? Take your leave.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: What am I scannin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Special Reconnaissance. Here you will be
trained to infiltrate hostile territory… to be the real- time eyes on
the ground… to recover assigned targets and, if need be, to fight your
way out under adverse conditions.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik, cortez, flea, stamm, england, newberry,
wickwire.</strong>: We’ll get to know them later. Dressed in Navy
greens, they stand in formation – ten rows, ten deep, helmets in hand.
Pacing before them:</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: That is all that will be said about the
special nature of this class – by us or by you. Many of you have waited
years for admission to this program. Opportunities like this are rare –
and those who seize upon them are rarer still.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Other than that, there is little to be said
but “Good luck, gentleman.” “Gentlepersons.”</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Now I turn you over to the chief training
officer. He has earned six naval commendations, the purple heart, and
the Navy Cross for heroism and valor. I give you Master Chief John James
Urgayle.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: The sun and moon… the ebb and flow of the
Pacific tides… global warming… the very angle of the Earth upon its
axis… these are just some of the things I control in my world.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Darth Vader reads poetry…</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: We are so fucked.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Count down… one, two… count down… three,
four…</p>
<p><strong>class cadence</strong>: One, two, three, four… One, two,
three, four…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You may think that you are the brightest,
the best, the strongest. I assure you, that is a total delusion on your
part. It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be.
60 percent of you will not finish this course. How do I know? Because
that is an historical fact.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Poles down.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Now for the bad new: I always like to get
one quitter on the first day. And until I do, the first day does not
end. So look around right now – go on, do it. I wonder who it’s gonna
be…</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Down to BVDs!</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Now face the Pacific… link arms…
and take a stroll!</p>
<p><strong>stamm</strong>: What is it with the damn phone poles? We sign
up for Spec-Recon or GTE?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Just trying to thin the herd. That’s all
they want to do right now.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Man. Doesn’t she know it’s rude to
point?</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: Wow. You see that girl?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: I got eyes, Newberry.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: One night. Just one night in my room, she’d
forget all about playin’ commando.</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Tone that shit down, Slutnik. You heard
with they said.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Out of the water!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Now make like sugar cookies and roll in
the sand for me.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Collect those poles, gentlemen. Still a
lotta beachfront you haven’t seen…</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: How bad? Stamm?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We better get a medic over –</p>
<p><strong>stamm</strong>: No, goddamnit. No.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Up! Up! Up! Up!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Pain is your friend. You ally. It will
keep you awake in times of emergency… it will tell you when you are
seriously injured… it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the
job and get the hell home. But you know the best thing about pain?</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: It lets you know that you aren’t dead
yet.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Go regulation if you can’t do the
reverses, O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thank you, sir. But I like these just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Not doin’ them very fine,
O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’ll try anyway, sir.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: You’ll try what we tell you to try,
O’Neil. Go regulation.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Who’s it gonna be. I just wonder, who is
it gonna be…</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: On your belly… on your back… on
your feet… on your belly… on your back… on your feet…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You have noticed a ship’s bell hanging at
the west side of this courtyard. If, at any time, you feel you cannot
continue with your training – that bell is your salvation. Strike it
three times, and the ordeal is over.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Yes, it is a long walk. So I’ll make it
as easy as I can.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Now you don’t have to watch me watching
you break rank. Because I know someone here wants to do it.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Now I know what you’re thinking…</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: I’m thinkin’ we could jump him right
now…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: “Can I really take 15 weeks of this
bubonic asshole?” If you don’t know the answer to that question, the
answer is “No, you cannot.” And that is another historical fact. So do
it. Admit you don’t have what it takes… admit you are out of your depth
– or we’re all heading back to the beach right now. Instructors! Time
hack!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Six… five… four… three… two… one… HACK!
The time is now 12-hundred. The sun is shining brightly. Plenty of
daylight left for another phone-pole run…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Leave your helmet there, Stamm. Back to
the barracks.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: The rest of you should remember one
thing. The only easy day was today. Lieutenant Wickwire? Turning it over
to you.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Cuh-lass, face right!</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Better look elsewhere, O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Half a night, Lord, just gimme half a night
to set her straight…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Average woman is 25 percent body fat. That’s
one-quarter fat, man. Think about that.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Nice distribution, though.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: No way does she makes this program. No
way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s not so much that they hate you…</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: They’re more afraid of you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Well, now I feel so much better.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: It was made clear before you came –
harassment equals career suicide. Can’t say anything good, so they don’t
say much at all. To your face, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Whose orders were those?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy.
First week’s hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.
That’s hell-and-a-half.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: And how do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Made it to Week 10 last time.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I didn’t know they let you try again.
Especially at your age.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: You’re kind of a surprise yourself.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: England, 88 seconds. You’re good to go
for the slide-for-life. Wickwire, roll back till you get south of
90.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Fuck. Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Who’d you kiss to get back in here,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: Hang on, here…</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Aw, what is this…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: Don’t have to use it, O’Neil, but
it’s gotta go out. Five… four… three…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I can make this wall without –</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: … two… one… MARK!</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Shit of a saint…</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Take her, take her here, Cortez… lookit that
monkey-man go… hoo- yah, hoo-yah…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Cortez, 93 seconds. O’Neil, 94. Cortez,
do a little rescue-recovery on your gonads and line up again. O’Neil…
move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Say again, sir?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You heard me. Move on.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Aw, this is such bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chief, sir, I don’t understand why –</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Educate her, Pyro.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Automatic five-second deduction,
which slips you under the wire. It’s called “gender-norming,” O’Neil –
standard procedure for all females in physical training courses. Where
you been the last few years?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What “all females”? If I’m the only –</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Twice now, I have said the words “move
on.”</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Can’t live with them, can’t kill them.
What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Somebody throw a tent over this circus.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Just let it go. If it’s in your favor,
just shut the hell up and take it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to
come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Didn’t take long.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: All right, lieutenant, give me a name and
specifics, I’ll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.
A name?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It’s you, sir. And it started the day I came
here.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Oh, really.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It’s this double-standard, the separate
quarters, the deferential treatment. It’s how you pulled out my chair
and nearly served high tea the first time we met.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Because I was civil, now you’re
complaining.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I can’t afford civility, sir. How am I
supposed to fit in with these guys when you’ve got me set up as an
outsider? Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because
there’ll always be a flag in my file – “Yeah, she made it, but…” I mean,
really – why didn’t you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around
the base?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Did you just have a brain-fart?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Did you just barge in here and curse at your
base commander? If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I
resent it when people fart inside my home.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I think you’ve resented me from the start,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician
using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. What I
resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men… the
day-care center I have to build where an officer’s lounge used to be…
and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of
your personal pap smears. But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your
perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine
three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out
this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your
goddamn fragile sensibilities. DOES IT?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: No, sir, WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: The shape doesn’t bother me. It’s just that
goddamn rotten stench.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Well. ’Least now we’re talking the same
language. So one standard. Is that what you’re after?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Same rules for everyone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Straight up?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Across the board, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: And if you just happen to wash out, I won’t
have to contend with you bitchin’ to some hairy-chested female Senator?
And please note I did not identify any one in particular.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wouldn’t dream of it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Then good night.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So I’ll get a fair shot?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: You’ll get everything you want, O’Neil. Let’s
see if you want what you’re gonna get.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: This some kind of joke?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Well, who the shit you think you are?
Comin’ in here like that?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Your new roommate.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Anybody usin’ these drawers here?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can’t
stay in here. You can’t sleep right next to me.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Funny, the C.O. says I can.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Aw, lookit this, lookit this – she’s
bringin’ Tampax in here. C’mon, you got nothin’ but rooms over
there.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That your desk? I’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Listen, Sex Ape. I’m here to stay. And if
you don’t want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options –
move out or ring out. End of file.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What about you, McCool? Any problem with the
room assignment?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: “It’s not a job – it’s an adventure.”</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: 58 degrees this morning! That’s not
a bad water temp, really – if you’re standing where we are!</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: Slurred speech, lack of proper
motor control, short-term amnesia – all early signs of hypothermia!
Advanced hypothermia is easy to detect in a classmate! He’ll look like
he’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Body heat. In situations of extreme cold,
you can always count on body heat to keep you alive – and I do not mean
your own. We will break you of the cultural barriers that dictate you
should not invade another man’s space. Are any of you in a situation of
extreme cold right now?</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Then why aren’t you all over the man next
to you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Just do it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: If you can’t feel the other guy’s
pecker, you ain’t in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Come on, Montgomery…</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: Flea! O’Neil! Why is there a break
in that line?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Montgomery, why do they call you “Flea”?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: It’s really “F. Lee Montgomery” – but that
gets whittled down to just “Flea.” For short, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So it really has nothing to do with actual
brain size?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: No, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you
just showed me. But I don’t need it and don’t want it – not that kind of
respect, anyway. It’s just gonna hurt us both, okay?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: I’ll work on it, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Do that.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Check your watch, Pyro. Seems fast.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Hey. You okay, Flea?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: ’Snot me. It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Jesus, my hands… they aren’t workin’
right…</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: How long i’zis for?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: ’Sposed to be 20-minute intervals, no
more.</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: Swear each time’s gettin’ longer.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: This where you bailed last time, Wick?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Huh-uh – but wasn’t middla February last
time, either.</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: How you doin’, Miller? Miller?</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: 22 minutes…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Remember, all this is completely
voluntary. For any of you who don’t want to continue, Instructor Johns
is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Any takers?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: He’s the fuckin’ Antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Wick! They really got donuts over there? Or
just some’a last night’s dinner rolls?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Look like donuts to me…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What’re you guys doing? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Just askin’</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What, you gonna give it all up for a maple
twist? How dumb you gotta be? That’s exactly what they –</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>medics</strong>: Tell me what day this is… look at me now…
what city are you from, sailor… here, look right here…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You want another minute to think about
this? Huh? Do any of you want to reconsider?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Johnson. Get ’em out of my scan.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: By my watch… which, of course
appears to be broken… they’ve been in 27 minutes without the benefit of
protective gear.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Everybody out.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Hey. Way to gut it out.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thanks, Wick.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Miller. Thought the guy was made of
depleted uranium. Really didn’t expect to lose him.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This
one’ll be no different.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Change those clothes, be back here
in six minutes! And I am timing you!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Jesus Christ. And I only got three minutes
apiece…</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Barkin’ up the wrong dress, Slutnik. You
ain’t their type.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: O’Neil! What’re you gawking at?</p>
<p><strong>p.r. flak</strong>: “… last week at Coronado. The woman,
identity unknown, is believed to be the first female candidate for the
elite Special Reconnaissance program. Her presence could signal a shift
in the Navy’s long-standing policy that excludes women from combat
positions.”</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I’m asking again. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: Inbound now, sir. Had to pull her out of the
dive bell.</p>
<p><strong>p.r. flak</strong>: I have interview requests from two local
TV stations. And a sociologist from U.C. San Diego called, wanted to
know if she could examine the interaction between “G.I. Jane” and the
men.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: “A sociol…” Kill the interviews. I don’t need
civilians nosin’ around in matters that are supposed to be covert in
nature. Just kill ’em before this whole thing gets outta con –</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: Senator DeHaven calling, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Base Commander Turrentine speaking.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Commander, are you of the habit of letting
photographers traipse around your base snappin’ their fill? These were
supposed to have been discreet test cases –</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Senator, they stand out on the public highway
with telephoto lenses –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: – and now I got reporters from Toadsquat,
Iowa, calling my office and askin’ what I know about this “G.I. Jane”
thing.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: – nothing I can do about it unless you’re
suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties – which I’d happily do if
you’ll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Are you truly mouthin’ off to a senior
member of the Senate Arms Committee? I mean, I’ll give you points for
style – just nothin’ for smarts.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: See me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: You makin’ friends with the press,
lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Well, seein’s how this thing is out, you
let me handle the r.p.m. From this point forward, I want all press
matters coordinated via my office. I’ll be god-damned if I’m gonna watch
Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or
the President. This my shade? “Midnight Mahogany”? ‘Cuz I’m comin’
dangerously close to lookin’ like Ronald Reagan here.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Your prerogative, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Awright. How’s our girl doin’, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Standing right here in my office.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Jordan, dear. How are they treating
you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Can’t complain, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Hmmm. Maybe I’ll ask when I see you in
person.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Uh, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Gonna be visiting that all-woman’s
America’s cup team in a few weeks – If I were a gambler, I’d say Dennis
O’Conner’s days are numbered. But they’re in San Diego, so I thought I’d
take a quick promenade of the base.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally
take some time, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: “Security”? What the hell you talkin’
about? Your base isn’t secure?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Of course, but there’s more –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Then set out the good plates, we’ll all
have lunch. My office will follow up with details. Jumping off, now…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing
to do with any of this. Not this article, not –</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: “We’ll all have lunch.” Good idea. Oh, and
let’s be sure to invite this sociologist, too – just in case we want to
have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: Sir? Secretary Hayes calling.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Permission to leave, sir?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Permission to evaporate, O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Think I overplayed it?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Congress and the Pentagon share a
lot of plumbing. They’ll never know whose leak it is.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Boat Five – Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl,
Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.
Follow his orders to your death.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Get it up!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Boat Six – England, O’Neil, McCool,
Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik. Lieutenant England is your senior
officer.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Ah, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Motherachrist…</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Me? Again?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Somebody got a problem with the
muster?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Fine by me, sir!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: No problem, sir!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Full of joy here, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Boat Seven…</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: First crew to finish gets hot food
and warm racks for the night! Rest of you are digging hide-sites and
eating earthworms tonight!</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: So shutup and stroke, McCool!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Your boat just hit razor coral. What do
you do now?</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Patch and pump! C’mon! Whose ass is on the
kit?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: I say keep paddlin’! We’re almost –</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Forget it, McCool! Pri One is to save the
boat, not win a race! So let’s get on it!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Four years I petition to get into this
program. Four years. Finally get here, and now it’s co-ed? Such
bullshit. Now I’m gettin’ hammered just ’cuz she’s on our crew.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Least you don’t have to sleep with her
every goddamn night.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Tellin’ you, I’d rather be the last class
with balls than the first one with chicks.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a Navy man.
Wanted to fire them big guns on a big-ass battleship. But Navy said to
him, “Oh, no. You can only do one thing on a battleship.” “Well what’s
that?” grandaddy said. “Cook,” they said. Now this ain’t 100 years ago –
I’m talkin’ United States Navy, middla World War II. And you know the
reason they gave him? You know why they tol’ my grandaddy he couldn’t
fight for his country?</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: He talked too much?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: “Negroes can’t see at night. Bad night
vision.”</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You’re kiddin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: See, you just the new nigger on the block,
O’Neil. That’s all. And maybe you moved in too early.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: What in God’s name…</p>
<p><strong>cnn commentator</strong>: … is denying that it is considering
changing its long-held policy of exclusion – but it isn’t denying the
presence of at least one female in a heretofore all-male program. Dubbed
“G.I. Jane” by the media, this woman is now undergoing commando training
at the Special Warfare Command Center in San Diego…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Goddamn. My poster girl.</p>
<p><strong>cnn commentator</strong>: Senator DeHaven’s office still has
not released the identity of the woman, but DeHaven is confirming that
“G.I. Jane” has outlasted many of her male counter-parts in the program,
said to be one of the most grueling anywhere. Joining us now on
“Washington Tonight” for the feminist perspective is Gloria Allred, live
from –</p>
<p><strong>compliments</strong>: Congratulations, Mr. Secretary. Say
hello to the President for me… Maybe now you can change that carpet in
your office, Teddy… So what was the deal you made with DeHaven? Or was
it the Devil? Always get them confused…</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Didn’t you hear? Effective immediately, all
navy vessels can no longer be referred to as “she.”</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: … women are child-bearers. Life- givers.
Now we’re going to make them killers?</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: … just don’t have the upper-body
strength…</p>
<p><strong>voice #3</strong>: How strong do you need to be to launch a
rocket? To push a button or pull a trigger?</p>
<p><strong>dial-a-date</strong>: Are we going to dance?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>e-ringer</strong>: Commander Royce. How’s life across the
river?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Little slow, sir. When’s the Pentagon going
to send me a good crisis?</p>
<p><strong>e-ringer</strong>: I’ll check my out-basket in the morning.
Say, do you know…</p>
<p><strong>circle #1</strong>: … but men have trained as athletes for
5,000 years. Women have been at it for, what, couple of decades? Do we
really know the limits of their strength?</p>
<p><strong>circle #2</strong>: Or their endurance? You know, 30 years
ago, women marathoners were 90 minutes off the pace of the men. Now, the
women’s time is probably only 20 minutes off.</p>
<p><strong>circle #1</strong>: Try 15.</p>
<p><strong>circle #3</strong>: But what do female soldiers really
contribute? I mean, why is this “G.I. Jane” there instead of a man?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: You wait right here. I’ll get the drinks.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Take my word for it. It’s just not going
to happen. Not now, not anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: You’re guaranteeing that?</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: I have it on unorthodox but reliable
authority that combat positions will remain off-limits. Despite what’s
happening with our Babe in Boyland.</p>
<p><strong>naval officer</strong>: Well, isn’t that what these test
cases are supposed to decide? Unless, of course, you’re suggesting that
“G.I. Jane” is on her way to becoming “Jane Doe”…</p>
<p><strong>bald spot</strong>: All I’m saying is that we won’t be
integrating – despite the rhetoric coming off Capitol Hill, despite
what’s happening in Coronado. And you did not hear it from me.</p>
<p><strong>naval officer</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>dial-a-date</strong>: There you are. Can we please dance
now?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>j.o.</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Take a dance!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Crew Six! Stand by!</p>
<p><strong>england</strong>: Flea! ’Cool! O’Neil! Cortez! Slutnik! In
that order! Five- second intervals! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Hoo-yah! Better’n sex in a car crash!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Next recovery! Keep goin’, keep
goin’!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You know, the Israelis…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: … they tried women in the 1967 War.
Female soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Permission to get dressed, sir?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: It seems the men couldn’t get used to the
sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.
Israeli men would linger over wounded females – often to the detriment
of the mission, often endangering their own lives. They don’t use women
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy
Cross. May I ask what you got it for?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: For pulling a 210-pound man out of a
burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I see. So when a man tries to rescue another
man, he’s a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he’s gone
soft.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Could you have pulled that 210-pound man
clear, lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Females in combat situations impact unit
cohesion. Men fight better without women around. And that is an
historical fact.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It also seems like a problem with the men’s
attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room
instead.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: England went out with a stress fracture.
That puts you in charge, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: McCool’s that same rank. We’re both
j.g.’s.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You were commissioned one month earlier,
which makes you the senior officer. Remember. There are no bad crews –
only bad leaders.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: No operational experience, and now she’s
callin’ the shots? Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Suppose she’ll wanna eat with us now…</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: O’Neil… O’Neil… O’NEIL!</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: One burst, one body, O’Neil! What
the fuck you trying to do? Spell your name? You are not infantry! Your
firepower is limited! Excessive killing only risks compromise…</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: S.E.R.E. training coming up.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: They take you away to San Clemente Island.
Half the guys quit when they come back. Supposed to be just
hell-and-a-half.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That’s what I hear.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Can I ask you somethin’, lieutenant? How
come you’re doing this? I mean, we’re kinda curious.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Who’s “we”?</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Just some of the women.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I don’t know if there’s any single reason.
But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in
his den. It showed a girl trying on a sailor’s uniform while saying,
“Gee, I wish I were a man! I’d join the Navy!” Was maybe 10 years old
when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong. Made me mad. And I
don’t think a month has gone by that I haven’t thought about that
poster. “Gee, I wish I were a man.”</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: I’ve been accused of that wish.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: The woman I saw you with…</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Just a friend. We have friends, too, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: But are there… I mean, how many…</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: More than you’d guess. It’s just that we
don’t hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any
one time, the guys think it’s some kind of uprising.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Sounds funny now, but it’s really not. We
have to be careful. The Navy still knows how to put on a witch-hunt.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Royce…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I’ve been trying you for five days. Don’t
they give you messages?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It’s hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much
less keep up with my phone life.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: How hard they making it on you?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I feel like there’s men here, there’s women
here – then there’s men. But hey, what’d I expect?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Well, not this. I was doing the Pentagon
scene few nights ago. Got some fresh stuff – about you. You may be in a
hostile camp. I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you
crash and burn.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Me? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Don’t you know? How they’re talking about
you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I saw an article…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I can’t walk two blocks in Washington without
hearing about “G.I. Jane.” You’re all over the place, and whether you
wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think
someone’s gunning for you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me
without you turning up the jets, too.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I’m only trying to warn you in case –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Well, let me warm you: I’m going though with
this. The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it
just makes me want to finish. So don’t expect me back crying in your
arms any time soon, okay?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: That’s not what I want, Jordan. I mean… it is
and it isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Still can’t make up your mind, huh? Gotta
go, Royce.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Jordan. You watch your ass.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sure. I’ll join the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Infiltrate… establish your hide-
site… record any movement of troops, vehicles, patrols – any activity
inside your scan. If you are compromised, you have two options!
Newberry!</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: Evasive maneuvers or radio for emergency
extraction, sir!</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: If you are extracting, be damn sure
to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training! A helo
cannot extract you from a wooded area! You must bring it down in a
clearing! What’s the minimum clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk,
McCool?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: 32 feet, six inches, sir!</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: You will be penalized for early
extraction, but you will be penalized more for capture – trust me, far
more! Survival! Evasion! Rescue! Evacuation! Welcome to S.E.R.E.!</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Lieutenant! Don’t back down!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Feel right at home, McCool?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: South-southeast. And I don’t want to hear
another word till we’re underground.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Got two FAVs moving south. I make… four
banditos aboard, carrying… H-60 machine guns…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Newberry, get a photo. South?</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Entering my scan now…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: West?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: North?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: FAVs clear.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: You mind? I’m trying to eat here.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Don’t wanna evacuate ’cuz someone came down
with uric poisoning, el- tee.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Didn’t even bitch about the seat, did I?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: What the… Got an unknown here. 100 yards
north-northeast.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: She part of the training?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: “She?” There’s another one?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Shit. Think we’re had.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Smoke her.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: I ain’t gonna shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Only blanks. Lemme do it.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Hey. Ain’t your call, man.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Pri One is to protect the mission. If she
represents a real threat, we have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: But did she see us? Do you know for a fact
that we are compromised?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: If not, firing will only give away our
position to hostiles in the area. Now how smart is that?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Mighta been civilian.</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: They got regular peeps on this island,
don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Banditos on the east perimeter! 150 yards!
Shit, she was part of it!</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: What’s the word, el-tee? We’re about one
minute from a major take- down here.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop
everything but weapons and the PRC radio – we’re gonna be high speed,
low drag all the way to the link-up site. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Sure. Now she wants to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: MOVE!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: This ain’t workin’ right!</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: What’s our go-to-shit plan, O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: This ain’t even workin’ wrong!</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Really don’t wanna be captured, el- tee. Heard
some bad things.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Fuck. Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six
requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix…</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: 32 feet, six inches!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m lookin’, I’m lookin’!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: ’Cool?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Smoke it!</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Where are you… HEY! Where are you taking
her?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: How long? Please, HOW LONG?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: “Don’t know how much I can take”… “A little
taste of death”… “Save the nail”… “It’s been three days now”…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: You know, I had an apartment about this
size once.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wick. They got your crew, too?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They
found his tracks. Well, shit.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You really came back for more? Of this?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: When I was sittin’ behind a desk in
Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother. He was
Spec-Recon. And the stories he used to tell…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: If you got a good one, Wick…</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: One time he was doing a rekkie of the
Libyan coastline. This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into
the past tense. So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big
artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.
But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: They had to kill ’em?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on
every guard’s chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette. Just a little
calling card to say they’d been there – and could come back any time
they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That’s a good story.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: So the shit you gotta go through? To get
from here to there? Brother said it was worth it. Worth the training…
worth the divorce… worth anything.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: He was married?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: At first.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You got anybody, Wick?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Not me. You?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: How’d you make it last time, Wick? How’d you
get through this part?</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Last time I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Let’s keep talkin’, Wick. Just keep talkin’
to me…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Suitable for framing…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Got time for a brain-pick?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Subject?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: O’Neil, Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Thought you two were file-closed.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: You knew about us?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Computer – no transcription, no com-link, no
data-link. In fact… shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8, mark.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: All right. So who stands to gain if
Jordan flames out in a big way?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: The E-Ringers? Full integration is gonna cost
the services billions at the worst possible time – when Congress is
already swinging the axe.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Congress cuts, military bleeds. But
Pentagon’s a big place. Let’s narrow the sights.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: The Navy? They’ve made it clear they don’t
want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women’s heads. What’s
it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident’s co-ed?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn’t be a
first. But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public
failure?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Hmm. Let’s aim higher.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: The White House. If Jordan wins, DeHaven
wins in spades. Why? Well, it’s been said that the only man the
President fears – ain’t no man.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: The first female President?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Don’t for a second think she didn’t leak
this story. “G.I. Jane” gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the
biggest constituency of them all.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Women.</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: If you were the President, wouldn’t that
put a little piss in your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I don’t know. Seems…</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: This ain’t about some little soldier girl
sloggin’ her way through commando school. The implications go way
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Christ, I don’t want to see her take a fall.
She thinks I do, but…</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: I take it this file is still open.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Even tough I don’t talk to her every day – I
still talk to her every day. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: Okay, so now work it from the other end.
Think about California – and how things might be handled there.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I don’t… What, someone on base? A “mole”?</p>
<p><strong>the spook</strong>: This is what you get for brain- picking
an old CIA spook. but if I needed to control the outcome of this test
case, that’s how I’d do it. A man-in-place. Makes everything very
controllable.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: What is your father’s name?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Simple question, lieutenant. No reason
not to answer. What is your father’s name?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: “Dad.”</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Any brothers? Sisters?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Dick, Jane, and Spot.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Are you hungry? What’s your favorite
food? We’ll try to get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Green Eggs and Ham. You’re not going to get
anywhere. You might as well put me in the cage.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You are in the cage, O’Neil. Right here,
right now.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Should I be afraid?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Right down to your worthless womb, and
I’ll tell you why. This is my island. My world. And here I can get away
with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take
another scan of my little joy- boy outside. If I can do that to a Navy
Seal, what’s gonna happen to you? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Why didn’t you shoot the woman,
O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wasn’t deemed a threat.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: She led us right to you. That’s no
threat?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Would you have shot if it was a man?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No. Yes. I mean, depends on –</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: The others already told me, O’Neil. They
wanted to shoot, but you wouldn’t let them. Because you went soft on
another women –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: That’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: That’s what your crew said. Are they
lying? Or are you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I think you’re the liar.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I’m not the one who got five good men
thrown in a bamboo cage. You wear the bars, you made the call, and you
got your whole crew –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We didn’t know we were compromised. Firing
would only’ve given away our position.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You think we should go easy on women,
O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I’m so glad we agree.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Didn’t you know you’d be raped if you
were captured? Didn’t you even think about that?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sure. Just like your men do.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I think we oughtta practice it, just so
you know what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Should I practice bleeding, too, sir? Would
that make me a better soldier?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Any of you can stop this! Just give me
the location of one more hide- site, and it ends right here!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Someone’s trippin’ out here…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Three crews are still on this island
somewhere. Who knows where?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Don’t do it, don’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Who’s gonna tell me? Who’s gonna be
chivalrous and stop this abuse? What, you want to see her get mauled? Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Don’t tell him shi –</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: She’s fine! When I put you down, O’Neil,
take the hint and stay down.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I am saving your life, O’Neil. You may
not know it, but I do. You’re an inferior soldier, a bad officer, and I
don’t want you learning that inconvenient truth when you’re stuck in a
muddy bomb crater behind enemy lines and don’t know how the fuck to get
out. You get out now, O’Neil. Seek life elsewhere. And if you can’t do
it in front of me, do it behind my back.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Down… stay down…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Fuck you and the boat you rode in on.
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: We’re done here.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Make you a deal, Flea. Never tell me how I
look – and I’ll never tell you.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: You don’t think she’d be raped if she
were captured? You don’t think the threat of rape would be used to
leverage the men?</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: You broke a dozen training rules
back there – before I lost count.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I’ve had it. Just because they pay me
like a baby-sitter doesn’t mean I’m gonna be one.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: She’s a trainee, just like the
others. Why are you coming down so hard?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: She’s an officer. There’s a higher
standard.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: She’s a women, and that’s why
you’re ridin’ her bareback.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Of course it is. And I’m gonna stay on
her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights
thing, that real lives are gonna be lost. Maybe mine, maybe yours.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: I oughtta report you.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: I think you probably would – if you
didn’t know I was right.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got
a call this morning from –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Not that. The White House just
announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke,
void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: You there? Senator?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Without telling us they do this? With
absolutely no lead time?</p>
<p><strong>flag officer #1</strong>: Mr. Secretary, if this bill
passes…</p>
<p><strong>flag officer #2</strong>: Forget our three-year plan. They’re
rushing the cadence. We’ll be forced to reorganize the Navy from top to
bottom – overnight.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: What the hell is the President trying to do?
Steal DeHaven’s thunder?</p>
<p><strong>flag officer #1</strong>: I think it’s more important, sir,
to decide what we’re going to do – since it’s apparent this issue is not
going away quietly.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: “G.I. Jane.” And which one of you told me she
wouldn’t last a week? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: 20 years in the Pentagon, I finally rate an
office with a window – and it looks out over the world’s largest
graveyard. Think it’s a sign?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sorry, didn’t mean to –</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: That’s okay. Just an ex-girlfriend. And
know I remember why.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: First big night of liberty and no date?
You’re pathetic, Wickwire.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Maybe I’ll just head over to McP’s with
the others, have a drink or four. Don’t wanna come, do you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I can’t go out. Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: I think you look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Thanks for lying. But you’re the class
officer, Wick, and it’d just be weird if we hook up. Besides…</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Sorry. Forgot I needed oregano and…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Do you, uh, know…</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Sure, sure.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We’re going over to her place to make salad
and pasta. Just, you know, nothing special.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: Okay. Well… thought I’d ask.</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: … underwater detonation devices
employ mechanical timers, and as such, they are subject to variances due
to water temperature. That’s why when clearing mines, we always use two
timers. The charts now being passed out contain calculations you must
memorize before…</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>instructor johns</strong>: You’re wanted at the C.O.’s.</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: This way, lieutenant. They’re expecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: See me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I don’t know of any delicate way to say this,
lieutenant, so I won’t try. Claims have been made that you have engaged
in fraternization – of the same-sex variety. Specifically, that you
were… “… seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a
time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming.”</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, if someone is suggesting that I’m a
lesbian, they’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: They’re very wrong. And I’d like to know
where you got this information.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: I’m sorry, O’Neil. But as class officer,
it’s my obligation to report all violations.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: This is insane. You’ve got no proof.</p>
<p><strong>x.o.</strong>: You were seen leaving Ensign Blondell’s
apartment at approximately 0-200, whereupon physical affections were
exchanged in public.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We hugged.</p>
<p><strong>x.o.</strong>: In addition, you have been seen frequenting
the base exchange, the mess hall, the –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Because the men didn’t want me eating with
them. Jesus Christ, let’s get this right.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: That’s enough. Everybody. Rejoin your class,
lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>wickwire</strong>: I wish I didn’t have to do this,
Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Dismissed, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, I just want you to know that this is
either a gross mistake – or someone’s vindictive bullshit. In no way did
anything happen between Ensign Blondell and myself. We’re just
friends.</p>
<p><strong>x.o.</strong>: So you’re saying the charges have no validity
whatsoever?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m saying, we’re just friends.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.
But if it’s on my desk, it’s on my shoulders. There’s going to be an
inquiry – it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty. You
should prepare yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, please… if there’s any way to do this
without dragging everyone through the mud…</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I don’t see how, O’Neil. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir. If tomorrow… I was not under your
command… would the inquiry still go forward?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I’m not sure what –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Would you have the discretion to end it
right then and there?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: So what’d he want? O’Neil?</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Oh, no… no, no, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Stand fast!</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I want to kill them… I want to kill the guys
who made you cry like this…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I
couldn’t get it, I couldn’t stay.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: And this class officer… “Wickwire.” You think
he was just trying to get even? Striking back for…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Maybe. Though it didn’t seem like he was
getting any satisfaction out of it. Almost like… Did I say he was class
officer?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Almost like someone put him up to it. Okay,
who?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No shortage of suspects.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: The Chief? Or maybe even Turrentine? Your
C.O.?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Royce. Tell me you didn’t keep a file on
me.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Somebody was yankin’ your stings, Jordan –
maybe from 3,000 miles away. I wanted to know who. I still do.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: C’mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It’s done with, Royce. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Someone screwed you over like this, left
unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you’re not gonna fight
back?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m tired of fighting back. I just wanted to
come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just
forget the rest of the world, okay?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan,
give me five minutes of good headwork.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: “John James Urgayle.” The Chief.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What about him.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Instructors typically pull three year
assignments. This guy’s in and out in one year – your year. That sound
right?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sounds like an amazing coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem
child for the Navy.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Well, pardon me if I do. Now who else? Who
could’ve leveraged a class officer like that? C’mon, Jordan, keep your
head in the game.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: … just got word today. The Senator
wants you to know that she’s disturbed by the matter, and she’ll be
looking into it carefully to make sure you were treated fairly. If you
need to reach us, we’re here in Washington, 202-224-3121.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: “In Washington…”</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wickwire said he was dry-docked in
Washington between stints at Coronado…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: “Wickwire, Thomas Dane”… Second run at
Coronado… and correct, they had him stashed in the “Appropriation
Liaison Office,” whatever that is.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You don’t crap out of Spec-Recon and get
another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country. He’s
got a Sea Daddy somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I’d sure like to know who.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Yeah. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Administration, Ensign Blondell.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Don’t say my name.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Who’s… Lieuten –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull
a transfer order?</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Okay, but… You didn’t have to do what you
did. Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: “Wickwire, Thomas Dane.” See what you can
find.</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Who signed as his “sponsoring officer”?</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Uh… don’t see it. There’s no signature.
But hang on – there’s a note to “See Addendum.” Checking…</p>
<p><strong>blondell</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What’d you find, Kathy?</p>
<p><strong>d.c. cop</strong>: Don’t even dream about leaving that
vehicle there.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Government car – tow it if you want. Just
point us to DeHaven’s office first.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Capt’n.</p>
<p><strong>navy captain</strong>: Commander.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Get started here. I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Your name again?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Lieutenant j.g. O’Neil.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Ms. O’Neil. Yes, of course. I’m
Douglas Champeau. Unfortunately, the Senator is in chamber right now.
How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What chamber? Which way is that?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: I mean, she’s on the floor of the
Senate.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Okay, which way?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: She really can’t be disturbed. But
if you care to wait, I’ll find you an office with a phone. It might be
several hours, but –</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: ’Scuse me, but I’m here to pick up gallery
tickets? Are you…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: See the secretary, please.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Senator DeHaven…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: DeHaven…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: We can talk here or we can talk outside,
Senator. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Cloak room. I’ll meet her there. Just
her.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Jordan. I always hoped we’d get together –
though just now I’m gearing up for a child-care vote that –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You know him.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon
just three days after you nominated me.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Jordan. Might we do this over lunch
tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to
see me fail?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Wickwire was there to help. To be my eyes
on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. At least that
was the intent.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What changed?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Should probably ask him that.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: If I have to ask again, Senator, I’ll be
asking in front of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>doorkeeper</strong>: Madam Senator? Your esteemed colleagues
are requesting –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Two seconds, Walter. In 1981, the Supreme
Court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions. The
Court cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws as a legal foundation for
keeping women ineligible. That decision held for all these years – until
the White House, 10 days ago, moved to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
To demolish that legal foundation.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So? Isn’t the President jumping on your
bandwagon?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: What he did was light the bandwagon on
fire. Because he knows what I know – that American families are not
prepared to put their daughters in harm’s way.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop – they
all come back the same.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: What are you saying? That a women’s life is
more valuable than a man’s? That a women’s death hurts a family
more?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I’m saying it’s not going to happen. Not
when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I
choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday
for sending daughters and young mothers off to war – and, quite
possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You were never going to let women serve in
combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Jordan. I don’t expect you to fully
understand this – but sometimes there’s more to be gained from the fight
than the victory.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the
reality gets you in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: The reality is this: We send far too many
men off to war. I don’t need to compound the problem with women. Can you
honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world
jungle with –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I wanted the choice. The chance to prove
myself, my skills, my work, me. That’s how it should’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>doorkeeper</strong>: Madam Senator, once again I must –</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan,
and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always
use a hard-charger on my team.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I’ve had no direct communication with him
since this whole thing began. And that’s quite verifiable.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I’m sure it is.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: You’ll think about my offer?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You know, I wonder what the SecNav would
think about it. If I spoke with him.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning
myself – and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only
too happy to oblige. Don’t play politics with me, little darlin’. You’d
be up way past your bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>doorkeeper</strong>: Madam Senator, please…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: I’ll call you in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So I wonder what the President would
think.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Yes sir. No, I’m not saying it would be
impossible, sir, just… Yes sir. No sir. Yes sir. I can appreciate that,
sir. Good night, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Well, if you had to go over my head,
lieutenant, that’s the way to do it. Christ, nothin’ like a 0-200 call
from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin’.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir? What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Basically – he asked me if I could unring a
bell.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: One of you here understands better than anyone
what this is all about. Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming.
Someone who knows, I would hope, what he must now do.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: And unless that someone takes the honorable
way out in the next 10 seconds – I will make certain he faces action
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Just walk away and never stop.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: It seems we have an opening for class officer.
Any nominations?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: All those in favor?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Chief Urgayle, turning it back over to
you.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Well, I’m trying to figure out if you’re
stupid, unlucky, gluttonous – or some new alloy of all three.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Good to see you again, too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Okay, O’Neil. So you’ve impressed all the
others. Now try me.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Four… three… two… one… hack!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Final assignment! Each crew will be
dropped 12 miles out! Between you and the shore is a network of mines
and underwater obstacles! You will clear the obstacles, you will tag the
mines with your crew number! You have until 18-hundred to make
landfall!</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Remember! The one thing you can count on
in any mission is that anything mechanical will fail! If you get stuck
out here, do not call me, for you will no longer be in my class! Try the
Coast Guard!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: One-second intervals! Go!</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: C’mon, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: This tank’s not gonna cut it, el- tee.
Handle’s stripped.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: I just wonder how that happened.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools
without losing the rest of out gear. Try a wrench on that thing.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: What happening?!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Fucking pelicans! Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Holy… LET’S GYRATE!</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: What the shit is…</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: You don’t suppose this is just part of…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it,
mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Base, this is Crew Leader Six. We have a
downed helo 12 miles west- south west of base with three aboard. Repeat,
we have a downed helo with three aboard…</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: CUT IT! CUT IT HERE!</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Close as I can get, el-tee!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Flea, ’Cool, Cortez, Newman – take your
minis, hit the water. Go, GO!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Base, this is Crew Leader Six. What is your
E.T.A. on that rescue helo? Over.</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: Crew Leader, we have a Medevac rerouting from
Long Beach, but no other helos prepped at this time. Seafox One and Two
are launching now. Over.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Base, don’t think you copied me. We are 12
miles out. Seafox tops out at 30 knots, which makes it a no- show for 18
minutes. Over.</p>
<p><strong>base</strong>: You copied right, Crew Leader. We’re looking
for options ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Shut your hole, Slutnik.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Visibility drops dead at 40 feet. If they’re
deeper than that…</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: Nobody’s comin’ outta that crash, el-tee.
Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Base, this is Basher One. I’ve got a
small problem here. Do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Basher One, this is O’Neil. We are barely
reading you. What is your situation?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Got one other heartbeat here, looks touch
and go. I’ve got a questionable leg.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Managed to activate the ELB. If you just
radio base and let them know, they’ll fix on that. Oh, and make sure
they send a helo with a winch – door’s blocked by a reef. Over.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chief, sir – rescue team won’t be here for
15 minutes. What’s your air situation? Over.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Say again? How many micks?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: 15, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: That… may not be adequate.</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: If we could just fix on him…</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Beacon’s a no-go for us.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chief – did I see a flare box aboard? And
can you get at it? Over.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Show us where you are, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>flea</strong>: Six o’clock! Marking, marking!</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Spotted you, Chief. Pri One is to slip you
some air, so we’re coming down with a tank – just something until the
A-team shows. Over.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chief?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: O’Neil… there’s no air in your main
tanks.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: This mission wasn’t about tagging mines.
It was to see how you coped with mechanical failures. Pretty fuckin’
ironic, huh?</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: He’s circlin’ the drain, el-tee.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes
each. ’Cool? How much air in yours?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Maybe half. Not even.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down,
we’re gonna need it. Cortez, help him. Flea? You take one of the two
full minis – and just follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: What, we’re gonna pry ’em out with
paddles?</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: O’Neil. Our air’s gonna crap out as soon as
we get down there. You know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So I guess we get one shot at it.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: Why’d it have to be her…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Chief, sir… still with me?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Take him first. Once he’s clear, come back
with –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Sir, let me suggest you stop giving orders
and start doing exactly what I say, because that’s the only way we’re
all getting out of here. Now how’s your vest check out? Still good?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed him air.
Chief, sir, you and I are gonna take the express elevator outta here.
Remember to let your air out. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: O’Neil…</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Shut up, sir. I’m concentrating.</p>
<p><strong>mccool</strong>: Hoooooo-yah!</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: Go, go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>slutnik</strong>: Uh-huh! That’s right! Just like we always
practice it!</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Senator DeHaven is here for the
graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>base guard</strong>: What are all these other vehicles?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: Just a small press corps.
Routine.</p>
<p><strong>base guard</strong>: And that pickup truck at the end?</p>
<p><strong>dehaven’s aide</strong>: That? That would be the all-woman
America’s Cup team.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Special Reconnaissance Class 118, you may now
stand down.</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Lieutenant? I was asked to give you
this.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: The Navy Cross…</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: I believe he earned it for saving a
man’s life in Saudi Arabia. He wanted you to have it. He was very clear
on that point.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I was looking for him earlier, but…</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: The Chief was granted early
retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday. By 18-hundred he was gone. Out of
the Navy.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Just a coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>instructor pyro</strong>: Maybe it’s not my place to
speculate on his private thoughts. But I think the Chief knew that his
way – his world – had come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: … of course, we always prefer peace to war.
But if we’re going to war, give women a piece. Give them the choice to
defend their country. And if the President doesn’t like that idea – if
he wants to continue to deny women their equal rights – then I’ll be
happy to step out back with him any time, anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>dehaven</strong>: Jordan? Jordan, dear…</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Senator, perhaps this would be a good time for
that lunch. Will the America’s Cup team be joining us?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: So here we are again. Staring three years of
operational duty in the face.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Look. It’s not like you’d be completely out
of reach. And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at
Norfolk instead of Coronado. There are ways of dealing with these things
– I mean, if people are so inclined.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Which is guy-speak for…</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: “Yes, Jordan – I’ll wait for you no matter
how long.”</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Still using matchlocks, are ya? I can get
you a pair of flintlocks, you let me sneak out of here. Everyone else in
this sequence speaks with a French accent.</p>
<p>****: Good ones? The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the
kill.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: The best. From Spain. And perhaps a couple
of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them. Guard #1 is even
more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: On yer feet, you Scottish pig.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: James McCullen, you have been found guilty
of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord King
Louis XIII… even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Your King is a vile bag of filth who
murders his own allies. I should’ve charged him double.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: You tried to overthrow the Crown in
conspiracy with its enemies!</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: They offered me a Chancellorship, because
unlike your simpleton King, they know that is the McCullen destiny, to
run the wars, the true power, not simply to supply arms.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Do you have anything else to say before the
sentence is carried out?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far bigger and
more powerful than any of you could ever imagine. My sons will continue
to rise along after I am gone. As will their sons. And, God willing,
their sons.</p>
<p>****: It shall not end with my death. The Warden smiles back
sinisterly.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Oh, we’re not going to kill you, McCullen.
We’re going to make an example of you.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: So that no man, woman, nor child may ever
see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term
of your natural life. The mask closes around his face. The workers melt
the lock. McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE
MEDALLION.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: War used to be the exception. Now it is
the new state of play, a constant, unavoidable…</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Tragic as they are to fight, wars must be
won. But perhaps they don’t have to be as destructive as they’ve been in
the past. A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen
behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY COMMANDERS,
many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Nano-mites. Perfect little soldiers. Their
size can be programmed as well as their intended task. Originally
developed to isolate and destroy cancer cells, but at Mars Industries,
and with the help of a little NATO funding…</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: .we discovered how to program them to
eliminate most anything. For instance… metal.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched
missile at a tank. The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER
MICROSCOPIC NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring
a horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and quickly
head for a nearby jeep.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Once the target has been destroyed, the
launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead that short-
circuits the nano-mites, preventing any unwanted destruction.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the
launcher and the NANO-MITES instantly “drop dead” around the nearby
jeep.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Each warhead contains seven million
nano-mites and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank to an
entire city. But without innocent casualties. Which is why this has been
such a priority for me and my company. The room breaks into APPLAUSE.
FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a British veteran or countless battles, not
buying it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Guess you’ll be the first arms dealer up for
the Nobel Peace Prize. Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a
good sport.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I prefer the term “armament solutions
engineer” Gentlemen! I’m pleased to announce that tomorrow morning your
first order of nanotech warheads will ship from my factory in
Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The hell’s wrong with you, Stalworth, you
didn’t eat that Chicken A La King at chow did ya?</p>
<p><strong>stalworth</strong>: The mission, sir…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What about it? Another day, another run.</p>
<p><strong>stalworth</strong>: Never had anything to worry about before.
Stalworth’s shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to Duke: A YOUNG
MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.</p>
<p><strong>stalworth</strong>: Three weeks old. Be seeing him for the
first time next leave. Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His
eyes go distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re off the mission.</p>
<p><strong>stalworth</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s what you want, right? Stalworth doesn’t
argue. Duke hands him back the photo.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If your head’s with them, you’re no good to
me. Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: One thing, though: you step off this one,
you’re out of Special Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk and chair back
at the base. You’re be run of the mill. Regular.</p>
<p><strong>stalworth</strong>: I… I guess I can live with that.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Then you should. Stalworth nods, grabs his
kit, and leaves. Duke’s hard eyes watch him go, then a slight smile
creases his lips …</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy, British
Army.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I know who you are General hawk. As sharp
in a briefing room as your reputation is on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Not hardly …You gave me a broad target, I
couldn’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: It’s an honor to meet a man of your many
accomplishments. McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: What’s on your mind, General?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Your warheads. Securing them in transit. Forty
pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Those “ears” all have top security
clearance.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We both know what that’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Look, General, delivery is my
responsibility and it’s not one I take lightly. I had NATO assign an
elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air
support. I assure you, my warheads will be quite safe.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ve made a career of showing up where I’m
needed, whether ordered to or not. And if your warheads are half as
effective as you say they are.. Then my unit is needed.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: This is no time to play catch up. The NATO
team’s been drilling for weeks. They’re lit up and ready to roll.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My unit doesn’t need mission specific
training. They’re chosen because of their ability to handle any
situation.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Maybe next time, General… What did you say
your unit was called?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I didn’t. I just said they were always ready.
McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a look, she
reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: All right, listen up, the Cougars will be
front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package. Minimum
distance at all times. Choppers will cover us overhead. The Lab Workers
step up.</p>
<p><strong>lab worker #1</strong>: Captain Hauser. Duke turns to them
and start signing forms as WALLACE “RIPCORD” WEEMS takes the case while
a little short on academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence,
charm, and courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better
and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Not gonna explode, is it?</p>
<p><strong>lab worker</strong>: They’re not weaponized yet. And the kill
switches are attached to the launchers. All the same, I’d avoid potholes
if I were you. Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another
soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it
out? If you want, I could–</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: –We have our orders. Okay, people! We’re on
the clock, let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>mount up!</strong>: Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws
him a cheesy grin. The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly.
ENGINES ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We have the
package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird
Dog crap, I just wish they’d let us say, “Hey, Pete, it’s Bill, see ya
in a few.”</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Not me, I joined up for the jargon.</p>
<p><strong>voice on radio</strong>: Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose
out.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Just saying, you know, if I ran things…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Rip, if you ran the Army we’d stay up all
night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other “Bro”.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: But we’d be badasses, right Bro?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, we’d be badasses. Eyes on the road,
Rip.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you
to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: And you know how people sometimes joke that
it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t listen to ’em. you got plenty of
thoughts up there. Keep rear security tight, boys.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Well, the second I try and make myself not
have thoughts, I always have ’em. Like now, know what I’m thinking
about?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Please don’t say the Air Forces.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: The Air Forces.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I thought we were done with that
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You were done with it, not me. Look, I loev
flying… Duke “mouths” the following sentence as Ropcord says it:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’ve been flying since I was thirteen years
old. Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I don’t think your daddy’s crop duster counts
as hours logged.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Jets, man, jets. You know I always qualify
when I’m on leave.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get up in the
air, we’ll get you a trampoline back at the base.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We’ve done ten years in the Army, I just
think we should see if the grass really is greener.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This continues to be the stupidest idea you’ve
ever come up with, nd that’s saying something.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Funny. Real funny.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I don’t wanna transfer to the Air Force,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: It’s always about you, isn’t it? Give me
one good reason?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I want to be in the fight, not flying over
it.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Won’t be saying that when you call in an
air strike and I come screaming in to save your–</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: –Eyes on the road, Rip.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hey, on the training run weren’t there
herders around here? This puts Duke instantly on the alert.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Jesus Christ! Bird Down!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Back up! Back up! Back up! Mother Goose, this
is Bird Dog. We are under attack. Repeat –we are under attack!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Out! Everyone get out of the vehicles!
Now!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, except for all the blood. Duke sees blood on the back of
Rip’s head. Then they hear a LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover
by the Grizzly.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Who the hell is that? Duke grabs Ripcord
and starts dragging him out.</p>
<p><strong>case.</strong>: Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is
running like hell.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Duke?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: If I die…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re not gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I just want you to know… you never could
run worth a damn.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus, Rip.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’m just saying, it’s be nice if you could
move a little faster. And that’s when the Cougar blows, a concussive
blast. Ana turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go
ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of her glasses
which ZOOM IN on Duke.</p>
<p><strong>down in the ditch</strong>: Duke rolls over and looks at
Rip.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m gettin’ that package. Duke leaps up and
hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs up the embankment. –And comes
face to face with a Viper, who raises his pulse rifle, about to blow
Duke away. A hand clamps down over the barrel. The Viper looks at Ana
beside him. Duke also looks at her, a flash of shocking recognition
ripples across his face.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What the hell…? Her face softens
hesitantly.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Hello, Duke… Then she round house kicks him
with her boot across the face, knocks him out on his ass.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You have to admit you had that coming. Ana
struggles with something going on inside her head. Then her face
reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the first Viper’s gun
barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Good-bye, Duke. Duke can’t believe it. Ana
suddenly glances up at something behind Duke. It’s a “HOWLER” TRANSPORT
rocketing onto the scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety
degrees to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump to
his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls- ass. A
BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and lands behind a
Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he draws and buries a KATANA
BLADE into another Viper. Then he glances at the last Viper who’s lining
up on him, too far away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK
PISTOL. BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in the
space of six breathless seconds. Duke glances at the almost mystical
figure of SNAKE-EYES sheathing his sword on his back while holstering
his smoking Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass
defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse burst just
missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana, his eyes locked on the
weapons case in her hands, PULSE BURSTS crackling past his head. He
curses under his breath:</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Air Force.. .right.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Time to lay down some bass! He fires a
grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You blink, you miss it.
BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty, but the Howler is just as nimble,
fires its LEFT-SIDE THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The
CONCUSSION BLASTS whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging
awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades. The
Typhoon’s mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air. The Howler fires
MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS and rip them apart. The
Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the recovering Typhoon. Duke races after
her through a hail of pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ana! She whirls around, drawing the weapons
case over her chest and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates,
because of the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: The warheads! Heavy Duty reluctantly
doesn’t shoot, everyone watching Ana backpedal towards the waiting
Typhoon. Duke charges like a bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the
case tumbles free. Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then
Duke goes after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray
gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon, which is
raked by the bullets.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stand down! Stand the hell down!</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Lower your weapon, Sir. We’re not the
enemy.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Pointing weapons at me doesn’t make you my
friend. ABEL “BREAKER” SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Please hand over the case, sir.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I don’t know who you are, and I sure as hell
don’t know who they are, and until I find out, I’m not lowering anything
or handling anything over. CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord
shouldering a rifle.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What’s your unit?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: That’s classified. Snake-Eyes discreetly
grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his belt, but a look from Scarlett
makes him out them back.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Someone would like a word with you. Breaker
sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke, which projects a
3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK. Duke is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: State you name and rank.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: .you first.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: My team just saved your life. now’s the part
where you say “thank you”.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Those aren’t the words that come to mind just
now. We weren’t told about any support for this mission, so you better
tell your team to stand down. Ripcord eyes his sight.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot.
Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You must be… Ripcord, expert marksman, weapons
specialist, jet</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Told ya.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’m General Clayton Abernathy. You may have
heard of me, .Duke. A glint of recognition flickers across Duke’s eyes,
he nods.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO Forward
Command… Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That was my last job. I’m in a whole new
outfit now. Duke swivels his gun to Breaker’s head. Breaker
flinches.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Just need to deactivate its tracking
beacon, for security.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Hand over the weapons case son, and let us
deliver the warheads.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No way. I signed for ’em. My mission, my
package. I carry them, I deliver them. Breaker’s scanner BEEPS. He keys
a button. The BEEPING promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Wasn’t hard, was it?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Fine. But you seem to be a little short on
transportation a the moment. Team Alpha will deliver you to me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And where exactly are you, General?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Come see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hey, you’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: He’s going into shock.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What’s your name, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I thought all the Special Ops guys were
tough.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We are tough … . but also sensitive. Whoa,
that’s some mucho primo stuff you gave me. Rip is high now, his eyes
float up to Heavy Duty who stares back at him. Rip reaches out to touch
his well-cropped hair.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: .and a kung-fu grip.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: The name’s Heavy Duty. Duke has the
weapons case on his lap.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What kind of outfit is this? Not regular Army
based on the accents. I have you as an Aussie… And you’re a
Johannesburger… And you: French North Africa. Algiers?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Tunisia. Where were you born?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Are you kidding me? Duke wasn’t born, he
was Government-Issued!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: But somehow you’re all in the same unit. One
you can’t tell me the name of right?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: We’d get tossed for telling.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Duke, Duke, don’t you get it: they’re super
secret, they’re Mission Impossible. This tape’s gonna self-destruct in
five–</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: –You’re gonna go after them aren’t you? The
ones that hit my convoy.</p>
<p>****: Then whoever you are, whatever this unit is, I want in.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Not our call. Ripcord sits up, really
woozy, looks at Scarlett.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I want in too. That way we can spend some
bunker time together. A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip’s face, an inch
away. It’s Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the
message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: You two a team or something?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We’ve been together forever. But not like
that. Hi, I’m Ripcord.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Why do they call you that? Breaker laughs,
reading Ripcord’s file:</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Because his name is Wallace Weems!</p>
<p><strong>security technician #1</strong>: Alpha-One, this is Base. You
are cleared or entry.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Welcome to the new Pit! Duke and Ripcord turn
to see hawk and Cover girl walking out from behind the lights.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Duke.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: General.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ve read a lot about you two.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Okay, look, I didn’t “steal” that
Blackhawk, I was borrowing it… Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right
up to Duke.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Matter of fact, I saw that one of my
subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while
back.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I was never asked to join any Op group.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Remember a tall gentleman approaching you in
Thailand when you were on leave, four years ago?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Vaguely.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Right before you tore up the bar?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Four years? My man had some issues. Duke
shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: This doesn’t look like any Tac Op I’ve ever
seen. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Okay, you trusted me by going with my team, so
I’ll trust you. There’s a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM
begins to descend. They pass the URBAN COMBAT LEVEL where MEN and WOMEN
are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Technically, GI JOE doesn’t exist. But if it
did, it’d be comprised of the top men and women from the best military
units all over the world. The alpha dogs… They see a pretty woman sip
into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which reflects and refracts light, making her
nearly invisible.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Oh man, I want one of those.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: The suit or the girl?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Both. Scarlett’s eyes roll. They descend
into the DESERT COMBAT level, where soldiers train with desert warfare
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Ten nations signed on in their first year.
Working together, sharing intel. Now we have twenty- three.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ve never seen combat gear this sleek, what’s
the trick?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Liquid armor. They reach the DEEP SEA
COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and women are testing fantastic
next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Good news is we’ve been pretty successful so
far. The bad news is whenever we manage to shut down one organization,
another springs up in its place.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Who could possibly fund all this?</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Oprah.</p>
<p><strong>control room technician #1</strong>: Mr. McCullen’s standing
by, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Patch him through, please.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: So who hit us out there?</p>
<p><strong>cover girl</strong>: Currently unidentified.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: And how’d that bitch in leather get a
jump jet like ours?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Whoever she is, she’s clearly well-
financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art
weaponry. Their capabilities are beyond anything we’ve ever
encountered.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: That’s the reason we got our asses kicked.
Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We’re going to need to find out everything we
can about her. Knowing is half the battle.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What’s the other half? McCullen now appears
next to Ripcord and walks through him.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Jesus! And we realize McCullen is here
courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR. A ring of cameras provides him with images
of the Joes.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Gentlemen, this is James McCullen, CEO of MARS
Industries, the man who built these warheads. WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE
WITH McCullen standing in front of a HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere.
THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of hawk, Duke, and the others around him.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: General, most men I’ve encountered in this
business over-promise and under-deliver. You’re the opposite. Clearly,
you were the security option I should have chosen.</p>
<p><strong>on duke</strong>: Steaming behind his military demeanor.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: My team did everything we could out there. A
lot of good men went down–</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: –But not you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That mission was classified, sir. Clearly,
somebody sold us out.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I’ve spent ten years and thirteen billion
Euros creating these four warheads. Your job, Captain, was to protect
them, and if it wasn’t for General Hawk, you would’ve failed.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s not a fair assessment. He followed his
orders to the letter.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Well that wasn’t enough. Duke bristles.
McCullen turns to Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: What are your coordinates? I’ll have NATO
send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads, company strength
this time.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It’s not that I don’t
trust you…I don’t trust anybody.</p>
<p>****: Are you sure you’re not a McCullen?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I don’t talk smooth enough to be a
McCullen.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: You do just fine, General. Now, so the
bastards who attacked you can’t find you, you need to disable the
tracking beacon hidden in the case.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: We already have.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Good man. So, can I count on you to
deliver the warheads to NATO now?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I think it unwise to expose them at the
moment. This group might make another attempt.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We need to find and neutralize them before we
can consider moving your weapons.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Alright. But allow me to check the
warheads to see if any have been damaged. Duke begrudgingly sets the
case down. Breaker turns on his suit’s BALL-EYEPIECE. It goes into X-RAY
MODE and we see the NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four
warheads.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Open it, please.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: My scan says they’re intact…</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: General?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: What’s the code? ON DUKE, listening
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Five-two-nine-four-four-oh. Breaker enters
the code. As the case opens, Breaker discreetly watches McCullen in his
BALL-EYEPIECE SCANNER. McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the
warheads. Satisfied, he turns to Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Please keep me informed of your progress,
General. Duke and McCullen share a quick glare. And then McCullen cuts
the feed. Scarlett notices concern on Breaker’s face.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Breaker?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: That bloke’s Beta waves were going up,
down, and sideways… I think he’s hiding something. And off the faces of
the rest of the group WE CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I spend five years setting this up.
Wringing money out of NATO. This was supposed to be the easy part.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: If you’d let me stage the assault at your
precious factory, we could have contained the situation.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: And lost the trust of our clients in the
process? It had to be NATO’s fault. What happened? Did you hesitate?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You’re implying this was about some ancient
history? That’s as laughable as your Intel. What went wrong was the Joes
appearing out of nowhere. He stares at her suspiciously, then
softens.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Forgive me, jealousy isn’t my strong
suit.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Forget that, where are we now? Have you tracked
the case?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: They deactivated the beacon. I gave them a
code to quietly re-arm it. McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on,
displaying A MAP OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the
Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: There it is. The infamous Pit.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I will get those warheads back.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: If I were really there, I might actually let
you touch me.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I’ll send a jet.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Business first. Besides, I’m married, remember?
Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Sometimes I really hate technology. He
sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: It is most often used by those without
honor. McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean man
whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other side of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: There can’t be any more mistakes. The
schedule can’t be compromised any further.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: If you had sent me, it would be
done.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I’m sending you now, Storm Shadow. To the
Baroness’s villa. .Make sure her commitment doesn’t waiver. Storm Shadow
nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now realize Storm Shadow was
a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Good to be back.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: we’ve been very busy. He gestures to
TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all standing at attention,
not a single muscle moving among them. These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest
of the bad.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Is it working?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: You tell me. The Doctor beckons a
waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a glass case containing an eighteen
foot long KING COBRA. the Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: The King Cobra is a magnificent
creature. Its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite.
He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing its hood. The
Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows McCullen an INCISION SCAR
behind the Neo-Vipers’ right ears.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: We introduced into each subject one
thousand cc’s of the nano-mite solution. As expected, subjects became
extremely ill and fell into a coma-like state for approximately forty
hours. The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket, A
FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device’s screen.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: When they returned to sentience, brain
scans showed complete inactivity in the self-preservation region of the
cortex.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: English, Doctor. The Doctor keys a demand
and that particular Neo-Viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the
case through a portal.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: They feel no fear. The Neo-Viper grabs
the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites his arm, latching on, sinking
its venom into his veins. The Neo-Viper doesn’t even wince.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Cortical nerve clusters revealed
complete inactivity–</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: –Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: They feel no pain. The Doctor keys
another command and the Neo-Viper obediently lets go of the cobra and
removes his arm from the case.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Frontal lobe concepts of morality are
disengaged… No remorse…</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: And they are completely obedient?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Of course. .The real world applications
are endless.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: The nano-mites will target the venom.
STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES rushing to
meet the venom head on. Blocking it. Then swiftly pushing it back. All
the way to the original fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and
drips off the Neo-Viper’s arm. He stands and returns to his place in
line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: So you tell me: is it working?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: The science is staggering isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: You’ve done well. You’ve thrown the caber
clear out of the yard.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: But research and science are expensive
propositions. If I can make a suggestion..? McCullen stops and looks at
him, there is something truly menacing and evil behind this Doctor’s
mask.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Selling one batch of warheads on the
black market could fund–</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: –I appreciate your thirst for knowledge,
Doctor. But this world is messy enough. Factions fighting and scrabbling
for control, for resources, and it’s only going to get worse as the
century progresses. No. What the world needs is unification.
Leadership.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: It needs to be taken out of chaos by
someone with complete control. He looks through a portal into a shadowy
OPERATING CHAMBER, where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being
scanned by SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change
Zartan’s fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: My family was once this close to that kind
of power…</p>
<p>****: The French… Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a
nod. McCullen looks back at the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Once I get my hands on the reins, the
money will take care of itself. You’ll be able to do all the research
you want. McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty’s
helmet cam. Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and
whispers:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hey, that’s– Duke cuts him off with a look.
Breaker extracts a full 3D FRONT-VIEW of Ana’s face from the photo. Then
on an adjacent monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF
WOMEN.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Now we can run the face through an infinity
scan.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: We have access to any photograph on any server
anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Everyone gets photographed in some way at
some time. ATM machines, airports, crowd shots at a football game. We’ll
find her. Duke just stares at Ana’s photo. Ripcord whispers quietly:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: .what happened to her? For once, Ripcord
doesn’t know what to say. Cover Girl walks in and hands a document to
Hawk, who looks through it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: From NATO. I am now the official custodian of
the warheads. Your mission is complete. Once you hand it over, that is.
Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: When you move it, she’s gonna come after you,
you know that, right? And with her Intel, and her toys… she’ll find
you.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: And your point is…?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re going to go after her first. And I want
to help.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Let us in on this, General. Our team just
got wasted. I think a little payback is in order.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: You don’t ask to be a part of GI JOE. You get
asked.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You scouted me four years ago, now I’m ready.
Let’s have at it.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I’ve lost men too, Captain. Good men. But
attempting to–</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I know her.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You said knowing is half the battle. Well, I
know who she is. Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and
shows Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer looking,
staring lovingly at Duke as they’re about to kiss.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can tell you
everything you need to know about her until… four years ago. After that,
well, obviously sa lot’s changed. Hawk just stares in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Before this goes any further, I need to know
what I’m dealing with, a man looking to settle a score, or a man who can
put the mission first. Because the battlefield is the wrong place for
emotion. Could you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: If I had to.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Chances are you will. But if you flinch,
hesitate even an instant… what I’m trying to say is, unless you can kill
her graveyard dead I don’t want you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I can. I signed on to deliver those warheads,
General, and despite your present authority, I want to finish the job.
Hawk regards him for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: So tell me about her.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Okay, I’ll start right here: I hope that vault
is tight, because she always gets what she wants…</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: How is work at the lab?</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Steady progress.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: So the Minister of Defense was pleased?</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: He was. You know I wish I could tell you
more…</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: You were gone a long time. How were the
shops in Monte Carlo?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I didn’t get what I was after. They head up the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: I suppose I should be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Most husbands would be.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Most husbands don’t have such mysterious
wives, they know exactly where they are and what they do.</p>
<p>****: They think they know.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I never get over how beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Neither do I. She spots Storm Shadow
standing in an ante room and quickly spins to face her husband. She
pulls Decobray close and kisses him. Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana
warns him off with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at
Decobray.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Let me change and freshen up and I’ll meet you
for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Of course. Decobray smiles at her and
leaves. The smile falls from Ana’s face as she spins around and heads
for Storm Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: Mr. McCullen gave me explicit orders
to sever the Baron’s spine if he so much as touched you.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: He’s my husband, of course he touches me. Tell
McCullen to grow up. Besides, the Baron says his work in the lab goes
much better after we’ve… touched. And that’s the important thing.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: I’ll be accompanying you to retrieve
the warheads this time. Along with some of the men the Doctor’s been
working on.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: The Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: We go at dawn. Storm Shadow turns and
heads out through the doors. Ana Stands alone in her room now, she heads
over to her dresser and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX.
She opens it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside. Something
sad and lonely in her eyes… And WE FLASHBACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: My hot tub only holds four.</p>
<p>****: No, five.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ve been wanting to do this before we
deploy.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Duke…it’s beautiful. It’s too nice you
lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Only time I’m buying one of these, so why not?
They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws up his face,
worried?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Well, what do you say? She’s too emotional to
speak. And then they hear:</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Say yes, you idiot…! Lieutenant REX LEWIS
saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his collar. The look on his face tells
us he’s happy for them.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: .Before I tell my new brother-in- law what it’s
like to share a bathroom with you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: I was coming to offer you a ride back to
post.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Time already?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: We go at oh-five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Is it WMDs? It is, right? That’s why you’re
pulling Rex out of the</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ana, we can’t–</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top Secret. Have to
kill me if you told me, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Speaking of classified information, you still
haven’t answered.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Yes. Of course it’s yes. On one</p>
<p><strong>condition–</strong>: She grabs REX and pulls him down on his
knees next to Duke.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Promise me that you won’t let my genius egghead
brother get hurt. He’s the only family I’ve got left. Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I promise. She smiles and holds out her hand.
He threads the ring onto her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his
eyes is a glint of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through
shuttered doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Jesus, Rip. Ripcord rolls over and yells back
through the doors:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: How was I supposed know she was married!?
Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m done proposing.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I already said yes.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Not official until you answer my question.
Do you love my boy?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Always and forever. Ripcord flips open his CELL
PHONE and takes the photo of Ana that Duke carries with him.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Now I’ve gotta find someone to love me, as
many times as possible for the next three hours. WE PUSH IN ON THE
PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: If you want to join us, you’ll need to
be mission ready, Joe style. This is the Mark One Accelerator Suit.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What’s it accelerate?</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: You. It’ll make you run faster, jump
higher, and hit harder than any of your enemies. A TITANIUM BOOT slides
over a shoe. COBALT MACHINE PARTS snap into place with a HISS over Duke
and Rip’s arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and
highly-pressurized pneumatics. They both slap on aerodynamic,
flying-wing HELMETS. Inside, the CYBERNETIC POWER-UP with an ear
piercing whine. LASER ENHANCED LED readouts scramble and fritz across
their HUDs.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: An advanced cybernetics heads-up
display, feeding into your helmet. Duke checks out two gas-propelled
GRAPPLING SPEARS and six WRIST ROCKETS around his right forearm.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Two gas propelled grappling spears and
six ten millimeter, hi- explosive, heat seeking, fire-and- forget
rockers. Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on his
left forearm. A Cheshire grin spreads across his face.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: And a nine millimeter, caseless
submachine gun with six hundred rounds capable of firing all of them in
thirty seconds. Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for
the FLEXIBLE, POLY-ALLOY SUITS. Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I just missed everything you said. How do I
look? Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But not good
enough. Gotta get under a minute to qualify.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’s the record?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Don’t tell me, Snake-Eyes?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: No, me. Ripcord glances at Scarlett’s
CROSSBOW PISTOL.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You can do this whole course with that
thing in forty-five seconds?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: If you’re going to shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise take up knitting.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: When I want something, I don’t just shoot
at it… When I get a target in my sights, I take it down. His meaning is
clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and
hands it to him.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Here. Go on. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I wouldn’t want to show you up.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Oh, that’s so thoughtful of you.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What can I tell you? I guess I’m just a
considerate, humble guy. You’ll learn that about me.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I’m the “target in your sights,” right?
You’ve got ten rounds to “take me down”.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I don’t want to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: They’re training arrows. The most I’ll
feel is a little jolt.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: C’mon, Rip. Ripcord tries harder, genuinely
doing his best. But Scarlett us too fast. Ducking and weaving around
Ripcord, as nimble as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord’s
feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She leaps up onto
a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath. He fires again as she
lands, ducks under it and rolls up to him. He fires his last bolt point
blank. She catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the
chamber. Slamming her body up against his. Right hand behind his head,
left hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer. Ripcord’s
eyes on hers as he whispers:</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Guess you didn’t really want me that bad,
rip. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she walks
away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the ground and
EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord glances at the underside
of the pistol’s magazine. Three words: “CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS”. Both men
watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the course, awestruck.
Breaker walks by eating a burrito and watching his bio-rhythm
display.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Aw, Ripcord’s heart just skipped a beat.
Isn’t that sweet?</p>
<p><strong>security technician #1</strong>: Sensors detecting seismic
activity to the southwest. Probably just a tremor, but have a team check
it.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Again. They go at each other, fast and
furious, the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins
and attempts a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes’ earlier move. Snake-Eyes
blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke’s feet, taking him down hard before
finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again, the Joes react.
Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once
more.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet
deep. No going under. Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the
wall. And then there’s a crashing sound as one of the wall girders
bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it. Ana can
hear the engine grind to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: If we don’t get him out he’ll suffocate. Storm
Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Just thought I’d mention it.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: All that matters is the mission. Ana
pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six STEEL BLUE
BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED SCHEMATIC of the Pit,
showing rooms and people moving about them. She points down a tunnel
beyond the electrified fence. Storm Shadow gestures to one of the
Neo-Vipers. The Man immediately walks over and grabs the fence,
electricity JOLTS him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily
starts climbing the fence. The skin on his hands and arms starts to burn
and bubble.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: Acceptable collateral damage.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Is there any other? Near the top the Man
finally falls backward and drops down dead. Storm Shadow nods to the
next Viper. Without hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence.
He is immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling. This
guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and crashes to the ground,
then crawls over and pulls the OFF SWITCH, cutting the electricity
before dropping dead himself. Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly
scale the fence.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: You can learn a whole hell of a lot
about a girl by the way she dances. Tell me I’m wrong Snake-Eyes.
Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: See? He agrees.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: No, he doesn’t. Do you? This time
Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: See, he knows you have to listen to get to
know someone. Right, Rip? Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear,
glances over.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What? You say something? Breaker sits at a
chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with Heavy D on
this one.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Like my man says, get a girl on the floor,
you don’t just see how she moves, you get the smell of her. What
biologists tell us is that the decision is made by he nose long before
the rest of the body gets involved. It’s a question of pheromones.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: You’re going to teach me science? I read
all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex
pheromones when I was twelve. I’m just saying, it’s not very romantic.
Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Heavy told me she graduated college at
twelve. No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: She’s like a freaky genius. A deadly,
freaky genius.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You like her, I get it already.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: You can’t learn this stuff in a book,
Scarlett. You have to at least kiss a guy, before you’re an expert on
romance. The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Who am I shooting first? The laughter
stops. Rip looks surprised.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You haven’t kissed anyone? Now Scarlett
looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he could take his words back.
Duke just shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Really firing on all cylinders there, Rip.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: All I know is, when the bass get’s that
booty shaking in the right way, I’m in the skin like a man named Flynn.
Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show of disgust.
Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hell with it. He strides across the room
toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Into the Valley of Death rode the</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Beach reading, huh? She groans and lowers
the book only slightly.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the wrong
foot… Without changing expression she goes back to her book.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Okay look, I’m attracted to you. And you,
you’re attracted to me. And him– The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but
what I’m saying is–</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: “We’re attracted to one another.”</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: That’s what you’re saying, not what I’m
saying.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Okay, what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Attraction is an emotion. Emotions are not
based in science. And if you can’t quantify or prove that something
exists, well, in my mind… it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Okay, I’ll get back to you on that. And he
walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in. Everyone comes to
attention.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Duke, You scored in the top half- percent of
all people we’ve ever tested. Rip, well, if we average your scores with
Duke’s, you pass too. Welcome aboard, provisionally. But we still need
to see if you pass muster in the field. Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and
rip nod back with pride.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!</p>
<p><strong>cover girl</strong>: Sorry to disturb you, general.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: That’s all right, Cover Girl. What am I
signing now? Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her
chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind her. Hawk
grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two swords. One slices the
barrel of the pistol clean off, the other buries itself in Hawk’s gut.
Hawk collapses. Ana steps forward and rips the General’s SECURITY BADGE
off his jacket. Hawk’s eyes follow them as they leave. He glances at a
RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it, giving everything
he’s got, until he finally hits the button.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: The warheads. They all rush out of the doors.
Breaker stops to change a chess piece on the board before racing
out.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They can’t be far.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Put the case down, Ana, Rip trains his gun on
Storm Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: And you get out of that…thing. Stalemate.
Storm Shadow doesn’t move. Ana turns and looks at Duke. Sets the case
down, her voice is gentle.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Fine. Done. Then she takes a step toward
Duke.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stop, Ana. Stop right there. But she doesn’t.
She just keeps slowly moving toward him.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You can’t shoot me, can you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I will if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Deep down, you’re still the same man I fell in
love with.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t force this, Ana.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: What could have been, right, Duke? You beside
your best man. Me walking down the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Don’t listen to her, Duke. Was I really
going to be your best man?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Don’t make me do this god-damnit!</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: “Don’t make me do this?” A recurring theme in
your life, right Duke? She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol
right at her forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a
glance.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Move and I’ll blow her away. Get the
briefcase. Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the
trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves slowly
forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch from the extended
barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to feel each other’s breath. Their
eyes lock.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Do it, Duke. .You already killed me once. And
in Duke’s eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord passes Ana, and
wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at Duke’s pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT
GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half
with one sword and about to kill him with the other. When suddenly,
Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake- Eyes’ KATANA BLADE saves
Ripcord’s life by a half inch. The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and
immediately open fire, pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell
breaks loose. Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords
flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face- to-face,
staring hard into each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>****: Hello brother. Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the
moment to elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana
grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I believe you’ve got my luggage. Ana
stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her shot tears the
CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett’s hands. Ana’s got her dead-to-rights
until Scarlett triggers her CAMO- SUIT, melting into nothing right in
front of Ana. Ana doesn’t spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she’s
stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her pistol is
knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but that’s just as quickly
twisted out of her grasp and dropped. Ana fights the invisible Scarlett
as best she can, but Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her. Ripcord
and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow climbs back into
the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks.
Ana grabs an OIL PAN and flings the oil, which sprays over everything,
including Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks
her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her. Storm
Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, powered by an arc
of blue light shooting out of its engine pack. He quickly swoops towards
the two women and grabs ana by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the
weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing
pad. The battle raging below them. Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but
they vanish up into the next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action,
takes out the last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett
who’s nursing her neck.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How many warheads?</p>
<p><strong>staffer #1</strong>: Four, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Any threats? Any demands?</p>
<p><strong>staffer #1</strong>: None so far, sir.</p>
<p><strong>staffer #2</strong>: We take this to mean the terrorists are
unfocused, no clear goals. The President stops, glancing gravely back at
his staff.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: No, .it means they’re going to use
them.</p>
<p><strong>- day</strong>: opening. Ana McCullen gazes a the IRON MASK
we and Storm Sh saw his ance adow watc in the h onndual HOLOstor</p>
<p><strong>projectors.</strong>: This belonged jo E mine. He was c t an
old ancestor o f to both sides. aught sellin g arms They forced wear it
the rest to his life .</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Why do you keep at it? So that I MCCULLENne ver
forget the most important rul e in dealing arms. Never sell to STORM
SHADOWboth sides?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Never get caught. McCullen carefully puts
the mask back in its ca se.</p>
<p>****: Take the warheads N them wea Paris. Have ized. Then to test pon
one. I want you Test one?ANA</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I don’t wan t you until leaving Paris that
they’ve you;re sure that the work, been properly y weaponized.</p>
<p>****: We’ll let CNN show everyone how w ell they perform. I want them
to fear me. It will be STORM SHADOWdone.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I have a target french will never in mind,
one the forget.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: As I have never forgotten what the French
did to Clan McCullen.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?</p>
<p><strong>zartan</strong>: This is going to be the achievement of a
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: For you and me both.</p>
<p><strong>zartan</strong>: Eighteen months of studying the subject,
learning the mannerisms, adopting his eating habits, losing sixty
percent of my muscle mas…</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Your commitment has been inspiring.
McCullen enters.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Gentlemen. About to get under way? Zartan
raises his PDA.</p>
<p><strong>zartan</strong>: Once the ledgers are all square.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Check your account. Zartan checks the PDA.
McCullen shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: It’s always about the money.</p>
<p><strong>zartan</strong>: It’s a useful tool. You should understand
that. Ah! The transfer just hit my account. Zartan puts the PDA aside,
leans back on the gurney and</p>
<p><strong>zartan</strong>: Let’s do this. The Doctor straps Zartan
down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS which converge on Zartan, injecting
his body with dozens of long needles. He remains conscious, not feeling
any pain. WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind his
right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES into Zartan’s
head. Zartan’s eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM and fight his restraints
as the nano-mites begin to reshape his appearance, reforming facial
bones and changing the texture and elasticity of his skin and even
changing the color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks
disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>inside the temple</strong>: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in
through the Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he
takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED CLAN
MARKINGS on his forearm, it’s a young Storm Shadow, healthy, wealthy,
and well fed.</p>
<p><strong>young storm shadow</strong>: Thief ! He picks up the KITCHEN
KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake- Eyes, who blocks the strike with the
rice pot. They fight fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of
utensils and furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but
Storm Shadow’s classic training gives him the edge. He finally traps
Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his face. He starts to
choke Snake-Eyes with his foot …</p>
<p><strong>hard master</strong>: Enough! Storm Shadow! A Ninja Master
steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.</p>
<p><strong>young storm shadow</strong>: Father, he was stealing. We need
to call the magistrate.</p>
<p><strong>hard master</strong>: He is hungry. We need to invite him in
and show him the way.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: He’s a cur! A Frenchie!</p>
<p><strong>hard master</strong>: He doesn’t fight like one. The two
young warriors glare at one another.</p>
<p><strong>hard master</strong>: Now what shall be your clan name?
Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes furiously. Hard
Master just smiles, AHl</p>
<p><strong>and we flash back to</strong>: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool,
he stands up and walk off…</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Jesus, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You’re not fine, let me look at that.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I looked at it, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Take it easy, just trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I know what you’re trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: And what is that exactly?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You know, not every guy you meet is an
asshole. You do know that, don’t you? Scarlett stops and returns to the
sink, he ignores her, cleaning the blood off his face. She softens.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: It’s not you, I… I didn’t really want
anyone to… see me in here.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I don’t know. All the people we lost last
night. General Hawk… My neck is not that important.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You almost died. You’re allowed to be
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: First fight I’ve lost since I was a kid.
My father would be… he was my instructor.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Think he’s be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: He taught me to win.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I don’t know how you teach anybody to win
at everything every time.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: But I do know you can teach someone to get
up when they get knocked down. Ripcord turn her gently in the
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Look at you. Still here. Maybe this is what
he wanted you to learn. Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: But of course, that would be an emotional
response, one that can’t be explained or quantified. Ripcord turns and
heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: We’re not a couple. Snake-Eyes and me.
We’re… close, he’s like a brother, but… we’re not a couple. Ripcord
looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: Can you kill her? And then WE FLASHBACK TO:
Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on her face. Squeezing harder, harder.
Pure evil.</p>
<p>****: That ought to hold you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Graveyard dead.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on the
theory behind them at Oxford. They’ve been surgically implanted behind
the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Theoretically, the possibilities are
endless. Increase their speed, agility, resilience. You program, they
perform. That’s the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much
whatever you want it to.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mind control?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I don’t see why not.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be
McCullen. Doing an inside job on his own warheads.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: You may be right. Maybe he needed NATO to
pay for his R D.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: The weapons case! Everyone stops and looks
at Ripcord like he’s nuts.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Remember he had us open the case for him.
Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’ll bet that code he gave us like
re-activated the tracking beacon or something. Looks pass among the
group, it starts to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: And who says you’re not a thinker. All of the
sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: I think I found her…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, you found her all right.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if
you’re feeling formal.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Wow, she traded up, huh? I mean…
financially.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Baron DeCobray. Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Lab? Breaker call up an image of DeCobray
standing in front of a huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other
scientists.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Particle accelerator.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: They’re gonna use him to weaponize the
warheads.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s where she’s going.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Who likes croissants?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and
assault the main lab… Rex–uh, .the science officer, stays back with
Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building. Alpha holds
the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs. Five minutes
before extraction and the airstrike. The squad nods. Duke looks to Rex
again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show it. Duke hands him a piece of
gum.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Double Bubble? Rex takes it. Duke blows a
bubble, smiles at Rex.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Always helps me. You good?</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Yeah… They chew their gum.</p>
<p><strong>down in the village</strong>: Duke leads a frontal assault of
the main building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives hand
signals along with his commands.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Go, Bravo. Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the
door of the building. They disappear inside. Rex, a kit bag over his
shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to
him puts a hand on his shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals “ALL CLEAR.” Duke
double taps Rex on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’re good to go, Rex. You don’t find it in
four minutes, get out of there, because that house won’t be standing in
five. I already called for the air strike. Rex nods. Duke gives him a
smile. Rex takes off and runs low to the door, entering the house. Duke
watches him go, then looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of
mortars. Duke takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then
the mortar rounds start to hit. The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in
the air, as Duke, Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover. We catch
glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle, firing. Duke and
Ripcord pop up and return fire.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’ve gotta level with ya!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I hate it when you level with me.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Gonna be a long five minutes. Duke just
grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the distance, RUMBLING coming
from the sonic roar of JETS.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I love that sound… But then he looks to
Duke, confusion on his face.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, no, no… It’s too soon.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The F-16s in formation streaking toward
them across the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Rex. Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire
and mortar explosions all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker
buster. Duke dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke
is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely registers
the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles toward the smoking.
Flaming rubble that was the building. The Blackhawk comes sweeping low,
ready for extraction, the tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black
smoke washes over Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Blackhawk’s waiting. Come on, we’ve got
wounded! And incoming enemy! Lots of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Nothing you can do. Come on…! Gunfire
bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from the ruins of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Good Morning. Baroness.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Good morning. Gene. My husband’s expecting
me.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Absolument. The Security Guard opens
the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab drives up to the building.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Ana…?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I need you to do something for me and I don’t
have much time.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Who is this? She beckons Storm Shadow who
sets the weapons case down on DeCobray’s desk, opening it up to reveal
the four NANOTECH WARHEADS and their launchers. DeCobray stares,
bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: I don’t understand… what are these things?
What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: They’re warheads, dear. And I need you to
weaponize them for me… .or we’ll kill everyone in here. DeCobray stares
at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who removes a GLOCK PISTOL
from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN. Chaos erupts. DeCobray shouts to
the room, calming the others somewhat. He stares at Ana and Storm
Shadow, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: This is a civilian laboratory. We don’t
have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing…</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: The protocols are in the case. I told you, I
don’t have much time. DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the
Brawler, watch our back. The rest of us will break into the lab with the
accelerator suits. Once the warheads are weaponized, they’ll be
extremely volatile. We can’t afford to let any of them go off inside the
city. Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What about you? Don’t you get a suit?
Snake-Eyes just looks at him, “Are you kidding me?”</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: He doesn’t need one.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Firing. DeCobray hits a switch. The
PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and begins hurling atoms through miles and
miles of underground tunnels. Inside the accelerator, the four warheads
begin to spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER – then, as the power grows, they
begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin. Ana and Storm Shadow
watch with mild curiosity as the noise inside the chamber builds. The
atoms catapulting faster and faster through the tunnels, bombarding the
warheads again and again. Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out. And the
warheads slowly sink back down and stop spinning. DeCobray keys another
button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER emerges from the accelerator.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: Careful… they’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Thank you, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>decobray</strong>: I think I have never seen the face of evil
until I looked at you now. Ana looks at him and falters, something in
his words piercing her hard veneer. She feels Storm Shadow watching her
and with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again. She drop a SEALED
ENVELOPE on DeCobray’s desk and heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Adieu. DeCobray watches her go, then opens the
envelope. We see the LARGE HEADER printed on the first page: “ACCORD DE
DIVORCE”.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: That’s them! Snake-Eyes is already moving,
lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto the street as the Brawler still moves,
running right at the Scarab which turns to get away. Scarlett
immediately follows him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator
suit. Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at the
Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside. Then she fires at Snake-Eyes and
Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts nail Scarlett. She crashes
hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Keep going! With that, he leaps after the
Scarab, just grabbing the back of the vehicle as it tears away. The
Brawler stops right next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator
suit</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Don’t worry about me, go and help
Snake-Eyes! Duke doesn’t need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Careful. They’re worth millions of dollars…
each.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Millions of dollars, got it. He promptly
trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself up. Gets hit by a car.
Picks himself up again.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Sorry! Excusem moil Won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Christ, they just shot right through a
bus!</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: They’re turning the corner. Go through that
building at 6 o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: There’s no door!</p>
<p><strong>breaker’s voice</strong>: Make one! Duke charges directly at
the building. Ripcord reluctantly following as Duke smashes through the
wall into…</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around.
Storm Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR SUITS.
Hands it to Ana.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy if
I let you die. Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: How thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Look at the moves they’re making, they’re
heading somewhere. Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: This’s their route from the lab. On the
screen, they see the lab, the current position of the Scarab, and what
lies just ahead. . .the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>****: Metal… Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: Guys, you have to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, we’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: I mean right now. They’re going to
detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower. Ripcord glances up and
sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Oh, man… Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls
out his GLOCK PISTOL and fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT
TIRES, which promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the
vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks. Snake-Eyes sees
something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a
METRO TRAIN barrels into the Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air,
hood-over-tailpipe. Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke
manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the
train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and PLUNGES headlong
into a window on the side of the train…</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty/breaker</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p>****: You guys okay?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I went through the train. What happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I jumped over it.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You can do that?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, you didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>inside the scarab</strong>: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead.
Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her
red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana
leap out. Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from
the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: C’mon! Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord,
charging after them.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: How do you say “we’re the good guys” in
French? Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under
the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.</p>
<p><strong>on the first floor</strong>: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the
stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite
side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a gun on them but Storm
Shadow snatches the weapon out of the man’s hands, swatting him with the
butt, all without missing a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming
for the stairs– –where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The
avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the stairway,
however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net. He
makes it to the first floor and races after Ana and Storm Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett’s
first out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them carrying
weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry
up to the stairway. Guns go up. Scarlett speaks to them urgently in
French.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Don’t shoot! We’re a special anti-
terrorist unit! There’s a bomb up there! POLICE CARS are now rushing up
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>on the second floor</strong>: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over
to the main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow
hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case and
removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH. Through the
stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind.
Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him
with the Security Guard’s pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares
defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the
warhead. A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: Everyone hears the warhead
detonate.</p>
<p><strong>on the first floor</strong>: Duke and Ripcord freeze.</p>
<p><strong>on the second floor</strong>: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads
out in all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and hits a
button for the top. The elevator races upwards as everything else gets
eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The floor begins to disappear.
Tourists stampede towards the stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her
MOTHER’S GRIP. The mother screams out for her child as the girl goes
over the railing.</p>
<p><strong>on the first floor</strong>: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip
see her coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time.
Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes. Duke sees
Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists. He leaps up
onto the iron lattice.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Each warhead has a kill switch.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: It’s too late! We gotta get off this
thing!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Those nano-mites will level the entire city!
Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit. Rip
things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms,
who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of
people down the stairs. The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below
them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate
the Tower.</p>
<p><strong>inside the elevator</strong>: Ana and Storm Shadow race to
the top.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>in the skies</strong>: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards
the top of the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.</p>
<p><strong>on the tower</strong>: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES
chasing him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just
above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION CANNONS at Duke,
knocking him off the tower. He falls, but manages to catch the tower
just below, the NANO-MITES almost on top of him now. The climbs even
faster.</p>
<p><strong>on the top deck</strong>: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm
Shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers up
beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower groans and
wobbles. It’s a long way down. Time has run out. Ana and Storm Shadow
jump into the Typhoon.</p>
<p><strong>in the typhoon</strong>: The gunship rocks with his sudden
weight. Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs
inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL SWITCH from Ana,
pressing the trigger. Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and
fall to the ground around the Eiffel Tower. The Tower groans,
half-eaten, then topples over on its side. Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry
out of the way as it crashes down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous
explosion of water. The shock on the faces of everyone around
reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his eyes on the
Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets an idea.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Come on! He hauls-ass.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You just saved Paris. Storm Shadow is not happy
at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops hard to the floor of the Typhoon.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Plugging into his cerebral cortex. With a
SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the top of the
Neo-Viper’s head. Ripcord winces at the sight.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: The brain survives for a couple of minutes
after death. We can read his most recent memories.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Can you find Duke?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: If this guy remembers the way home we
can.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker’s
HUD. Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway, driving
the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN on the Neo-Viper’s
open eyes and CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Destroy that unit immediately. The Doctor
removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo- Viper’s file. He
clicks a button that reads “TERMINATE”.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: He’s still alive!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: He’s not alive.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: You ever seen a dead guy do that?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: They activated a self-destruct. The
Neo-Viper’s body starts to decay before them. Thousands of NANO-MITES
literally eating away at his flesh and bones.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Nano-mites!</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: They’re eating him!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Hurry, Breaker! But the NANO-MITES are too
fast. The Neo-Viper’s legs are now gone. His chest and arms next.
Breaker rapidly scans through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES
consume his head.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You did the best you could.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Relax, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: You got it?</p>
<p>****: Well, what was the “NOO!” for?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: That was for McCullen. There is the sound
of weapons being raised. The team looks to see they are surrounded by
FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.</p>
<p><strong>french swat captain</strong>: Put your hands in the air! The
Joes trade looks, shrug and raise their hands.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: The onl about i Dukendly force I care</p>

<p><strong>breaker</strong>: –Start an international incident.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’m not gonna just sit here!</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: This is bigger than Duke.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: What if it was one of you? What if they had
Heavy or Scarlett, what would you do? The Joes trade looks - rock and a
hard place.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We’re not doing Duke a damned bit of good
sitting here. If it was reversed, Duke would be kicking down every door
between here and the freakin’ moon ’til he found me.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: And we’ll do the same for him as soon as
we get out of here. She has a thought and turns to Breaker.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Partial? You said partial latitude and
longitude.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: We only got the one coordinate– 90 degrees,
then the image went to snow.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Maybe it was the whole coordinate, just 90
degrees latitude.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Before the image went to snow,…it’s the
polar ice cap. RIP’S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The
Joes all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: They did away with the guillotine, right?
They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in a
wheelchair, back turned. When he spins around, it’s Hawk.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: General! Hawk just shakes his head and
sighs heavily.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: How long before we’re released?</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The French government is allowing you to leave
on the condition that none of you ever return. Other agencies will be
handling this from here on.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett/ripcord</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: The heads of state of every member of GI JOE
are recalling their operatives. We are now considered a rogue unit,
uncontrollable. Shut down. We’re to report to Washington for debriefing.
Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: That’s it? They’ve got Duke!</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: I said you were to report to Washington. I
didn’t say when, or which route to take.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Maybe a northern one. Hawk smiles and
wheels out the door.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: He thinks I should kill you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: James wants to meet you in person.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: James?</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Mr McCullen.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ana listen–</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: –Talk softly, or he’ll tazer you again.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Loosen these, he’ll never taser anything
again. She taps the bonds on his wrists.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I should’ve thought of this before. They almost
share a smile.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Let me get this straight. You’re with
McCullen. You’re married to that Baron. And you claim you’re still in
love with me.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I’m a complex woman.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe you just don’t know who you are
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Who I was died long ago.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, this isn’t you, I still see the person I
loved behind your eyes. Her eyes soften for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Tell me what she was like.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: She was smart, and funny. She was loyal as
hell. She loved those she was close with, me, her brother… I did my
best. With Rex. I’m sorry. He was my responsibility. I should have… It’s
why I left, Ana. Why I couldn’t be with you. You were in so much pain… I
thought the sight of me just give you more. She seems to be affected by
this ever so slightly, then… a hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she
shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: It doesn’t matter now.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: No, it matters very much. We have the chance
to make things right.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Nothing will ever be right again. Duke stares
at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON the two of them and
FLASHBACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: NO! McCullen has plans for him! Storm Shadow
throws a star, it whistles across the cave and nails Duke in his
shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers back up, but the Neo-Vipers are
already on him, they start beating the living shit out of him. Ana jogs
up.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Enough! Storm Shadow picks up the case and
looks at Duke, face down, bloody and beaten.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: And what was your plan? Run three
thousand miles across the ice? He rips his star out of Duke’s shoulder.
Duke sucks it up.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: Stupid soldier. Duke rolls over and
stares up at them, breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: That’s a lotta ice.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: It’s gonna be like trying to find whale
spit in the ocean. Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his
Ball-Eyepiece.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: That’s strange.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: When they stole the weapons case, I set my
suit to scan for the tracker beacon in case it came back on, and it just
came back on. Ripcord just smiles.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: That’s my boy.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Certain work needs to be done away from the
public eye.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Take them to the drones. I want them ready
to launch in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: It will be done. And only then does
McCullen greet Ana.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: My beautiful Lady of the Lake… He kisses
her. Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned affection, her eyes open
and on Duke. Duke stands there, impassive. McCullen finishes the kiss
and turns to Duke.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: This bother you? Duke says nothing, so
McCullen steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Isn’t it funny, with the entire balance of
power in the world about to shift, a couple of guys can still have a
stare down over who gets the girl. Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD
BUTT McCullen. The Neo- Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor.
McCullen wipes a small trickle of blood from his nose.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: The interesting thing about my Neo- Vipers
is they still think the same thoughts they always did, they just can’t
act on them anymore. Instead, they do what I want. I imagine that must
be very frustrating. He gets right down in Duke’s face.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I’m going to make you very unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m already happy. McCullen glances at Ana,
watching the display with conflicted eyes. McCullen heads for the door,
beckoning the Neo-Vipers to make Duke follow him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What’re you gonna do with the warheads?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: You take to your training well, that’s
good. Still trying to develop information. Still planning to escape and
stope me. Moments from now, you’ll see that won’t ever happen.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Then you won’t mind telling me.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Isn’t it clear? I’m a business man. I’m
going to use them.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Millions of people are gonna die if you launch
those warheads. What is it you want, McCullen?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Merely to strike fear into the hearts of
every man, woman, and child on the planet. Only then will they look up
to the man who wields the most power, and obey him.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Meet the genius behind all my
nanotechnology.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: My genius lies only in taking what
others created to the logical next steps. All modern gains in science
are made through theft.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: You’ll have to excuse his modesty, when I
found him, he was –</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: –Another “recruit”?</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Albeit a rather unwilling one. The
Doctor’s nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions. When you
wake up, you’ll be working for me, and your past will be a distant
shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I’ll prepare him for the surgery. The
Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him towards another
door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look. McCullen keeps his eyes on
her as she watches him go.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Picture’s coming on line now.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: It’s an underwater facility…</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: McCullen’s home away from home.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Dukes’ gotta be in there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Wait, what’s that? Breaker ZOOMS IN on a
massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Oh, Jesus…That’s an automated, phased array
turbo-pulse battery. A really big gun.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Could it take out our sub?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: That thing could take out a dozen subs
simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Then that’s our first objective.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: No, no. Duke’s our first objective.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: The main force can’t attack as long as
that cannon’s online.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: How you figure getting it offline?
Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Elevator cables. They’ve got a surface
entrance. Shipwreck? She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR
“SHIPWRECK” DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.</p>
<p><strong>shipwreck</strong>: Going up, senorita? Scarlett nods and
leads the others down a corridor.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will
infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon. Heavy D, as
soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Go, Joes…</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: All drones prepared and ready, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Good, commence the launch sequence
immediately. is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana’s
face?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: That McCullen’s got some gadgets. Breaker
gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana sword to slice a
circle in the wall and yank it out, revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES,
but no diving bell.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Maybe we could slide down. Snake-Eyes
shakes his head, doubtful</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: The arctic water would kill us.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Three… two… one… ignite primary engines.
The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill with fire.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We lost one.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Lost one? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Bird Three is down, Sir. McCullen looks
at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles.</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: We’re under attack.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Alert all defences. Charge up the pulse
cannon. He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: What about the other two?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: We find the kill switches and short out the
nano-mites.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: They’re already way out of range.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Then somebody has to go up there and shoot
those things down.</p>
<p>****: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Can you even fly this thing?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I can fly anything. You just track those
warheads and guide me in. We don’t have long until they hit.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Ripcord? He glances at her, a moment
between them. Then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth. He
stares back at her.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Do me a favor? Save Duke. She gives him a
nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: The atomic bomb that was dropped on
Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city. Seventy percent… Did
you know that, Duke?</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: There was a bank situated less than one hundred
yards from Ground Zero, destroyed of course. Only one thing survived.
It’s four bank vaults. And when those vaults were opened, they
discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Of course, the vault I took shelter in
wasn’t that well-made. He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the
mask to reveal a scarred and burned face.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Double Bubble? Duke is beyond
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Rex… Rex immediately has trouble breathing and
returns the mask over his face.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You sonuvabitch… Ana buried you.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: A moving ceremony, I’m sure. The three
volley salute. The flag on the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why? .Why didn’t you come in…?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Because I found out the truth…</p>
<p><strong>and we flashback to: jungle building - day</strong>: Rex
moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo.</p>
<p><strong>brave soldier</strong>: Intel says the lab’s in the basement.
Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a staircase
toward the basement. Rex follows, nervous as hell. The soldiers round a
corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he freezes, then silence, Rex pulls
out his .45 And rounds the corner to see Fireteam Bravo down. A GUARD is
trying to clear a jam in his machine gun. As he clears the weapon and
raises it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first. The Guard drops. Rex
checks Bravo, but they’re not moving. He looks around the basement, no
lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed. He heads for the vault,
45 raised, breathing hard. WHOOSH, a blast of refrigerated air hits him
as he opens the door. Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS
in huge FORMALDEHYDE JARS&gt; Something inside the animals is constantly
reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and changing
the color, texture and elasticity of their skins. There is a scuffling
noise, Rex points his gun. A small, stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat
appears.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Are you going to shoot me?… Rex doesn’t
respond.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: We knew you were coming. But I couldn’t
walk away from it… Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: Stay where you are. His gun up, he finds a
COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing various files, starts reading
them.</p>
<p><strong>rex</strong>: These aren’t chemical or nuclear–</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: No. Something much… better.</p>
<p><strong>res</strong>: This is beyond anything… This is light years
ahead of anyone in the field.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: You see why I couldn’t leave. Rex nods,
hypnotized by the science in front of him, an instant bond formed with
the man who created it. The distant sound of Jets. The Scientist moves
to the vault door and begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam
Bunker Buster whistling towards them.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: If we live, I’ll show you everything…</p>
<p><strong>we smash cut back to the medical wing - present</strong>:
Duke tries to absorb what he’s learned. The Doctor continues.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: The man who created this technology was
not our enemy. In fact, he was hired by our very own government to
create it. When it was deemed too unethical, they sent us to kill him.
He didn’t survive the blast. But I… lived. And I escaped with his
research. Unfortunately I tested it on myself first, and lost my lungs
and vocal chords in the process. But now I’ve perfected it, and you will
get a first-hand experience.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Does Ana know about this, about you?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: No… and she never will. He glances at
the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You sick bastard… you did this to your own
sister?</p>
<p>****: I loved my sister! Do you have any idea the state she was in?
Me dead. You AWOL. Depression, drugs.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: So, I had her brought here, gave her a
way to deal with her pain, gave her purpose. Made her strong. I gave her
a new life, Duke.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why work for McCullen?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: He saved my life, for starters. Now to
mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s bullshit. You could have had any job
you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I didn’t want any job. You can’t play
nice with science, Duke. It’s sometimes necessary to experiment, to
fail, even to destroy to attain a goal. It’s a fact that McCullen has
the guts to embrace.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Everything she’s done, everything she’s
become, started because she thought you died that day.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: And because you then abandoned her,
let’s not forget that part. And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART
ROBOTS, which menacingly begin to move in.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: It’s pressure plated and laser protected.
Anyway around it?</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: No. Any object larger than a quarter will
fry your britches. Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps
forward and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: What you’ll have to do is rewire the laser
panel’s brain by– –Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips
while his other fingers grab his sword and STAB the laser panel. The
sound of the laser net instantly vanishes.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: .or you cold just stab it.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I don’t have much time. She rushes over and
unties him and they stare at each other, then kiss passionately. All of
a sudden, Duke feels something behind her right ear, he turns her head,
–an INCISION SCAR. He looks at her, but before he can say anything,
Ana’s body snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Ana! Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding
his PDA, McCullen and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke
and Ana. Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Let’s get in this fight.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Okay, I’ve got a lock on the two remaining
warheads. Target one is Moscow! Target Two is Washington!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Give Ripcord the coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>shipwreck</strong>: The hull’s been ruptured!</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Everyone into the attack boats!</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Keep tight everybody. He fires a HARPOON
TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis craft RETURN FIRE. The whole
area explodes in a pulse fire and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine
sinks and EXPLODES at the base of the facility.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Is she still alive?</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: You said this couldn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I didn’t think it could. I’ve never seen
anyone defeat the programming, even momentarily. Duke recovers and
angrily grabs one of Ana’s PISTOLS and kills the two Neo-Vipers, then
turns the gun on the others. The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the
“TERMINATE” BUTTON.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: If I press this, Ana dies.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Your choice, Duke.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Put it down! The Doctor doesn’t move. McCullen
watches the stand-off his right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out
from his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I see it, dead ahead.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: You have to knock it down before it
re-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites don’t reach the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Uh, I’ve got a problem. The fire controls
are not in here.</p>
<p><strong>breaker’s voice</strong>: What do you mean, not in there?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I mean I can’t see them anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: It’s gotta be voice-activated.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: You have to say the words into your flight
helmet.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Fire! Shoot! Blast away! Still nothing, the
missile streaking onwards towards the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord’s voice</strong>: Nothing’s happening!</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Must be a different language.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Try “teine”.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: It’s Scottish for fire.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Teine.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Listen to my voice, “Teine”.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Teine! Teine! Teine! It’s not working!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: That’s because you’re not saying
it right!</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: How many different ways you want me to say
it?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: One way! The right way! Teine!</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Teine! And at last the PULSE LASER fires.
Blasting the missile out of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats
aimlessly away.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Nice work, Ace. You just saved Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Just doing my job. Guide me to the other
drone…</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: .man, I freakin’ saved Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How soon will it strike the city?</p>
<p><strong>staffer</strong>: Seventeen minutes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This will be a disaster the likes of
which we have never seen. As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS
INDUSTRIES LOGO on the doors.</p>
<p><strong>shipwreck</strong>: That cannon’s going to kill us all.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: My guy will take care of it, trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>staffer</strong>: It seems somebody’s shot down the warhead
heading for Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Thank God… As he says this, a SECRET
SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED PISTOL and kills the other Agents and
Staff. We see an INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a
Neo- Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo- Viper
holds his pistol on the President as–</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Second drone in my sights.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Hurry, Rip. You’ve only got thirty seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Taine! But nothing happens. Scarlett’s
voice yells in his head.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: Teine! Teine!</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Don’t yell at me!</p>
<p><strong>scarlett’s voice</strong>: Teine. Ripcord takes a breath,
stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT starts beeping on his control
board. Rip does his best to ignore it, focusing on the missile as it
begins to disappear into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster
and louder.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Teine! The LASER PULSE fires, blasting
straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For
a moment, he can’t tell if he hit it or not.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: You missed! The warhead has entered the
lower atmosphere!</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Did you think she loved you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Stay back!</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Did you imagine your life with her?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I said stay back!</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: Don’t you know you’ve lost, Duke?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: All I know is that neither of you deserves
her. McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand– –A BURST
OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires the PULSE PISTOL at it.
The intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway
between them and blows them back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his
face is literally burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then
yanks McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then grabs
the PDA, removing Ana’s screen with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: You’re too close, Rip. Back up.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Actually, I think I’m just about close
enough…</p>
<p>****: .teine. The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES
right in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD OF
NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Ripcord? What happened? Rip!</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: He’s taking the nano-mites back up into the
upper atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Cur magh! The canopy explodes. Rip shoots
back down into the atmosphere as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven,
then float away…</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: He did it… He actually did it…</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Ripcord? Talk to me…Ripcord! Still
nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:</p>
<p><strong>ripcord’s voice</strong>: I asked you not to yell at me.
Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: What happened? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ripcord’s voice</strong>: Yeah, did it work?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Yes…yes, it worked.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: Good…cause I think I’m about to get
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>flash back to</strong>: The cannon fires and the lasers
disappear, freeing them to continue their duel. This is it. The final
duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm Shadow puts in
every ounce of hate he has left. He finally tears Snake-Eyes’ sword away
and kicks him down. About to go for the final kill. But before we find
out the climax to their fight, we must finish their story: ON THE
ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks along the pond.
He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a run, careens around a
building and sees Hard Master slumped on the ground, a sword in his
back.</p>
<p><strong>snake-eyes</strong>: Master! Other NINJAS come flooding
in.</p>
<p><strong>ninja #1</strong>: That’s Storm Shadow’s sword!</p>
<p><strong>ninja #2</strong>: There! There’s the murderer!</p>
<p><strong>storm shadow</strong>: You took your vow of silence to avenge
our Master. But now you will die without a word. The LOUD NOISE gears up
again, distracting Storm Shadow for just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the
moment to catch Storm shadow with his feet, holding him up for a split
second as the ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply
across Storm Shadow’s neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls OVER
THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake- Eyes steps up
and looks down to see if he surfaces… He doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>snake-eyes</strong>: Father always feared it would come to
this. EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles
towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: Turbo-laser is down! He guns his
engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls
with delight. Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle.
A SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe harpoon
cannons.</p>
<p><strong>breaker</strong>: Energy overload in the phased array
battery. Power subsystems are going critical.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Let’s get out of here! Scarlett grabs
Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls him out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: Snake! Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks
Scarlett in the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>snake-eyes</strong>: .he’s dead. She knows who he means, she
gives him a grim smile. And that’s when they see Duke, carrying Ana,
charging up to them. Another EXPLOSION makes them all dash into the
diving bell. The doors close and we hear them launch.</p>
<p><strong>heavy duty</strong>: We got a runner! Cut him off! All of a
sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>inside the diving bell</strong>: Our heroes are rocked by the
BLAST, then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from the
ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and DEMOLISHING the
remainder of the facility. The Trident disappears behind the trillions
of bubbles and falling ice.</p>
<p><strong>shipwreck</strong>: All other targets neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: I guess I should thank you, Doctor. The
Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I want you to call me… Commander. And
from now on, I’ll be on a first name basis with you, Destro. McCullen’s
silver face goes blank.</p>
<p><strong>mccullen</strong>: Yes, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Physically, she’s fine. But without the
correctly-coded kill frequency, we can’t short them out.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: There’s nothing you can do?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Only the man who put them in there has
the correct code. Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll visit you.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: I won’t be here long.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You’ll be here for the rest of your life, Ana.
She looks at him, her face softening.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: Duke?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: After all I’ve done, .you can’t save me, .it’s
too late. A BEAT passes between them.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll visit you. And for a moment, she appears
to crack… but then a sinister smile creases her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ana</strong>: You know, this has only just begun. She touches
his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between them. She holds his
eyes a moment longer, then the two Prison Guards lead her away. Duke
just watches her go, his face torn with pain. He walks off alone…</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>: With GI JOE reinstated, would you boys like to
stay on awhile?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What do you say, Rip? Ripcord looks at
Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: I’m good. They all laugh. Rip steps up to
her.</p>
<p><strong>ripcord</strong>: So how do you feel about this?</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: I feel very… emotional. Duke smiles and
the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.</p>
