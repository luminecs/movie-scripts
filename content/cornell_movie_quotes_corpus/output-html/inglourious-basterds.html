<p><strong>ext - dairy farm- day</strong>: The modest dairy farm in the
countryside of Nancy, France . We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the
farm house;</p>
<p><strong>nazi occupied france”</strong>: This SUBTITLE disappears, and
is replaced by another one;</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is
hanging up laundry on the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed
sheet, she hears a noise, moving the sheet aside she see’s;</p>
<p><strong>julie’s pov:</strong>: A Nazi town car convertible, with two
little nazi flags attached to the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel,
a NAZI OFFICER alone in the back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS
on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to
their farm.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Pappa. The French Farmer sinks his axe in the
stump, looks over his shoulder, and see’s the Germans approaching. The
FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home, followed by
her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans approaching. The
Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Go back inside and shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Julie, get me some water from the pump to
wash up with, then get inside with your mother. The young lady runs to
the water pump by the house. She picks up a basin, and begins pumping,
after a few pumps, water comes out splashing into the basin. The French
Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls
a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off his face, and waits
for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a year with the sword of
Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end. Julie
finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window sill.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ready Pappa.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Thank you darling, now go inside and take
care of your mother. Don’t run. Julie walks inside the farm house and
closes the door behind her. As her father stands up from his stump, and
moves over to the window sill with the water basin… .The SOUND of the
ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER. The Farmer SPLASHES
water from the basin on his face and down his front. He takes a towel
off a nail, and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he
watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four
representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his
property. We don’t move into them, but keep observing them from a
distance, like the Farmer. The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their
bikes, and standing at attention next to them. The NAZI DRIVER has
walked around the automobile, and opened the door for his superior. The
NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;</p>
<p><strong>nazi officer</strong>: This is the property of Perrier
LaPadite?</p>
<p><strong>nazi driver</strong>: Yes heer Colonel. The Nazi officer
climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying in his left hand n d</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Herman, until I summon you, I am to be left
alone.</p>
<p><strong>nazi driver</strong>: As you wish Heer Col. The S.S. COLONEL
yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>nazi officer</strong>: Is this the property of Perrier
LaPadite?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: I am Perrier LaPadite. The S.S. Colonel
crosses the distance between them with long strides, and says in French
with a smile on his face;</p>
<p><strong>nazi officer</strong>: It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S. COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers
the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand. The Frenchman takes the
German hand in his and shakes it.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: How may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I was hoping you could invite me inside
your home and we may have a discussion.</p>
<p><strong>int - lapadite farm house - day</strong>: The door to the
farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor the S.S. COL to
enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap, inside the Frenchman’s home. Col
Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife, and
three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his
direction. The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Colonel Landa, this is my family. The S.S.
COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the French Farmers
Wife…</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at
your service. He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of
his hostess hand…</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.</p>
<p><strong>farmers wife</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, heer Col. While
still holding the French Woman’s hand, and looking into her eyes, The
S.S. Colonel says;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a
beautiful woman. His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three
daughters.</p>
<p>****: And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Merci. Please have a seat. The Farmer
offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden dinner table. The
Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer, and lowers himself into
the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on the table, and keeping his black
attache case on the floor by his feet. The Farmer turns to his Wife and
says;</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
The Colonel some wine?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
wine. This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have
milk?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Then milk is what I prefer.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Very Well. The mother of three, takes a
craft of milk out of the ice box, and pours a tall glass of the fresh
white liquid for The Colonel. The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from
the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur, to both your family, and your
cows, I say; Bravo.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Please, join me at your table.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Very well. The French Farmer sit’s at his
wooden dinner table across from The Nazi. The Women remain standing. Col
Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
discuss,’ would be better discussed in private. You’ll notice, I left my
men outdoors- if it wouldn’t offend them, could you ask your lovely
ladies to step outside.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: You are right.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife
follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter’s taking them
outside, closing the door behind them. The Two Men are alone, at the
farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you
I’ve exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so
inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me. However, I’ve been lead
to believe you speak English quite well?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for
the remainder of the conversation?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: By all means. They now speak ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very
familiar with you, and your family. I have no way of knowing if you are
familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? The Farmer
answers;</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: This is good. Are you aware of the job
I’ve been ordered to carry out in France?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Please tell me what you’ve heard?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: I’ve heard, the fuhrer has put you in
charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or
passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: The Fuhrer couldn’t of said it better
himself.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I’m aware of that, I read the report on
this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there’s
always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete
waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have A few
questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my
department can close the file on your family. Taking his black leather
attache case, and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from
inside. He also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform
front pocket. Opening the folder, and referring to it;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Now before the occupation there were four
Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. The
Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus’s, is that
correct?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: To my knowledge those were the Jewish
families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you
if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
house, make yourself comfortable. The Farmer gets up from the table,
goes to his shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX
that contains all the fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table
with his Nazi guest. As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with
tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red
hot, the S.S. Colonel studies the papers in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Now according to these papers, all the
Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The
Dreyfusis. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have
vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve ether made good
their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them. his papers,
across the table at The</p>
<p>****: What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Only rumors -</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: - I love rumors! Facts can be so
misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling. So Monsieur
LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis? The
Farmerlooks at Landa.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want to
hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you. The Farmer puffs
thoughtfully on his pipe.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard
the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: So the rumors you’ve heard have been of
escape?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
friendly? As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind
his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards revealing;</p>
<p><strong>five human beings</strong>: lying vertically underneath the
farmers floorboards. These human beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have
lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year.
But one couldn’t call what The Dreyfusis have done for the last year
living. This family has done the only thing they could, hidden from a
occupying army that wishes to exterminate them.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: We were families in the same community, in
the same bussiness. I wouldn’t say we were friends, but members of the
same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this
answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you
confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: There were five of them. The father, Jacob…
.wife, Miram… her brother, Bob …</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: - How old is Bob?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Thirty - thirty one?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: And the children… Amos… and Shoshanna.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Ages of the children?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna, was
fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.</p>
<p><strong>uxt - dairy farm - day</strong>: The Mother and her three
Daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothes line. They can’t
hear anything going on inside. e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three
Daughters.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Well I guess that should do it. Be begins
gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his ttache case. the
Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: But of course. Farmer stands up, goes over
to the ice box, and takes out the aft of milk. As he walks over and
fills the Nazi Colonel’s glass, German Officer talks.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given me?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: I have no interest in such things.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: But you are aware of what they call
me?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: I’m aware.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: What are you aware of?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: That they call you, “The Jew Hunter”.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Precisely! Now I understand your
trepidation in repeating it. Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him.
Actually why he would hate the name, “The Hangman”, is baffling to me It
would appear he did everything in his power to earn it. But I, on the
other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I’ve earned it.
As “The Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with
the french farmer.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: The feature that makes me such a
effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I
can think like a jew. where they can only think like a German, or more
precisely, a German soldier. Now if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and
predatory instinct of a hawk.</p>
<p>****: Negro’s - gorilla’s - brain - lips - smell - physical strength
- penis size. But, if one were to determine what attributes the jews
share with a beast, it would be that of the rat. Now the Fuhrer and
Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our
conclusions differ, is I don’t consider the comparison a insult.
Consider for a moment, the world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world
indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now,
would you greet it with hostility?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: I suppose I would.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Has a rat ever done anything to you to
create this animosity you feel toward them?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Rat’s spread disease, they bite people
-</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a practise of biting human
beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some
time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a
day in your life? I purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a
squirrel could equally carry. Yet I assume you don’t share the same
animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Yet, they are both rodent’s, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the
other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look
alike, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: It is a interesting thought, beer
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: However, interesting as the thought may
be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to
scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer
of your delicious milk?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I didn’t think so. You don’t like them.
You don’t really know why you don’t like them. All you know is, you find
them repulsive.</p>
<p><strong>metaphor</strong>: What a tremendously hostile world a rat
must endure. Yet, not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason
for this, is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and
presavation second to none. And that Monsieur, is what a jew shares with
a rat. Consequently, a German soldier, conducts a search of a house
suspected of hiding jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the
barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar - he looks
everywhere, he would hide. But there are many places it would never
occur to a hawk to hide. However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my
Alps in Austria, and placed me in French cow country today, is because
it does occur to me. Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon dignity. May I smoke my pipe as
well? Th e Farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Please, Cononel, make yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: The other mistake the German soldier make
is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the
Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply
confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war
creates. These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be
reminded of their duty in war time. Let’s use you as a example Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a
conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or
your cows - yet, here you are. So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a
question. In this time of war, what is your number one duty? Is it to
fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or, is it
to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability? Or, is it to
protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect
themselfs? Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to
protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family? The
Colonel lets the last statement stand.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: That was a question Monsieur LaPadite. In
this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: To protect my family.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Now, my job dictates, that I must have my
men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before I can
officially cross your families name off my list.</p>
<p>****: And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured,
they will be. That is unless, you have something to tell me that will
make the conducting of a search unnecessary.</p>
<p>****: I might add also, that any information that makes the
preforming of My duty easier, will not be met with punishment. Actually
quite the contrary, it will be met with reward. And that reward will be,
your family will cease to be harassed in anyway, by the German military
during the rest of our occupation of your country. The Farmer, pipe in
mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: You are sheltering enemies of the state,
are you not?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Your sheltering them underneath your
floorboards aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Point out to me the area’s where their
hiding. The Farmer points out the area’s on the floor with the Dreyfusis
are underneath.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Since I haven’t heard any disturbance, I
assume that while their listening, they don’t speak english?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I’m going to switch back to french now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade - is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>perrier</strong>: Yes. Colonel Landa stands up from the
table, and switching to FRENCH says</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for milk,
and your hospitably. I do believe our business here is done. The Nazi
Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his son to
approach the house.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Mademoiselle LaPadite, I thank you for
your time, we shant be bothering your family any longer. Yet the
LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers, machine guns at ready, approach
the house. The Soldiers enter the doorway, Col Landa, silently points
out area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite I bid
you adieu. otions to the Soldiers with his index finger. wy TEAR UP the
wood floor with MACHINE GUN FIRE. The little farm house is filled with

With a hand motion from the Colonel, the Soldiers cut off their gunfire.
The Colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence.</p>

<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Herman, I sense` a question on your lips?
Out with it?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state to
escape?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Oh, I don’t think the state is in too
much danger, do you?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I suppose not.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I’m glad you see it my way. Besides, not
putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl, and allowing
her to escape, our not nessessarlly the same thing. She’s a young girl,
no food, no shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the massacre of her
entire family. She may not survive the night. And after word spreads
about what happened today, it’s highly unlikely she will find any
willing farmers to extend her aid. If I had to guess her fate, I’d say
she’ll probably be turned in by some neighbour. Or, she’ll be spotted by
some German soldier. Or, we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from
starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps-she’ll survive. She will elude
capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York city.
Where she will be elected, President of the United States. The S.S.
Colonel chuckles at his little funny.</p>
<p><strong>ext - somewhere in england - day</strong>: A bunch of
SOLDIERS are lined up at attention. LIEUTENANT ALDO.RAINE, a hillbilly
from the mountains of Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the
men, the Germans will later call; “The Basterds”. Lt.Aldo has one
defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his neck. As if
once upon a time,. he survived a LYNCHING. The scar will never once be
mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: My name is Lt.Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin
together a special team. And I need me eight soldiers. Eight - Jewish -
American - soldiers. Now y’all might of heard rumors about the armada
happening soon. Well, we’ll be leavin a little earlier. We’re gonna be
dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we’re in enemy
territory, as a bushwackin, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be doin one
thing, and thing only, Killin Nazi’s. The Members of the National
Socialist Party, have conquered Europe through murder, torture,
intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do to
them. Now I don’t know bout y’all? But I sure as hell, didnt come down
from the goddamn Smoky mountains, cross five thousand miles of water,
fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin
air-o-plane, to teach the Nazi’s lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got no
humanity. There the foot soldiers of a Jew hatin, mass murderin manic,
and they need to be destroyed. That’s why any and every son-of-a–bitch
we find wearin a Nazi uniform, there gonna die.</p>
<p>****: We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty, they
will know who we are. They will find the evidence of our cruelty, in the
disembowed, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we
leave behind us. And the German will not be able to help themselves from
imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot
heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Germans, will be sickened by
us. And the Germans, will talk about us. And the Germans, will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night, and their sub conscious
tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be with thoughts of us,
that it tortures them with. He stops pacing, and looks at everybody.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Sound good? They all say;</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: That’s what I like to hear. But I got a
word of warning to all would-be warriors. When you join my command, you
take on debit. A debit you owe me, personally. Every man under my
command, owes me, one hundred nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all
y’all will git me, one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one
hundred dead Nazi’s… .or you will die trying.</p>
<p><strong>ext - mountain top chalet- day</strong>: A huge Chalet on a
misty mountain top in Barvia.</p>
<p><strong>int - burstich garden - day</strong>: In a huge room, ADOLPH
HITLER, pounds on a big table with his fist, as he rants at TWO GERMAN
GENERALS. They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: How much more of these jew swine must I
endure? They butcher my men like they were fish bait! This pack of
filthy degenerates, are doing what the Russian army didn’t, and Patton’s
army couldn’t. Turning soldiers of The Third Reich, into superstitious
old women!</p>
<p><strong>german general</strong>: Just the cowards among them mine
Fuhrer. Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard the
rumors myself! Solders of The Third Reich, who have brought the world to
there knee`s, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the
latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their fear induced delirium? The
one that beats my boys with a bat. The one they call “The Bear Jew”…is a
Golem. A avenging jew angel, conjured up by a vengeful rabbi, to smite
the Aryans!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers gossip,
no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Why not? They seem to be able to elude
capture like a aberration. They seem to be able to appear and disappear
at will.</p>
<p>****: You want to prove their flesh and blood? Then BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the eiffel tower! And then
throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast! The
Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and wipe his greasy
black hair out of his face.</p>
<p>****: The Bear Jew. He hits the button on the intercom on his
desk.</p>
<p><strong>kliest1</strong>: KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom;</p>
<p><strong>kliest’s voice</strong>: Year mine Fuhrer.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: I have a order I want relayed to all German
soldiers stationed in France. The Jew degenerate known as The Bear Jew,
hence forth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again. We will
cease to aid the Americans any longer in there attempt to undermine the
German soldier psyche. Did you get that Kliest?</p>
<p><strong>kliest’s voice</strong>: Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Who and what is a private Butz?</p>
<p><strong>kelist’s voice</strong>: He’s the soldier you wanted to see
personally. His squad was ambushed by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it’s only
survivor.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Indeed I do want to see him, thank you for
reminding me. Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>cu face of dead german soldier</strong>: His head lies on the
ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead
German patriots helmet, and grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair.
A LARGE KNIFE ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE. This
process is called SCALPING. After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily
peels off like a banana.</p>
<p><strong>german prisoners pvt.butz and sgt.rachtman</strong>: on their
knees, hands behind there heads. Private Butz NARRATES the scene in
GERMAN SUBTITLED into</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: Werner and I were the only ones left alive
after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
All The Basterds wore German scalps tied to their belts.</p>
<p><strong>cu scalps</strong>: hanging from belts.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: They not only took valuables…</p>
<p><strong>we see quick cuts of</strong>: Rings, Weapons, Iron Cross,
and somebody digging out a Gold Tooth with a knife, being removed from
Dead Germans.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: ..They also took their identification
papers.</p>
<p><strong>cu identification papers</strong>: taken from the inside
pocket of a dead German uniform.</p>
<p><strong>basterd pfc.utivich</strong>: flips through the I.D. papers
till he gets to the page that contains the German soldiers, name,
statistics, and photo.</p>
<p><strong>pfc.utivich</strong>: Sigfried Muller.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: .and tore out the identification page.
Utivich RIPS the page out, and sticks it in his pocket. Tossing the torn
book on the dead, scalpless body.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: …They then removed their boots…</p>
<p><strong>cu german combat boots</strong>: laces untied.. .boot pulled
off…</p>
<p><strong>socks</strong>: removed, reveling dead bare feet…</p>
<p><strong>basterds</strong>: tossing the boots off a hill.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: Throwing them away from the bodies…</p>
<p><strong>dead germans</strong>: scalps removed from their heads, pink
bare feet…</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: The Basterds, took their lives, their
hair, their valuables, their identity, and finally their dignity in
death. True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob
the tableaux of a certain dignity, that is normally felt in battlefield
shots.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: The dogsl He fights his frustration,
then…</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>back to the basterds</strong>: Aldo screams to The Basterd
who’s guarding the two German prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Hey Hirschberg, send that kraut sarge
over.</p>
<p><strong>basterd pfc.hirschberg</strong>: KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the
back.</p>
<p><strong>pfc.hirschberg</strong>: You! Go! Sgt.Rachtman is a little
slow to respond. So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his
feet, and KICKS him in the ass, sending him on his way. Most of The
Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with Aldo in the middle. As
Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds, A OFF SCREEN
LITERARY NARRATOR speaks over the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he’s ever been on the wrong end of the exchange. It’s
always been his belief, only a weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence. As Werner watched
men cry like women, pleadingly offer their knowledge, in exchange for
their worthless lives, he made a vow to himself. If his role is to die
in this conflict. When they put him under the earth, his dignity would
be buried with him. For in the other world, the gods only respect the
ones they test first. Well Sgt, this is your test. And the gods are
watching. The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds, stands
straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and salutes his
captor.</p>
<p>****: Sgt.Werner Rachtman. Aldo returns the salute, looking up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha. You
know what sit down means Werner?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Then sit down.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Hows your English Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta a couple fellas can translate. Aldo points at one of The
Basterds in the circle,</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the fuck
outta Saltzberg, while the gettin was good. Became American, got
drafted, and came back to give y’all what for. Then Aldo points to
another Basterd. A big scary looking Basterd, in a German Sgt’s uniform,
named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: And another one over there, you might be
familiar with, Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz. Heard of ’em. The two German Sgt’s
look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: Everybody in the German army’s heard
of Hugo Stiglitz. The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back. The
NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s celebrity
among German soldiers is simple. WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front
page of the Nazi version of Stars and Stripes .</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As a German enlisted man, he killed
thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly Majors.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Instead of putting him up against a wall,
the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin, to be made a
example of. Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
prison convoy, enroute to Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Needless to say, once The Basterds heard
about him, he never got there.</p>
<p><strong>ext- french countryside - day</strong>: The Basterds AMBUSH
the prison convoy, killing everybody. They walk to the back of the troop
truck, inside Hugo in chains, stares back at them.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz? Hugo nods.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: I’m Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are The
Basterds. Ever heard of us? Hugo nods his head, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your
work. When it comes to killin Nazi’s, I think you show great talent, and
I pride myself on havin a eye for that kind of talent. But your status
as a Nazi killer, is still amateur. We all came here to see, if you
wanna go pro?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who
we are?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: Aldo the Apache. The circle of
Basterds giggle.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Well Werner, if you heard of us, you
probably heard, we ain’t in the prisoner takin business. We in the
killin Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin. The Basterds
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Now that leaves two ways we can play this
out. Either kill ya, or let ya go. Now weather or not you gonna leave
this circle alive, depends entirely on you. Aldo takes out a map of the
area, and lays it out in front of his prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Up the road a piece, there’s a orchard.
’sides you, we know there’s another kraut patrol fuckin around here
somewhere. Now if that patrol were to have any crackshots, that orchard,
would be a goddamn snipers delight. Now if you ever wanna eat a
sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map, where they
are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me, what
kinda artillery they carrying with ’em?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: You can’t expect me to divulge
information that would put German lives in danger?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: well, Werner that’s where your wrong.
Because that’s exactly what I expect. I need to know about Germans hidin
in trees? And you need to tell me? And you need to tell me, right now?
Now take your finger, and point out on this map, where this partys bein
held, how manys comin, and what they brought to play with? Werner site,
head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero
facing death.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.werner</strong>: F I respectfully refuse, sir. Aldo jerks
his thumb behind him.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: You see that ole boy battin rocks? WE RACK
FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle. He’s wearing a wife
beater, and power hitting stones with a baseball bat. Werners eyes go to
the ballplayer.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: That’s Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you might
know him better by his nickname, The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of Aldo
the Apache, you gotta heard about The Bear Jew?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: He beats German soldiers with a
club.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: He bashes their brains in with a baseball
bat, what he does.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: back to us, still haven’t seen his
face. He Babe Ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Now Werner, I’m gonna ask you one
last-goddamn-time, and if you still, “respectfully refuse”, I’m callin
The Bear Jew over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of his, and
he’s gonna beat your ass to death with it. Now take your wennersitnitzel
lickin finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.rachtman</strong>: Fuck you and your jew dogs.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Actually Werner, we’re all tickled ya said
that. Frankly, watchin Donny beat Nazi’s,to death, is the closest we
ever get to goin to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: he turns to CAMERA, and yells;</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Got a German here wants to die for country.
Oblige him.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donny donowitz</strong>: Bat over his shoulder,
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>int - barber shop - day</strong>: Donny, cutting heads, in
his pop’s barber shop, in Bostin.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: .ya got the goddamn fuckin Germans, declaring
open season on Jews in Europe, and I’m suppose to fly to the fuckin
Philippines, and fight a bunch of fuckin Japs - not me pal. If we just
go in this against the Japs, the whole U.S.of fuckin A can go take a
running jump at the moon.</p>
<p><strong>head</strong>: You know they got a word for what your sayin
Donny, it’s called treason.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Hey, stick your treason up your poop hole. If
I’m gonna kill my fellow man in the name of liberty, that fellow man,
will be German.</p>
<p><strong>int - sporting goods store- day</strong>: MR.GOOROWITZ’S
sporting goods shop in Donny’s Jewish Bostin neighbourhood. Donny walks
in.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: Hello Donny, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Ah, just dandy, Mr.Goorowitz.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: Your mother, your father - everything

<p><strong>donny</strong>: There just fine. I’m shippin off next week.
The store proprietor, extends his hand to the young man.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: Good for you son. Kill one of those
Nazi basterds for me, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: That’s the idea, Mr.Goorowitz.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: What can I do you for, Donny?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: I need a baseball bat. The store owner leads
him to a basket with eight bats init. Donny starts going through them
without saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: You gettin your little brother a
present before you ship out? Donny, concentrating on the bats, not
looking up;</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: No. Donny’s “no”, silences the gabby
Goorowitz. He seems to settle on one, feeling it’s weight in his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Can I try this one on for size, outside?</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: Be my guest. The phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>mr.goorowitz</strong>: I’ll get that, you go right ahead. The
proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a conversation with his OFF
SCREEN Mother. Donny walks outside, WE STAY IN STORE, but can see him
clearly through the stores big picture window. However, Mr.Goorowitz
instinctively, turns his back to Donny to speak with his mother. Donny
starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming beating
somebody to death with it. Then the he starts yelling;</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin
with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews? The American jews are gonna
FUCK with you… ..! Mr.Goorowitz, see’s none of this, as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into the store.
Store owner turns to store customer.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Is this the heaviest ya got?</p>
<p><strong>int - hallway apartment building - day</strong>: Donny,
dressed nice, in a apartment building in his Jewish Bastin
neighbourhood. He knocks on a door. A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the
door, only a little, peering out at the young man.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Mrs.Himmelstein?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: State your business young man.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Mrs.Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz, my
father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on Greeny Ave, “Sy’s Barber
Shop”.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: I’ve seen it. Do you live in the

<p><strong>donny</strong>: All my life.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: Again, state your business?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: May I have a word with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Our people in Europe. She thinks for a beat,
then holds the door open for the young man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: Come in. Would you like some
tea?</p>
<p><strong>int - mrs.himmelstein’s apartment - day</strong>: Donny sits
on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and saucer in his hand.
Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed chair, holding her tea, looking
across at her visitor.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: If you like tea. Donny chuckles at
her little joke. The old woman remains stone. She wasn’t joking. He
places his saucer on the coffee table and begins;</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love ones
over in Europe who your concerned for?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: What compels you young man, to ask
a stranger such a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna
make it right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: And just how do intend to do that,
Joshua?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: And what exactly do you intend to
do with that toy?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to death
with it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: I thought we were having tea
together?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: And in this pursuit, how is it that
I can be of service?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: I’m going through the neighbourhood. If you
have any love ones in Europe, who’s safety you fear for, I’d like you to
write their name on my bat.</p>
<p><strong>back to basterds</strong>: Donny takes a long walk to Werner…
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING, WE

<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: You must be a real BASTERD,
Donny?</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: You bet your sweet ass I am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: Good. A Basterds work is never
done. Specially in Germany. Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at
the Nazi;</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Gimmie your papers. Werner hands Donny up his
papers. Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.himmelstein</strong>: Hand me your sword Gideon. I do
believe I will join you on this journey.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: she signs the BAT, “MADELEINE”</p>

visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: You wanna live?</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Point out on this map, the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the positions.</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: This area here.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: Maybe twelve.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: What kinda of artillery?</p>
<p><strong>pvt.butz</strong>: They have a machine gunn dug in here
pointing north.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: How did you survived this ordel? WE SEE
Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer’s room for the first time. He wears a Nazi cap,
which is unusual in the presence of The Fuhrer, but he seems okay with
it.</p>
<p><strong>prvt.butz</strong>: They let me go.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Now when you report what happened here, you
can’t tell ’em, you told us, what you told us. They’ll shoot ya. But

’em, we let ya live, so you could spread the word through the ranks,

to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he thought it
would, evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t
like that. You see, we like our Nazi’s in uniforms. That way, you can
spot ’em, just like that. But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody
gonna know you was a Nazi. And that don’t sit well with us. Aldo removes
a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin, you
can’t take off.</p>
<p><strong>back to hitler</strong>: Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet,
hair hangs in his face, his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has
been HAND</p>
<p><strong>butz’s pov:</strong>: on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has
just carved the swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All The
Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: You know Lieutenant, your getting
pretty good at that.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
don’t ’ch? Practice.</p>
<p><strong>“german night in paris”</strong>: NOTE: This whole Chapter
will be filmed in French New Wave Black and White.</p>
<p><strong>int - cinema auditorium - night</strong>: We’re in the
auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the CAMERA is pointed in the
direction of the audience, not the screen. We start CLOSE on the
projector beam, emanating from the little glass window in the back of
the theatre The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider
and Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens of
Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark We can hear
the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced German omm paw paw
musical movie being projected. The Shot continues to pull further and
further back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the
auditorium…</p>
<p><strong>till…</strong>: .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of
Shosanna,. watching the movie.</p>
<p><strong>of shosanna’s family”</strong>: We hear the sound of the
German musicals climax. The lights go up in the auditorium. Shosanna,
dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from somewhere, remains seated,
as the rest of the PATRONS, gather their coats, and file out.</p>
<p><strong>ext - little cinema - night</strong>: Patrons exit under the
cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French: “GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in
MADCAP IN MEXICO”.</p>
<p><strong>ext - projection booth</strong>: A French Black Man, who we
will learn later is named MARCEL, is the cinema’s projectionist. We see
him for a moment, taking the film reels off the projector, and placing
them on rewinds.</p>
<p><strong>cu shosanna</strong>: still sitting in her seat. Except for
her, the auditorium is empty. The owner of the Cinema, a attractive
looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears
in one of the cinema’s opera box balconies. Looking down from her perch
at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema. The DIALOGUE will be
spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: So young woman, since it’s beyond
obvious we’re closed for the evening. I must assume you want something.
What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: May I sleep here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: So I gather your not a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: But your a bright little thing,
that’s clever disguise. Where is your family?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Murdered.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: So your a war orphan?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Is this a sad story?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Sad stories bore me. These days
everyone in Paris has one. I haven’t bore you with mine, don’t bore me
with yours.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: You can run the machines?</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: What machines? Using her hands to
pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says;</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: The machines that show the film?</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
of course I can operate them.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I know, I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>cu shosanna</strong>: eyes creeping up the stairway in the
projection booth, watching…</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: expertly working the projectors…</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
that show the film. It’s only you and the negro. I know you could use
some help.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: I know at least six people who’ve
been put up against a wall, and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of
the state. I have no intention of being unlucky number seven. How long
have you been in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: A week, and a few days.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: How have you survived the curfew
without capture?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I sleep on rooftops.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Again, I’m forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Cold.</p>
<p>****: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Respectfully, no you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: So you can’t operate a 35mm film
projector, you want me teach you, in order to work here, in order to use
my cinema, as a hole to hide in, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Whats your name?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Shosanna.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call me
Madame. This is a cinema. Not a home for wayward war orphans. Having
said that, what you say is true. If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So Shosanna, are you truly exceptional?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui Madame.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: I will be the judge of that.</p>
<p><strong>title card:</strong>: Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of
the CITY OF PARIS, complete with Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not
looking at a TITLE CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the
Little Cinema’s Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the Month
is JUNE. ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working as
the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed Madame
Mimieux’s exceptional test. A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the
SOUNDTRACK, this will be “Shosanna’s Theme”. A Little Bell, begins
RINGING, on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna it’s time for a
REEL CHANGE. Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German
film she’s projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK…</p>
<p><strong>silver screen</strong>: of the little cinema. On Screen LENI
REFENSHTAL lies horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
German film, “The White Hell Of Piza Palu”, The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK
POPS ON in the upper right hand corner of the FRAME… .</p>
<p><strong>silver screen</strong>: the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in
the same place .</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR,
switching the film from projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a
perfect REEL CHANGE. As Shosanna’s Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we
watch viva MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film
cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect…</p>
<p><strong>ext - cinema - night</strong>: The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU” Shosanna
emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of LETTERS , and a tall
ladder. Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: To operate a cinema in Paris during the
occupation, one had two choices. Ether you could show new German
propaganda films, produced under the watchful eye of Joseph Goebbels.
Or… .you could have a German night in your weekly schedule, and show
allowed German classic films. Their German night was Thursday. Shosanna,
by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the
marquee. A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER, walks out of the cinema. He sees the
ladder with the young French girl on top, and walks over. They speak
FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: What starts tomorrow? Shosanna looks
down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up at her from below.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: A Max Linder festival.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
Chaplin. Except Linder never made a film as good as “The Rid”. The chase
climax of “The Kid”, superb. Shosanna continues working, not adding to
the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: I suppose now you could use a “M” a
“A” and a “X”?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No need, I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, it’s my
pleasure. He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: I adore your cinema very much.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Merci. She busies herself with the marquee
letters…</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: How does a young girl, such as
yourself, own a cinema? Do to his uniform, and Shosanna’s situation, all
his efforts at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: My aunt left it to me.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Lucky girl. Shosanna makes no reply
back.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Merci for hoisting a German
night.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I don’t have a choice, but your
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Do you chose the German films
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Then my merci stands. I love the
Refensthal mountain films, especially, “Pizu Palu”. It’s nice to see a
French girl who’s a admirer of Refensthal.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: “Admire”, would not be the adjective I
would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: But you do admire the director.
Pabst, don’t you? That’s why you included his name on the marquee. She
climbs down from the ladder and faces the German Private.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I’m French. We respect directors in our
country.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Apparently even Germans.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
Private. Adieu. She turns to go back inside.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Your not finished?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I’ll finish in the morning. She opens the
door to go inside.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: May I ask your name?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: You wish to see my papers? She hands him
her excellently forged papers. That’s obviously not what he meant, but
he takes them anyway to read her name.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very
pretty name.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Merci. Are you finished with my papers? He
hands them back.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick
Zoller. She gives no response.</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: It’s been a pleasure chatting with a
fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle. He gives her a little
salute, and walks into the black of a curfew imposed night. She looks
after him. She didn’t show it, but he kinda got to her. After all, for
any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody who, CINEMA MON
AMOUR.</p>
<p><strong>ext - rooftop cinema - night</strong>: Shosanna stands on the
roof of her cinema, late at night, lighting up a cigarette. As she takes
her first big drag, she remembers a voice.</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and
the black projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna lights
up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face HARD, knocking the
cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel quickly STAMPS it out on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: if I ever see you light up a
cigarette in my cinema again, I’ll turn you into the Nazi’s, do you
understand? Shosanna is shocked by this statement.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: And for bringing a open flame in my
cinema, you deserve far worse then a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that’s what!
In my collection, I have over 350, 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
not only immensely flammable, but highly unstable. And should they catch
fire, they burn three times faster then paper. If that happens..
.POOF…all gone, cinema no more, every body burned alive. If I ever see
you with a open flame in my cinema again, I won’t turn you into the
Nazi’s I’ll kill you myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a
curfew pass. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Out, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Out, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>madame mimieux</strong>: You damn well better.</p>
<p><strong>back to roof</strong>: Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Are you well?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette
without hearing Madames voice yelling at me. That’s why I do it. To hear
Madames voice again.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: We both miss her.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be to bed
soon. Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.</p>
<p><strong>int - french bistro - afternoon</strong>: Shosanna sits in
the back of a French bistro, reading a book, “The Saint in New York” by
Leslie Charteris, drinking wine. When the young German Private from the
other day, FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over to her. “Oh
no, not this guy again”, she thinks. Again they speak in FRENCH
SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: May I join you?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Look Fredrick -</p>
<p>****: - You remember my name?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Yes….Look, you seem a pleasant enough
fellow -</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: - Merci.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Your welcome. - regardless, I want you to
stop pestering me.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn’t trying
to be a pest. I was simply trying to be friendly.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I don’t wish to be your friend.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Don’t act like a infant. You know why.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I’m more then just a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Not to me. If you are so desperate for a
French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy? Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN
SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a
fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non
German speaking members of the movies audience, can understand. He signs
autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they go on their way.
Shosanna’s eyes narrow.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I thought I was just a uniform?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Your not just a German soldier, are you
somebodies son?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Most German soldiers are somebodies
son.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Yeah, but your not just somebody. What are
you, Hitlers nephew? He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and
he says;</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: No not really, I’m just teasing you. She
leans back annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Then what is it? What are you, a German
movie star?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: , what does that mean, “not exactly”. I
asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or
no. Fredrick laughs at that line.</p>
<p><strong>fredricr</strong>: When you said that just now, you reminded
me of my sister. This catches young Shosanna off guard.</p>
<p><strong>fredricr</strong>: I come from a home of six sisters. We run
a family operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema,
reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our
father wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very much. You’d like her, she
doesn’t wear a German uniform.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: You were raised by Helga?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: All my sisters, I’m the baby, but Helga
was the bossiest.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: And your mother and father?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: My mother died. And my father was a loser.
My fathers moto; “If at first you don’t succeed, quit”. The day he left,
good riddance. My sisters are all I need. It’s why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: is your cinema still operatiing?</p>
<p><strong>fredricr</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: The Kino Haus.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: How has it done durring the war?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is
up.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No doubt, you don’t have to operate under
a curfew.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: How often do you fill your house?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: , not since before the war.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: So if you had one big engagement, that
would help you out?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Of course, but that’s not likely to
happen. TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach the
table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for them. One of
the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting it is to meet a real live
German war hero. Shosanna hears it. They leave. So that’s it, she
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: So your a war hero? Why didn’t you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Everybody knows that, I liked you
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: What did you do? He takes a sip of
beer.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers in world
war two…so far. You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I was alone in a bell tower in a walled
off city in Russia. It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a
bird’s nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: What’s a bird’s nest?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call
a bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty
degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: How many Russian’s did you kill?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Sixty-eight.</p>
<p>****: The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two,
the third day. On the forth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war
story received alot of attention in Germany, that’s why they all
recognize me. They call me the German Sgt.York.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Maybe they’ll make a film about your
exploits.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels
thought. So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride”, and guess what, they
wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks
all over Paris. That’s another reason for all the attention.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: “Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s
Pride” is starring you?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I know, comical, huh?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Not so comical. So what are you doing in
Paris, enjoying a rest?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having
my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that
sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so I’ve been
helping them in the planning. Joseph is very keen on this film. He’s
telling anybody who will listen, when “Nation’s Pride” is released, I’ll
be the German Van Johnson. Shosanna, wasn’t falling for the young
German, by any stretch. However his exploits, as well as his charming
manner, can’t help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as
“Joseph”, like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
of things. This young man is trouble with a capital “T”, and she needs
to stay far fucking away from him. She abruptly rises, and says;</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Well, good luck with your premier Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself. Au revoir. And with that,
she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private alone.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cinema marquee - day</strong>: It’s the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee. Marcel
excuses himself to visit the toilet. $hosanna is alone outside the
little cinema, perched up on her ladder.</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the
little cinema. A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of
the back of the sedan. The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder; Both GERMAN and FRENCH
will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Mademoiselle Nimieux?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui? Telling his Driver in German to ask
her in French;</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Ask her if this is her cinema? in
French The Driver asks Shosanna;</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: is this your cinema?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Tell her to come down.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Come down please. She climbs down the
ladder. The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
to get in.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I don’t understand, what have I done?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: She wants to know what she’s done?</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Who says she’s done anything?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Who says you’ve done anything? Then in her
best imitation of Madame Mimeux’s arrogantmanner.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Then I demand to know what this is about,
and where do you propose to take me? The Driver begins to translate,
when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The
Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German;</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Get your ass in that car. No
translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by
the Germans. The sedan takes off.</p>
<p><strong>int - sedan - day</strong>: The Nazi sedan drives through the
early afternoon Paris streets.</p>
<p><strong>we hold shosanna in tight cu</strong>: the whole ride, never
showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face
trying not to revel anything. The sedan stops. The car door opens and
the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.</p>
<p><strong>ext/int- maxium’s - day</strong>: She steps out of the car,
and is lead into a Paris cafe by the Gestapo Officer. It takes the young
Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she’s not being led to a
Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but
to lunch. The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at
it. Germany’s Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in Hitlers
Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator , FRANCESCA
MONDINO, and young Private Zoller, are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH
POODLES, belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another
chair at the table. We join them in mid-conversation; They all speak
GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: - it’s only the off spring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically. America olympic gold can
measured in Negro sweat. Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by
the Gestapo Major. Private Zoller see’s her, and stands up, excuse’s
himself, and greets her before she reaches the table. Fredrick says in
French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Good you came. I wasn’t sure weather or
not you’d except my invitation.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Invitation?</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;</p>
<p><strong>goebbles</strong>: Is that the young lady in question,
Fredrick? Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
there is somebody I want you to meet. Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated,
looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme
brule into his mouth. The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the
propaganda minister formally.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce
you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film
industry, and now I’m a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels offers
up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
Mimieux. He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big
bite of terri misu. They all laugh. Fredrick jumps in…</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: looks up at Shosanna.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Francesca Mondino is much more then
Goebbels French Interpreter. She’s also Goebbels favorite French actress
to appear in his films…</p>
<p><strong>film clip</strong>: from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels
produced productions. Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with
a YOUNG</p>
<p><strong>german soldier.</strong>: She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in
to ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>francesca/peasant girl</strong>: I love you, I can’t help it.
My country or my heart, which do I betray? A SUBTITLE APPEARS below
naming the films title;</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her
boudoir, on her red velvet bed.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And Goebbels favorite French Mistress, to
act in his bed. WE SEE JUST A SUPER QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING
Francesca</p>
<p>****: Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!</p>
<p><strong>back to francesca</strong>: looking at Shosanna.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Bon jour.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Bon jour.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: f.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: And you’ve met the Major. The Gestapo
officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;</p>
<p><strong>gestapo major</strong>: Actually, I didn’t introduce myself.
Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle.
Please allow me, have a seat. The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for
the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her
right is Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered poodles.
Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small craft on
the table.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Try the wine mademoiselle, it’s
quite good. Goebbels looks across the table at her.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: well I must say, you’ve made quite a
impression on our boy. Francesca interprets Goebbels German for
Shosanna.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I must say fraulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you. Francesca interprets..</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I arrive in France, and I wish to have
lunch with my star… Francesca interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Little do I know Be’s become the toast of
paris, and now he must find time for me. Francesca interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: People wait in line hours, day’s, to see
me. For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait. Francesca interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: So finally, I’m granted a audience with
the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and
your cinema. Francesca interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: So Fraulein Mimieux, let’s get down to
business. Private Zoller interrupts -</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: - Heer Goebbels, I haven’t informed her
yet.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Unless the girls a simpleton, I’m sure
she’s figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her. Francesca tells Shosanna in French;</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What they’re trying to tell you
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying
to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private
Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema. Zoller
reacts.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I wanted to inform her.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Shit. I apologize Private, of course you
did.</p>
<p>****: What’s the issue?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: The Private wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he
has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a
venue change.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Duly noted. Goebbels speaks German
to Shosanna;</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: You have opera boxes?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: More would be better. How many seats in
your auditorium?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Three hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: That’s almost four hundred less then The
Ritz. Fredrick jumps in…</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: But beer Goebbels, that’s not such a
terrible thing. You said yourself you didn’t want to indulge every two
faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seat’s
it makes the event more exclusive. Your not trying to fill the house,
their fightin g for seats.</p>
<p>****: Besides, to hell with the French. This is a German night, a
German event, a German celebration. This night is for you, me, the
German military, the high command, their family and friends. The only
people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved
by the exploits on screen. Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit
of a pause;</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I’ve created a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When
the war’s over, politics awaits. Table chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Well Private, though it is true, I’m
inclined to indulge you anything. I must watch a film in this young
ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no. So young lady, you are to
close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me. Francesca
interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: What German films do you have? Francesca
asks..</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: My cinema , on German night, tends to show
older German classics. Francesca interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Why not my films? Francesca asks…</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I draw a older German audience in my
cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time. Francesca
interprets…</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: That’s nonsense fraulein. Us Germans are
looking forward, not backwards. That era of German cinema is dead. The
German cinema I create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe. But the
worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood.
Fredrick Jumps in…</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Along with being a cinema owner,
Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic. He chuckles, but
alone.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: WSo it would appear. Unfortunately for the
fraulein, I’ve outlawed film criticism. Zoller, thinking fast, says;</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”? I’m
sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen. it. And it’s so funny, I’ve been meaning to
recommend it to her, for her German night. That’s a great idea, let’s
watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Ahhh, “Lucky Kids”, “Lucky Kids”, “Lucky
Kids”. When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production.
Not only that, I wouldn’t be surprised, if sixty years from now, It’s
“Lucky Kids” that I’m the most remembered for. I know it doesn’t seem
like it now, but mark my words. Very well, I’ll have a print sent over
to the fraulein’.s cinema. We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Ah Landa, your here, this is the young
lady in question. The S.S. Officer sits down, and it’s our old friend
from the first scene COL HANS LANDA.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of the SS.,
he’ll be running security for the premier.</p>
<p><strong>cu shosanna</strong>: A bomb is dropped and detonated behind
her eyes. But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends
here. The S.S. OFFICER that murdered her family, takes her hand and
kisses it, saying in perfect French;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Charmed Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Better known as “The Jew Hunter”.
The table laughs.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Oh Francesca, what was that funny thing
the Fuhrer said about Hans?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: You know, you were there, it was a funny
thing the Fuhrer said, about Hans…Something about a pig? Francesca’s
memory is jogged.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, yes of course. She repeats it by
whispering it in Goebbels ear.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Oh, yes of course, that’s it. So the
Fuhrer said, he wouldn’t be surprised if Hans weren’t rooting out Jews
like a truffle pig from the play pen.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: That’s what we need, pigs that can root
out Jews.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Who needs pigs when you have me? Big
hearty laugh around the table.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Do you have a engagement tonight?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Well, as a matter of fact, I do -</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: - Break it. We’re all going to the
Fraulein’s cinema tonight to view “Lucky Kids”.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Splendid. Then Reich Ministers companion
mademoiselle Mondino,</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: And now I must get Reich Minister
Goebbels to his next appointment.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Slave driver! French slave driver! They
all chuckle. Everybody begins to stand up from the table… ..Francesca
gathers the stupid dogs… .as Col Landa stands, he says;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Actually, in my role as security chief of
this joyous German occasion, I’m afraid I must have a word with
Mademoiselle Mimieux.</p>
<p><strong>c. 5.</strong>: Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private
Zoller, who responds.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: What sort of discussion?</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: That sounded suspiciously like a Private
questioning the order of a Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Nothing could be further from the truth
Colonel. Your authority is beyond question. But your reputation does
proceed you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s simply
smitten. And he’s correct. Your reputation does proceed you. Laughter
all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage, make their way to
front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on a leash, leading the
way.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: No need for concern, you two. As security
chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue’s
property owner.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle
Mimieux back to her cinema.</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Nonsense! You can eat ice cream, and walk
along the Sienne another time. Right now, allow Col Landa to do his job.
Everybody saystheir farewells. Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding
a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxims. The fluency
and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters french, revels to the
audience, that his feigning clumsiness at french with Monsieur Lapadite
in the films first scene, was simply a interrogation-technique.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Have you tried the strudel here?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: It’s not so terrible. So how is it the
young Private and yourself came to be acquainted? She’s about to answer,
when a WAITER approaches.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and
one for the mademoiselle. A cup of espresso, with a container of.
steamed milk, on the side. For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was
on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his
ordering her milk is, to say the least… . disconcerting. The key to Col
Landa’s power, and or charm, depending on the side ones on, lies in his
ability to convince you he’s privy to your secrets.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to
explain….?</p>
<p>****: Up untill a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private
Zoller, or his exploits. To me, the Private was simply just a patron of
my cinema. We spoke a few times, but -</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious. The
Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I apologize, I forgot to order the cream
fresh.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: One moment. He exits.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Wait for the cream.</p>
<p>****: So Emmanuelle - May I call you Emmanuelle?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it
happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema? The
Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels. The S.S.
Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking up his fork, he
says;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: After you. Shosanna takes â€¢a whip
creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her lead.</p>
<p>****: Success? Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she
approves.</p>
<p><strong>.col landa</strong>: Like I said, not so terrible.</p>
<p>****: So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: The cinema originally belonged to my aunt
and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: - What is there names?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux. He records
the names in his little book.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Pity… . Continue.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Aunt Ada passed away from fever last
spring.’</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Regrettable.</p>
<p>****: It’s come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is
that true?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He’s the
only other one who works with me.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Projectionist.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Is he any good?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: The best.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Actually one could see where that might
be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Of course I can.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I’m
quite positive he wouldn’t want the success or failure of his
illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro. So if it comes
to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your
negro may be, you will operate the projectors. Is that exceptable? As if
she has any say.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui. Col Landa takes another bite of
strudel, Shosanna follows suit.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: So it would appear our young hero is
quite smitten with you?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Private Zollers feelings for me aren’t of
a romantic nature.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Mademoiselle…?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I
remind him of his sister.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: That doesn’t mean his feelings aren’t
romantic.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I remind him of his sister who raised
him.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: It’s sounding more and more romantic by
the minute. Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a
S.S. LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Do you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Then I insist, you must take one. There
not French, there German. I hope your not nationalist about your
tobacco, to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine. She takes
one, but makes no move to light it. He inhales deep, and says;</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: I did have some thing else I wanted to
ask you, but right now, for the life of me, I can’t remember what it is.
Oh well, must not of been important. Col Landa stands up, throws some
French francs on the table, puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his
finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and saying:</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: Till tonight. And with that he’s gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief. The CAMERA begins to slowly lower
from a MEDIUM CU to her feet ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a
puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man that
exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself. She drops the
German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her feet.</p>
<p><strong>int - cinema auditorium - night</strong>: The SILVER SCREEN
on screen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS”. We hear OFF
SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.</p>
<p><strong>cu goebbels</strong>: Watching the screen, basking in his own
toxic genius.</p>
<p><strong>cu francesca</strong>: Laughing at the comedy, hand covering
her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>cu two black poodles</strong>: Pantingly watching the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>cu major hellstrom</strong>: Smiling, smoking a French
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>cu col landa</strong>: Smoking his calabash, amused.</p>
<p><strong>cu fredrick zoller</strong>: Truly enjoying himself.</p>
<p><strong>cu shosanna</strong>: watching the screen. The LITERARY
NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: While Shosanna sits there pretending to be
amused by the aryan antics of Goebbels Frank Capra copy, “Lucky Kids”, a
thought suddenly comes to her. We see her face get slightly distracted
behind the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: What if tonight, accidently, the cinema
burned down? The Third Reich would lose it’s Minister of propaganda,
it’s national hero, and it’s top jew hunter, all in one fell swoop. She
chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she’s laughing at the
German comedy.</p>
<p><strong>silver screen</strong>: “The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is
projected. The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.</p>
<p><strong>iz</strong>: The lights go up.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand
and begin to file out into the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a
complete success. And Heer Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed
to Shosannas cinema. Not only that, in a moment of inspiration, Heer
Goebbels had a idea. Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca
translates;</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: I must say, I appreciate the modesty of
this auditorium. Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like. Not
to say we couldn’t spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there’s a
crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary.
we’re going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium
roof. Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just
scatter them about the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: we see a quick series of shots that show
all that happening. The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of
Versailles. Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre. A
truck driving through the french countryside with the enormous crystal
chandelier in the back. The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in
Nazi iconography. WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are
moved into place. We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to
hoist the huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s
Italian B-movie rip off’s of Visconti’s “The Damned”.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: watches all this from a opera box, she
shakes her head in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>back to shosanna and the nazi “s</strong>: in the lobby, post
screening of “Lucky Rids”, she’s soundlessly escorting them to the door,
as they make their goodbyes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As they left the little French cinema that
night, all the Germans were very happy… We see Private Zoller hanging
back, so he.can say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: None more so then Private Zoller. She
closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi’s walk into the Paris night.
Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look like grotesque Nazi
charcthers. 4644 The Nazi’s are gone. Marcel sits at the top of the
staircase of the lobby, looking down at Shosanna. They speak in FRENCH
SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: What the fuck are we suppose to do?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: It looks like we’re suppose to have a Nazi
premier.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Like I said, what the fuck are we suppose to
do?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Well, I need to speak with you about
that.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: About these Hun swine, commandeering our
cinema.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: What about it? She slowly walks up the
stairs to Marcel. She makes him part his legs, and sits on the lower
step, between his legs. Her back up against his chest, his arms around
her shoulders. Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with
Marcel.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Well, when I was watching the bosch</p>
<p>****: Capra-corn abomination,</p>
<p>****: I got a idea.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m confused, what are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Filling the cinema with Nazi’s and their
whores, and burning it down to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: I’m not talking about that, your talking
about that.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No, we’re talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it
down by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Shosanna -</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if
we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I
could physically accomplish that, no?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui Shosanna, we could do that.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: And with Madame Mimieux’s 350 nitrate film
print collection, we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: You mean we wouldn’t need any more
explosives?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Oui, that’s exactly what I mean. She
begins kissing his hands.</p>
<p>****: I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night. One of his
fingers probes her mouth.</p>
<p>****: And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both
know, your not going to let me do it by myself. The back of her head
presses up hard against him, as his hand both caresses, and grips her
lovely neck.</p>
<p>****: Because you love me. And I love you. And your the only person
on this earth I can trust. She then TWISTS around, so she’s straddling
him. They are now, face to face.</p>
<p>****: But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the filmmaking
equipment it the attic still work? I know the film camera does. How
about the sound recorder?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Quite well, actually. I recorded a new
guitarist I met in a cafe last week. It works superb. Why do we need
filmmaking equipment?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re going to
make a film. Just for the Nazi’s.</p>
<p><strong>int - english country estate - day</strong>: A young MILITARY
ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors that serve as a entrance to the
room.</p>
<p><strong>military attache</strong>: Right this way, Lieutenant. A
snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside the
room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with the Gerrys since the
late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX. A young George Sanders type .
Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked. Standing before him is
legendary military mastermind, GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders
type . But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his
ever present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.</p>
<p><strong>lt. hicox</strong>: Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.</p>
<p><strong>gen fenech</strong>: General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox. Drink?
Hicox’s eye’s go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who’s
scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind the cigar
makes no gesture, and the General, makes no acknowledgment of the three
hundred pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean,
if Churchell isn’t introduced, he ain’t there.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: if you offered me a scotch and plane
water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself, like a good chap, will you? Bars in the globe. Hicox heads
over to the bar globe.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Something for yourself, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Whiskey straight. No junk in it. The
Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and busies
himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy. Fenech, eyeing the
Lieutenant’s file.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: It says here you’ve run three undercover
commando operations in Germany, and German occupied territories?
Frankfaurt, Holland, and Norway to be exact? Back to them, mixing
drinks, he says;</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Extraordinary people, the Norwegian’s.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: It says here you speak German
fluently?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Like a Katzenjammer Kid.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: And your occupation before the war? His
back still to us, as he bartends…</p>
<p><strong>lt. h i cox</strong>: I’m a film critic.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: List your accomplishments?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Well sir, such as they are, I write
reviews and articles, for a publication called; “Films and Filmmakers”.
As well as our sister publication.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: What’s that called?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: “Flickers Bi-Monthly”. And I’ve had two
books published.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Impressive. Don’t be modest Lieutenant,
what are their titles?</p>
<p><strong>lt. hi cox</strong>: The first book was called; “Art Of The
Eye’s, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study of German Cinema in the
Twenties”. And the second one was called; … He turns around with his
whiskey and plain water, and the Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes
what he was saying, as he walks toward the General, handing him his
drink.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: “Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci”. It’s a
subtexual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W.
Pabst.</p>
<p><strong>lt. hi cox</strong>: What should we drink to, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Down with Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: All the way down, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich?</p>
<p><strong>lt. hi cox</strong>: Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of the
films made in the last three years, but I am familiar with it.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Explain it to me.?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Pardon sir?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: This little escapade of ours, requires a
knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to
me UFA, under Goebbels?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Goebbels considers the films he’s making
to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema. A alternative to what
he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties. And
the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood. SUDDENLY… Bellowing from the
back of the room;</p>
<p><strong>churchell</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>lt. h i cox</strong>: Frightfully sorry sir, once again?</p>
<p><strong>churchell</strong>: You say he wants to take on the Jews at
their own game? Compared to say .Louis B.Mayer…how’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels has
taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last
eight years. But Louis B.Mayer wouldn’t be Goebbels proper opposite
number. I believe Goebbels see’s himself closer to David O.Selznick.
Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister. With a puff of cigar smoke,
Churchell says;</p>
<p><strong>churchell</strong>: Brief him.</p>
<p><strong>gem.fenech</strong>: Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I’d like
to brief you on, Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in Paris -</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: - What film sir? The General has to resort
to peeking at his file.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: The motion pictures called; “Nation’s
Pride”.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Oh, you mean the film about Private
Zoller?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: We don’t have any intelligence, on
exactly, what the film that night will be about.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I can tell you what it’s about, it’s about
Private Fredrick Zoller. He’s the German Sgt.York. Fenech can’t help
suppress a smile, they have the right man.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: In attendance at this joyous Germatic
occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring, Boorman, and most of the German
High command, including all high ranking officers of both The S.S., and,
The Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film
industry.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: The master race at play, aye?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Basically, we have all our rotten eggs
in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino…. Blow up the basket.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: “…and like the snows of yesteryear, gone
from this earth”. Jolly good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: An American Secret Service outfit, that
lives deep behind enemy lines, will be your assist. The Germans call
them; “The Basterds”.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: “The Basterds”, never heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Whole point of the secret service, old
boy, you not hearing of them. But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these yanks have been them the devil. Their leader is a chap named
Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans call him, “Aldo the Apache”.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Why do they call him that?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Best guess, is because he removes the
scalps of the Nazi dead.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Scalps, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: The hair. He runs his finger along his
hairline.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: Like a red Injun.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky
bird, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
nutters. But you’ve heard the expression, “It takes a thief”.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Indeed. General Fenech continues on with
his exposition, moving over to a military map.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: You’ll be dropped into France, about
twenty four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting
for you. First thing, you go to a little village called, “Nadine”.
Apparently the Gerrys never go there. In Nadine, there’s a tavern,
called, “La Louisiane”, you’ll rendez-vous with our double agent, and
she’ll take it from there. She’s the one who’s going to get you in the
premiere. It will be you, her, and two German born members of the
Basterds. She’s also made all the other arrangements your going to
need.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: How will I know her?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: I suspect that won’t be too much trouble
for you. Your contact is Bridget Von Hammersmark.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German movie
star is working for England?</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: For the last two years now. one could
even say Operation Kino was her brainchild. In the back of the room the
bulldog barks;</p>
<p><strong>churchell</strong>: Extraordinary women.</p>
<p><strong>lt.bicox</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>gen.fenech</strong>: You’ll go to the premiere as her escort,
lucky devil. She’ll also have the premiere tickets for the other two.
Got the gist?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cinema rooftop - day</strong>: Shosanna and Marcel are
on the rooftop of their cinema, literally, making a movie. Marcel is
behind a old BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, positioned low looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it. A
old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame. As they always do, and
always will, they speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into you know what.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: We need a sync mark.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: What is a sync mark?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: A action and noise put together, So we can
sync up the picture and sound.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Clap your hands. She does.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: In frame imbecile. She claps her hands in
front of her face.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Ready? Shosanna takes a deep breath,
then;</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Action.</p>
<p><strong>lobby, on the stairs, talking about burning down the
cinema.</strong>: Big diffrence this time, it’s in COLOR.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: But how do we get it developed? Only a
suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get a35mm
print with a soundtrack?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Do you know one person who can do both
things?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Of course Gaspar, very nice man, took care
of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their right mind would
strike a print of what your talking about. If the Nazi’s found out,
their life wouldn’t be worth this. He snaps his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf,
or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to obliterate the Nazi’s, we have
to use their tactics.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: We find somebody who can develop and
process a35mm print. And we make them do it, or we kill them. Once we
tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them
anyway, or they’ll turn us in.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Like that. Snaps her fingers.</p>
<p><strong>int - small film processing lab- late night</strong>: A old
mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties. Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in
the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING at the hands of
his friend Marcel. Shosanna watches, pitiless.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Bring that fucker over here! Put his head
down on that table. Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his
head flat against the table top. Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP
into the table, just by his face.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: You ether do what the fuck we tell you to,
or I’ll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.</p>
<p><strong>gaspar</strong>: I’m not a collaborator!</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Then prove it! Or does your manhood go no
deeper, then standing to piss? Marcel, does his wife, and children know
you?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Then after we kill this dog for Germans,
we’ll go and silence them. She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high…</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!</p>
<p><strong>gaspar</strong>: hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm
FILM. Outside the shop window, it’s morning.</p>
<p><strong>int - projection booth-</strong>: WE SEE the five heavy
silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers life story “Nations Pride” on the
floor of the projection booth. The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
Shosanna’s at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the rewinds… Shosanna
SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of Fredricks film. Rewinds
it, puts it back in the can, and puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her, PLUNGING
THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.</p>
<p><strong>ext - la louisiane - night</strong>: We see a small basement
tavern, with a old rustic sign out front that reads, “La Louisiane”.</p>
<p><strong>a subtitle appears:</strong>: “The Village of</p>
<p><strong>nadine, france”</strong>: TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German
grey S.S. Cap’t uniform. They look out of a window, in a apartment, in
the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: You didn’t say the goddamn rendez-vous was
in a fuckin basement.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: You said it was in a tavern?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: it is a tavern.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin in a
basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting
in a basement. Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
Lieutenant uniform.</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: What if we go in there, and she’s not even
there?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: We wait. Don’t worry, she’s a British spy,
she’ll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in
French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz,
Hirschberg, and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the
grey uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his boot.
Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead.
Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room,
SHARPENS his dagger menacingly. .Stiglitz is fucking werid… Lt.Hicox
approaches Stiglitz…</p>
<p><strong>lt.nicox</strong>: Stiglitz, right?</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: That’s right, sir. He continues bringing
the blades edge, up, then, down on the leather strap.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I hear your pretty good with that? Meaning
the blade. Stiglitz doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: You know, we’re not looking for trouble,
right now. We’re simply making contact with our agent. Should be
uneventful. However, on the off chance I’m wrong, and things prove
eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: I don’t look calm to you?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Well, now you put it like that, I guess
you do. He turns his attention back to his blade. Hicox moves over to
Aldo, and asks him privately;</p>
<p><strong>lt. hi cox</strong>: This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not
exactly the loquacious type, is he? Aldo just looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Is that the kinds man you need, the
loquacious type?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Fair point, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: So y’all git in trouble in there, what are
we suppose to do? Make bets on how it all comes out?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or
French, for matter, escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark’s
cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
who’s idea was it for the death trap redez-vous?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: She chose the spot.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Well isn’t that just dandy?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Look, she’s not a military strategist.
She’s just a actress.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Ya don’t got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don’t want to fight in a basement.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: She wasn’t picking a place to fight. She
was picking a place, isolated, and without germans.</p>
<p><strong>pfc.hirschberg</strong>: Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o’clock. They move to the
window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE, relieves himself against
the side wall. Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Shit. Sgt.Donowitz chides him;</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: So what do you think your fraulein Von
Hammer -</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: - Obviously, I don’t know,Sgt. The British
officer watches the German soldier, who’s not suppose to be there. When
Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window. Stiglitz looks down at the
urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: If we’re going, let’s go. He sheaths the
dagger.</p>
<p><strong>ext - la louisiane - night</strong>: The GERMAN PISSING
PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task. Craming his noodle back in his
pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement
tavern. We Follow him…</p>
<p><strong>int - la louisiane - night</strong>: .Inside the basement
tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low hanging basement ceiling. A old
looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the
little tavern, is taken up by two large tables, which take up both
half’s of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two
tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating Nazi enlisted men,
of which our urinating friend is one of five.</p>
<p><strong>five nazi’s</strong>: ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE
GERMAN SGT , and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES. The Five Nazi’s are sitting
around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other
then the fraulein of the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK.
Dressed to the nines in a chic Forties style women’s suit, complete with
fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having a card
with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their
forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is on their forehead. So
they ask the others questions to figure out who they are. The Five
Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1,</p>
<p><strong>german private #4 , german private #5</strong>: . And Bridget
Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in the brim of her fedora, has
GENGHIS KHAN. It’s German#5 turn to ask questions. The DIALOGUE will be
in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH. Also, while some dialogue will be
written for the German Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the
exuberance of their game playing, and celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: .okay, I’m not German. Am I American? The
whole table bursts out laughing.</p>
<p><strong>female sgt/beethoven</strong>: Yes you arel</p>
<p><strong>edgar wallace</strong>: Well, not really.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.</p>
<p><strong>edgar wallace</strong>: Well if he’s so American, how come
he’s never been translated into English? He’s not American. He’s suppose
to be American, but he’s not a American creation. In fact, he’s
something very different.</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character,
from the past, I’m American, and that’s controversial.</p>
<p><strong>bridget/gengus</strong>: No it’s not controversial. The
nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the
character. The Character is the character. Hamlet’s not British, he’s
Danish. So yes, this character was born in America.</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: Well I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a
wife, would she be called a squaw? He’s got it. The table Laughs. The
TABLE</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand? The
TABLE Yes!</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: Did Karl May write me? The TABLE Yes! In
the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German Officers, Hicox,
Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement tavern. They obviously. see the
five German soldiers, but their too far away for us to read their face.
No doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark see’s them as
well. Without getting up, she waves to them.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Hello, my lovelies, I will join you in
moments. I’m finishing up a game with my five new friends here.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark. Take your
time, enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: So who are you?</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES! The
table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes the card off his
forehead. The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer . Bridget
Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.</p>
<p><strong>mata hari</strong>: Frau Von Hammersmark, when your friends
came in, did you realize you did a double take, like in the movies?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that at
all.</p>
<p><strong>mata hari</strong>: They must be second nature to you now?
Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Well, yes they did, but it’s not really
that difficult.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Do one for us. The Tableheartily
agrees. Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, Double Take. The Table loves it.</p>
<p><strong>mata hari</strong>: My turn, I want to try. Mata Hari, looks
directly at Beethoven, and does a Double Take.</p>
<p><strong>edger wallace</strong>: I want to try. He does. Soon the
whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.</p>
<p><strong>hicox - wicki - stiglitz</strong>: watch the table do dueling
Double Takes. Obviously, they don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses
herself from the Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora,
looking at the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the Gentlemen
rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss, as if she knows
them well. They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed Frenchman named
EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget’s
Champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the
YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I thought this place was suppose to have
more French then Germans?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Normally that’s true. The Sgt over there’s
wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates
the night off to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>wicxi</strong>: We should leave.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: F No, we should stay. For one drink at
least. I’ve been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we
left before we had a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: She’s right, just be calm, and enjoy your
booze.</p>
<p><strong>back to the german table</strong>: The French Barmaid, has
taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them, her
person must be French, or she won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a
moment, then writes a name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her
forehead, It says;</p>
<p><strong>napoleon.</strong>: The Germans all laugh.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: There’s been some new developments. The
cinema venue has changed.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t
be a problem. The cinema it’s been changed to is considerably smaller
then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be
doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal,
try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo
Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.</p>
<p><strong>back to the real germans</strong>: They see Hugo do the spit
take, and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling
spit takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say,
they all get wet.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll
say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl’s “Tiefland”. It’s the one
German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn’t be
caught dead at a Goebbels film affair.</p>
<p><strong>back to real german table</strong>: Master Sgt.Pola Negri,
drinks his beer, as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark
at the other table.</p>
<p><strong>back to basterds</strong>: We See in Bridget continues to
brief Hicox on his identity. the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up
from his table, and head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: .the films gone through many delays, and
Leni’s heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak… Hicox, seeing
the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I’d love to Wilhelm. This handsome happy
Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer
congratulations to the Sgt. The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and
bows before his superior officers.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Thank you, heil Hitler. He raises
his hand …. as do the seated phony officers; “Heil Hitler”. As she takes
a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this
progeny yet?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: I most certainly do, fraulein. His
name is Maximilian. Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this
German Sgt.</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: Wonderful name, Sgt.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old
enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side “The Blue Max”. He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers
to cheers. They do. Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big
flourish.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: There you go. But wait, I’m not finished
yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick. Applies
some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a
big red lip print. Then hands the treasured item to the young
father.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Nothing but the best for little
Maximilian.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max
may not know who you are now. But he will. I will show him all of your
movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern…</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: I purpose a toast to the greatest
actress in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only
Von Hammersmark! The whole room toasts. This would be a good time for
the German Sgt to go back to his table, and his men. And he almost
does…. but… since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what
brings you to France?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: None of your business,Sgt. You might not
have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish
behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game
playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the
fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks
quizzically at the officer.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Excuse me Cap’t, but your accent is
is very unusual. The whole room pauses-for different reasons…</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: Where are you from? A silent moment
passes between the two tables, then the two German born impostors spring
into action.</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad, to
speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness! Stiglitz, STANDS
and YELLS to the other table;</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: I’m making YOU,…</p>
<p>****: .and YOU,.. .responsible, for him. I suggest you take hold of
your friend, or he’ll spend Max’s first birthday in jail for public
drunkenness!</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: A GERMAN VOICE rings out;</p>
<p><strong>german voice</strong>: Then might I inquire? The Five known
Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German in the room, unseen till
now, our old friend from before MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO.
The Major stands from the little table he was sitting at.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Like the young newly christened
father, I too have a acute ear for accents. And like him, I too find
yours odd. From where do you hail, Cap’t? Wicki jumps in;</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: Major, this is highly inappr -</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: T wasn’t speaking to you
Lt.Saltzberg,</p>
<p>****: or you ether, Lt.Berlin.</p>
<p>****: I was speaking to Cap’t I–don’t-know-what. The Gestapo Major is
now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the impostors table. Lt.Hicox,
calmly explains his origin.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I was born in the village that rests in
the shadow of Piz Palu.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: The mountain?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Yes. In that village we all speak like
this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt. hicox</strong>: Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
torch scene?</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: In that scene was myself, my father, my
sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director
Pabst, gave him a Close Up. As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a
cigarette in a ivory cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights
for her, she says;</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Major, if my word means anything, I can
vouch for everything the Young Cap’t has just said. He does hail from
the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more
handsome then he. The impostors laugh. Then….so does the Gestapo Major.
He turns to the Sgt.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table begins playing
there game again. Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the
room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: May I join you?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: By all means, Major. The Gestapo Major sits
at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and Wicki. The French Barmaid brings
over the Majors beer stein.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: So that’s the source of your bazaar
accent? Extraordinary. So what are you doing here Cap’t?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fraulein?</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Well that pleasure requires no
explanation. Chuckle…Chuckle</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: I mean in country. Your obviously
not stationed in France, or I’d know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>lt â€¢ i’! i cox</strong>: You know every German in
France?</p>
<p><strong>major bellstrom</strong>: Worth knowing.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Well, there in lies the problem. We never
claimed to be worth knowing. Chuckle… Chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: All levity aside, what are you
doing in France?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Attending Goebbels film premiere as the
frauleins escort.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Your the frauleins escort?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Somebody has to carry the lighter. Chuckle
chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: The Captain is my date, but all three are
my guests. We’re old friends Major, who go back along time. Longer then
a actress would care to admit. Chuckle chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Well, in that case, let me raise a
glass to the three luckiest men in the room.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>back to the real german table</strong>: They continue to have
alot of fun playing their game.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: I must say, that game their playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t join them, because your quite
right Cap’t, officers and enlisted men shouldn’t fraternize. But seeing
as we’re all officers here,</p>
<p>****: .and sophisticated lady friends of officers. What say we play
the game? Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget , interrupts him;</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: okay, one game.</p>
<p><strong>wunderbar</strong>: The Major borrows five cards from the
other table, and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: So the object of the game, is to
write the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious,
doesn’t matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu
Manchu.</p>
<p>****: Eric’ More pens. And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga’s. When
you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to
the person to your left. The person to your right, will move their card
in front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the
back, and stick it on your forehead like so. He demonstrates.</p>
<p>****: And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are… As
Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, The
CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The Majors
dialogue begins to FADE AWAY. Untill we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN
FLASHBACK. Which is RED FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED
by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
The Flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close
to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into it. The Majors Voice
comes back on the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: .So let’s give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names. The Five players write their names… Then
move their cards to the right… Everybody sticks their cards on their
forehead…</p>
<p><strong>hellstromvon hammersmarkwickihicoxstiglitz</strong>: is is is
is is</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: I’ll start, give you the idea. Am I
German? They laugh.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Am I a American? They laugh - but
then Wicki says;</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: Wait a minute, he goes to</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, obviously he wasn’t
born in America.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: So… . I visited America, aye? The
Table says; “Yes”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Was this vist…fortuitous?</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: Not for you.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: .Bummm. My native land, is it what
one would call, exotic? The Table confers, and decides, yes it is
exotic.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Hummmm. That could be ether a
reference to the jungle, or the Orient. I’m going to let my first
instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle? The Tablesays; “Yes
you are”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Now gentlemen, around this time you
could ask, weather your real or fictitious. I however, think that’s too
easy, so I won’t ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle? I
visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle
to America,… .Did I go by boat? “Yes”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Did I go against my will? “Yes”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: On this boat ride, … . Was I in
chains?</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: When I arrived in America,…Was I
displayed in chains? “Yes”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Am I the story of the Negro in
America? The Table says, “No”.</p>
<p><strong>maj.king kong</strong>: Well then I must be King Kong. Be
throws the card on the table. They applaud him.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Nov since I answered correctly, you
all need to finnish your drinks. The three counterfeit Nazi’s knock back
their whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Now, who’s next?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the
four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven’t seen each
other in quite a while. So… Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: I beg to differ Cap’t. It’s only if
the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a
intruder. How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Of course not, Major.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: I didn’t think so. It’s simply the
young Cap’t is immune to my charms. The Table’s not sure what to do, is
this a confrontation? Then, the Major laughs.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: I’m just joking, of course I’m
intruding.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Allow me to refill your glasses
gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu. Eric has a bottle
of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish
highlands. What do you say gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Your most gracious, sir.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Eric, the thirty-three, and new
glasses! You don’t want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill
you were drinking.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How many glasses?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Five glasses.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Not me. I like scotch, scotch
doesn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly. Lt.Bicox,
hold up three fingers, to Eric the owner.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Three glasses. Eric brings the three
glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers. Major
Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: To a thousand year Reich! They all
mutter, “a thousand year reich”, and toast glasses. The Gestapo Major
puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK, under the table.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Did you hear that? That’s the sound
of my Luger pointed right at your testicles.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Because you’ve just given yourself
away, Cap’t. Your no more German then that scotch.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Well, -Major -</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: - Major -</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: - Shut up slut. You were
saying?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve
had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.stiglitz</strong>: That makes three of us.</p>
<p><strong>undertable</strong>: We See all three guns pointed at
appropriate crotches. As well as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi
Major’s. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible
crossfire.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.stiglitz</strong>: And at this range, I’m a real Fredrick
Zoller. Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table
top.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Hummmmm … Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. h icox</strong>: What’s going to happen, Major, is your
going to stand up, and walk out that door with us.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: No no no no no no, I don’t think
so. I’m afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody
else in this room, the two of us aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Too bad about them though. They
seem like a likeable You two will have to shoot them.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Then Major, i implore you. For the sake of
those German troops, will you please leave with us?</p>
<p><strong>major hellstrom</strong>: Oh Bridget, your concern for German
troops, gets me .right here. You mean for the sake your whore legs,
don’t you? You can’t afford to get any bullet holes in them, your not
finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews. Lt.Hicox picks up
his thirty-three year old single malt scotch, and says;</p>
<p>****: ’Well, if this is it old boy, I hope you dont mind if I go out
speaking the kings?</p>
<p>****: By all means, Cap’t. The English film critic, commando, picks
up the thirty-three the Nazi Major bought him, and says;</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: There’s a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good scotch. And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily… He downs the stuff.</p>
<p>****: I must say, damn good stuff, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Now about this, “Pickle”, we find
ourself’s in. It would appear, there’s only thing left for you to
do.</p>
<p>****: And what would that be?</p>
<p><strong>lt.hicox</strong>: Stiglitz.</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls!</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS… As does
HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well.</p>
<p><strong>hellstrom</strong>: FIRES into HICOX’S BALLS and KNEE
CAPS.</p>
<p><strong>stiglitz</strong>: then JUMPS over the table, and begins
STABBING HELLSTROM with the</p>
<p><strong>dagger.</strong>: HICOX FALLS to the floor….DEAD. BRIDGET
FALLS to the floor.,SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>wicki</strong>: brings his weapon out from underneath the
table, and BEGINS FIRING across at The GERMANS at the table, who
unaware, were still PLAYING THE GAME.</p>
<p><strong>winnetou</strong>: is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knew
what was happening. EDGAR WALLACE and The FRENCH BARMAID are both SHOT
by WICKI.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT.BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each other and
FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS, it’s almost
romantic when they collapse DEAD on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>i 09.</strong>: WICKI and HATA HARI both ON THERE atMATA AARI
is G</p>
<p><strong>sgt.pola negri</strong>: comes the a CHINE GUNN, whole
thehroom;,BWIPI NGERIC. The SHOOTING STOPS…the SMOKE caused by the
gunfire … starts to DISSIPATE… The only one in the room left alive, is
the young German Sgt, with the machine gunn. WE HEAR the feet of the
soldiers outside, reach the basement entrance. The door opens… , .The
German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors direction… No one goes
through it. What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one
inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in. The young German
Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside;</p>
<p><strong>german sgt</strong>: You outside! Who are you? British,
American, what? Aldo’s Voice YELLS down the hole;</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Were American’s 1 What are you?</p>
<p><strong>german sgt</strong>: I’m a German you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: You speak English pretty good for a
German!</p>
<p><strong>german sgt</strong>: I agree! So let’s talk!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Okay, talk!</p>
<p><strong>german sgt</strong>: I’m a father! My baby was born today in
Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and
celebrating! They’re the ones that came in shooting and killing! It’s
not my fault!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!
What’s your name soldier?</p>
<p><strong>german sgt</strong>: Wilhelm!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: That’s the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: They attacked us!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Okay Wilhelm… .is anybody alive on our
side?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: No! We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell
out;</p>
<p><strong>bridget’s voice</strong>: I’m alive! Wilhelm spins in the
direction of the voice.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG,
lies the alive Bridget Von Hammersmark. The German Sgt points the muzzle
of the machine gunn at the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p>****: Make a sound whore, and I spit! Meaning the muzzle.</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Wilhelm, who is that?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: is the girl on your side? Pause.</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Which girl?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: 1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Yeah, she’s oar’s!</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: I thought so. So you run with the
American’s now, huh? Now times are bad?</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Is she okay?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: You despicable traitor. She’s been shot,
but she’s alive. For now. We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off
Screen.</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Okay Wilhelm, what’d ya say we make a
deal?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap
Willi?</p>
<p><strong>wilhelm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: So Willi, you know we could lob three
or four or five or six grenades down there, and your little war story
ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her, you die, she dies. So what say
we make a swap?</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: Keep talking?</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Okay, Willi here’s my deal! You let me
and one of my men come down to take the girl away! And we take the girl,
and leave! That simple, Willi! You go your way, we go ours! And little
Max, gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what’ya say,
Willi, we got a deal? Willi thinks… Bridget watches Willi think…</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: Aldo?</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: I’m here Willi!</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: I want to trust you…. But howcanI?</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: What choice ya got?</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: I could kill the girl!</p>
<p><strong>aldo’s voice</strong>: Well now, Willi, that’s true enough.
But something you need to know, so you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t
none of us give a fuck bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill her,
it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be dead by then anyway, so what’d
you care? And lets not forget that little gatzenjammer Max, growin up
without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin you home to him, we got a
deal, Willi?</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: Okay Aldo, I’m going to trust you! Come down,
no guns! Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them. Aldo with his hands up,
says;</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Hey Willi, what’s with the machine gunny I
thought we had a deal?</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: We do have a deal, now git the girl and
go.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Not so fast, Willi, we only have a deal, we
trust each other. A Mexican stand off ain’t trust.</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican
stand off.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: you got guns on us, you decide to shoot, we’re
dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop ’em down here, your dead.
That’s a Mexican stand off, and that wasn’t the deal.</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: Just take that fucking traitor, and go! See?
Now your down here Now you get tricky - t</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: - No tricks!- Ain’t nobody gittin tricky,
Willi; I swear to god, I’m too damn dumb toget tricky. But</p>
<p>****: him and I lived upto the deal. We came down without guns. Now
it’s your turn. No trust,no deal. Willi pointing gunn at them.,,,
-thinking…</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: i know your scarred. I’m scarred, he’s
scarred, we’re all scarred. So what’s it gonnabe Willi? Ether we got a
deal, or you might as well just shoot us now. Willi decides… He puts the
machine gunn down on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>willi</strong>: Fine. Take that fucking traitor and get her
out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg, you grab
her shoulder -</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget
lifts up Major Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD. Aldo and Hirscberg spin around
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with that man!
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain , German
movie star, says to the two American soldier’s she’s just meeting for
the first time;</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: He was a enemy soldier, who knew who I was.
He couldn’t live.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: I ought’a beat your fuckin head in</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Stop it. Just pick her up, and get that bitch
outta here.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Aldo, she just-</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: - She’s right.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: I said, she’s right. He was a Nazi soldier. If
he lived, he would doomed the mission.</p>
<p>****: Don’t mean I like it, don’t mean I like her, but she’s right.
Now as Willi said, “take this fuckin traitor, and get ’er outta my
sight”.</p>
<p><strong>ext - la louisiane - night</strong>: Hirschberg, carrying
Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge from the bowels of the
basement. Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it’s
her’s. Aldo, Hirschberg, Bridget, Donowitz, and Utivich pile in, and
take off.</p>
<p><strong>int - french house in country - night</strong>: NOTE:In this
entire scene, no French spoken will be SUBTITLED. A OLD MAN lies asleep
under the covers of his blankets, in his bed, in his bedroom…</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED
OPEN… r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING …. and the
sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARDS US… .his bedroom door, is THROWN OPEN, and
Sgt.Donowitz RUSHES IN, grabbing the Old Man in his bed, and putting a
45Automatic to his head.</p>
<p>****: Doctor? Doctor?</p>
<p>****: What? What’s happening? head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45.
hard against the Old Man’s scarring, and bringing the old gent to
attention.</p>
<p>****: Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor? He nods his head, yes.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Andi amo…</p>
<p><strong>int - doctors examining room - night</strong>: .Into a
doctors examining room, built into a French country house, with a
examining table, and medical instruments. However, it’s obviously the
medical examining room of a veterinarian. Along the walls are different
cages with eight excited BARKING dogs in it. The Soldiers are putting
the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in excruciating pain, Bridget on the
examining table. Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the
girls direction…</p>
<p>****: She’s been shot. Shot. Bang bang… .in leg…understand?</p>
<p>****: No no no, I don’t speak English. Donny jams the barrel of his
45. into the thigh of the Old Man.</p>
<p>****: BANG BANG - in the leg, understand! The Old Man nods his head
yes.</p>
<p>****: But I’m a veterinarian …animals… I take care of animals…
Bridget screams from the table…</p>
<p>****: He’s a fucking veterinarian you imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: It’s still a doctor. If he can get a bullet out
of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Right now, we just need morphine. Donny
yells at the Old Man;</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Morphine! We need morphine! The Old
Man tries to explain in French, that he’s not a human doctor…</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the
DOGS in the cages. Everybody jumps. Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;</p>
<p><strong>bang</strong>: He SHOOTS another dog…</p>
<p><strong>morephine!!!</strong>: The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes
to get the morphine.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The BODY of Gestapo Major DEITER HELLSTROM
dead on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>int - la louistane- night</strong>: Were back in the basement
tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands over the corpse. He moves over to the
next corpse, a smile breaks out on his face. He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED
into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Ahhh Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world I
see. Lieutenant. And with your record of insubordination. Truly
remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: And that ones…</p>
<p>****: .name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets Austrian born jew, who immigrated
to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of The Basterds. They’ve been known
to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a
company of other German Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us.
Dried bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms. The SGT
of the German company, yells to the trio;</p>
<p><strong>sgt.german company</strong>: What brings you all the way out
here? The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.</p>
<p><strong>col landa</strong>: But that doesnt look like this. This is
odd. Looking down he see’s something… .bending down, he examines
fraulein von Hammersmarks two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor. One
shoe is covered in blood. The other, while blood speckled, is fairly
clean. Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: It would appear somebodies missing.
Somebody fashionable. A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out;</p>
<p><strong>soldiers voice</strong>: Col, this ones still alive! We
follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies. He’s shot in
the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>int - examining room -Â° night</strong>: Bridget on the
examining table, post morphine shot. The other Basterds in the room
watch Aldo interrogate the German lady.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you
need to answer a few questions</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Few questions about what?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: About I got three men dead back there, and
why don’t you try tellin us what the fuck happened?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: The British officer blew his German act,
and a Gestapo Major saw it.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: ’fore we get into who shot John, why did
you invite my men to a rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch of
Nazis?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I can see, since you didn’t see what
happened inside, the Nazi’s being there must look odd.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in
English, it’s called, suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>bri dget</strong>: Don’t let your imagination get the better
of you, Lieutenant. You met the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight.
His commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to
celebrate. The Germans being there was just a tragic coincidence. Aldo
thinks for a moment…</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Okay, I’ll buy that. He was ether there
with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his sons
birthday, he wasn’t doin both.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: How did the shootin start?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: The English man, gave himself away.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: How did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: He ordered three glasses. She holds up
three fingers, index to pinky.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: We order, three glasses. She holds up three
fingers, thumb to index.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: That’s the German three. The other is odd.
Germans would, and did notice it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans,
and everything went exactly the way it was suppose to. What would of
been the next step?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Tuxedos. To get them into the premiere,
wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would of been
suicide. But going as members of the German film industry, they wear
tuxedos, and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor to fit
three tuxedos tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: How did you intend to get them into the
premiere?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Hand me my purse. They do. And she opens
it, and takes out three tickets to the film premiere.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Lt.Hicox was going as my escort. The other
two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Can you still get us in that premiere?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Can you speak German better then your
friends, no. Have I been shot, yes. I don’t see me tripping the light
fantastique up the red carpet any time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.</p>
<p>****: However, there’s something you don’t know. There’s been two
recent developments regarding Operation Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz, to a much smaller venue.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s
not very Germatic. Why the hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
peculiar?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: It probably has something to do with the
second development.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The
FUHRER, aka Adolph Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian
Corporal, having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago. The
FUHRER</p>
<p>****: I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris
premiere of “Nations Pride”. As the weeks have gone on, and the
Americans are on the beach, I do find myself thinking more and more
about this Private Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous for
us. And I’m beginning to think my participation in this event could be
meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: The Fuhrer’s attending the premiere.</p>
<p><strong>1 2 z.</strong>: Donny breaks the teams silence;</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: When the hell did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: The venue change, two weeks ago. The
Fuhrer’s attendance, four days ago.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: And how come London don’t know nothing
about that?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: We need to get something straight, once and
for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I don’t know,
London doesn’t know. So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s coming
to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>fuck a duck?</strong>: Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing
as he takes in this new information.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I’m thinking getting a wack at plantin ole
Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: What’s that suppose to mean?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: It means, your gettin us in that
premiere.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I’m going to probably end up losing this
leg, bye bye acting career, fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to
walk up a red carpet?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: The doggie docs gonna dig that slug outta
your gam. Then he’s gonna wrap it up in a cast, and you gotta good how I
broke my leg mountain climbing story. That’s German, ain’t it? Y’all
like climbin mountains, don’tch?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I don’t. I like smoking, drinking, and
ordering in restaurants, but I see your point.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: We fill ya up with morphine, till it’s
comin out ya ears. Then just limp your little ass up that rouge
car-pet.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Splendid. When the Nazi’s put me up against
a wall, it won’t hurt so much. I know this is a silly question before I
ask it, but can you American’s speak any other language then
English?</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Other then Yiddish?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Preferably. Donny referring to Aldo and
himself.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: We both speak alittle Italian.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: With a atrocious accent, no doubt. But that
doesn’t exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don’t have a good ear for
Italian. So you mumble Italian, and brazen through it, is that the
plan?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: That’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: That sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: it sounds like shit, but what else we
gonna do, go home?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it, with
that, I can get you in the building. So, who does what?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Well I speak the most Italian, so I’ll be
your escort. Donowitz speaks the second most, so he’ll be your Italian
cameraman. And Hirschberg third most, so he’ll be Donnys assistant.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: I don’t speak Italian.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Like I said, third best. Just keep your
fuckin mouth shut. In fact why don’t you start practising, right
now.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: What about the little one?</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: Do you mean me?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I didn’t mean any offence.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: None taken you German cunt.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Utivich is the chauffeur.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: I can’t drive. Bridget SCREAMS in
frustration;</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: You Americans are fucking useless!</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: IVGimmie a break, I’m from Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours
before the movie tomorrow. More then enough time for you to learn to
drive.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: NO no no no, Lieutenant, it’s not!</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is. And yes
yes yes yes, you will. Look Utivich, you and I both know, if we went to
grade school together, you damn sure ain’t copyin off of my test. Well I
lern’t to drive in four hours on a Tennessee mountain road. And I’m a
shit for brains coal miner bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how to
drive, right?</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Teach ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: But there is a problem. I’m a movie star.
This is a movie premiere. I can’t show up looking like I was just in a
Nazi gun fight. Now I have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But
sometime tomorrow, I have to get my hair done. All The Basterds, except
Donny, burst out laughing.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess
who went to beauty school? The CAMERA WHIP PANS to SGT.DONOWITZ. Bridget
rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>int - shosannas and marcels living quarters - night</strong>:
We’re in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the cinema. We’ve
never been in here before.</p>
<p><strong>night of “nation’s pride” premiere</strong>: She’s standing
before a full length mirror, in a real attractive Forties style dress
for the premiere. She’s stunning. This is the first time in her life
she’s had the opportunity, or the occasion to wear something like this.
Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the
present. SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich Marches, can be heard
coming from below. Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks
down at the Germatic miasma below.</p>
<p><strong>shosannas pov</strong>: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons
of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos, and
female finery, walking up the long red carpet leading into Shosannas
cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio and Film
crews covering the event for the fatherland back home. And of course,
MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security for this joyous Germatic
occasion. Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it. A GERMAN S.S.
GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR, the lugi HITS him
right on his bald head. Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror,
places a very fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out a small
GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it’s on. She exits the
apartment door, to join the premiere. From this point on, there’s no
turning back, it’s all the way baby, all the fucking way!</p>
<p><strong>int - cinema stairwell - night</strong>: The stairwell in the
building that connects the living quarters, with the cinema. She walks
down the stairs, goes through a door that puts her next to the
projection booth door. She takes out a key and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>int - projection booth - night</strong>: Marcels prepping the
film reels for tonight. The five silver metal film cans that carry one
35mm reel of film each are laid out. The cans for reels one and two are
empty. Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and
can for reel five lie in wait. Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie
star, enters the projection booth. The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in
ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this is so
exciting. Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Shut up fool. Marcel lifts up the veil
covering her face, and their lips meet.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and
socialize with these Hun pigs. Let’s go over it again?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two
is on the second. Three and four are ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Okay, the big sniper battle in the film
begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film, comes on in the
forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and
lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place behind the
screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>int - cinema lobby - night</strong>: The pageantry of the
evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people, enter the
cinema. They mingle in the swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered
lobby. Nazi Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and
German Celebrities, hob knob and drink Champagne from passing WAITERS
who carry glasses on silver trays. We see Shosanna enter from the area
at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby
parlor entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
theatre stuff. At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master
race in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his finest
SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.</p>
<p><strong>camera frame</strong>: directly behind him. On the right
side, we see the figure of Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests
entering the cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the building.</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book,
appears on the left side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside
of Landas think bubble, a little scene plays out.</p>
<p><strong>think bubble</strong>: Inside a hospital room filled with
DOCTORS, NURSES, and a PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters
the room, and screams at everybody;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I want everybody out of this room! They
start to leave.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: That means now, goddamnit! They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none other then
SGT.WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive. Landa pulls up a chair next to the
bed, sits down.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Can you speak, Sgt?</p>
<p>****: Yes Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Tell me everything that happened in
there? The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again, and
as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark, dressed lovely,
leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in their tuxedos, flank
her.</p>
<p><strong>cu col.landa</strong>: smiles. He descends the stairs,
towards the four saboteurs… They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in
ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what has
befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Colonel Landa, it’s been years. Dashing as
ever I see.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Flattery will get you everywhere,
fraulein. They chuckle, and air kiss.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: So what’s happened to your lovely leg, a
by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Save your flattery, you old dog. I know too
many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot.
Chuckle-chuckle…</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Seriously, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might
add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured
your leg, mountain climbing?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Believe it or not, yes it is. A brief
moment passes between the two…</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS
LAUGHTER. So uproarious in fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the
four saboteurs. The Colonel begins to regain his composure…</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Forgive me, fraulein. I don’t mean laugh
at your misfortune. It’s just .mountain climbing? I’m curious fraulein,
what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell
you that.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle
Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
yesterday morning.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this
mountain? This stops her for a seconded. Then Landa laughs it off,
taking them off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I’m just teasing you, fraulein. You know
me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts?</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: I’m afraid neither three speak a word of
German. Their friends of mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Antonio Margheriti. A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco. The German fraulein turns
to the three tuxedo wearing Basterds.</p>
<p>****: Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col. Sans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they
can’t show it.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Margheriti…?</p>
<p>****: Am I saying it correctly…? .Margheriti?</p>
<p>****: Yes. Correct.</p>
<p>****: Margheriti…. Say it for me once please…?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Margheriti.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, again…?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I4argheriti.</p>
<p>****: Once more… .?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Margheriti.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Nargheriti.</p>
<p>****: It means daisies, I believe. Turning his gaze to Donny.</p>
<p>****: What’s your name again?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Enzo Gorlomi.</p>
<p>****: Again… .?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Gorlomi.</p>
<p>****: One more time, but let me really hear the music in it.</p>
<p>****: Gorlomi. Now to Hirschberg…</p>
<p>****: And you? Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of
the</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Dominick Decocco.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Dominick Decocco?</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Dominick Decocco.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Bravo… . Bravo.</p>
<p>****: Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats.
Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.</p>
<p>****: Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne. Everyone gets a
glass.</p>
<p>****: - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us, I have some friends
I’d like you to meet. Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a
champagne glass. This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of
Shosanna.</p>
<p>****: May I say Mademoiselle, you look divine.</p>
<p>****: Merci’.</p>
<p>****: This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux,
this is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening.</p>
<p>****: And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none worse for the
wear German goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Bon jour.</p>
<p>****: I’m afraid my companions don’t speak any French, there Italian.
This is Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick. All three smile goofy spaghetti
bender smiles.</p>
<p>****: Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks Italian associates, need
help finding there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind
to escort them?</p>
<p>****: It would be my pleasure. Let me see your tickets? Donny hands
her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her. Donny and
Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young
french girl into the auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>int - auditorium - night</strong>: The cinema auditorium is
filling up quickly with grey and black uniforms. Shosanna finds the two
counterfeit Italians their seats. After she points out their seats, she
turns to leave… Hirschberg… .reaches out and grabs her wrist. He looks
her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt, because if he’s
successful tonight he’s going to blow this cute French girl to
smithereens, he says;</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Grazie.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Prego.</p>
<p><strong>back to lobby</strong>: They begin flicking the lights on and
off. A GERMAN SOLDIER YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;</p>
<p><strong>german soldier</strong>: Take your seats! The show is about
to begin! Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are
still together.</p>
<p>****: I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn’t want to make his entrance
untill everybody seated. Come with me Frau Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer
has heard your here, and he wishes to commend you personally.</p>
<p>****: Me? Why?</p>
<p>****: Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with your resolve. A
accident, like you’ve just experienced, and yet you still show up to to
a important Party event. The Fuhrer was quite adamant in his gratitude.
We’ll use Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office. I’m afraid I must rob you of
your companion, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>****: Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes to commend me.</p>
<p>****: Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain her long. What are
ether of them suppose to do, argue? Col.Landa goes over to one of the
Nazi GAURD/USHER, and whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like
he’s saying, leave the boy alone, till we come back… .Or is he?
Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office. As Aldo stands in
the lobby, more and more people enter the auditorium, till it’s only
Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers in the now vacant lobby.</p>
<p><strong>int - shosanna’s office - night</strong>: Shosanna’s cinema
manager office. It’s small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk. They
both enter. Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT. Bridget
notices, but says nothing. Now the two Germans are alone.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Have a seat fraulein. Pointing at one
lone chair in front of the desk. She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk, opposite her.
The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over, and places it in front
of the fraulein. He sits. Their knees almost touching. The colonel
points to the foot not in the cast.</p>
<p>****: Let me see your foot.</p>
<p>****: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Put your foot in my lap.</p>
<p><strong>bridget</strong>: Colonel, you embarrass me.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I assure you fraulein, my intention is
not to flirt. Patting his lap more with more aggression. The nervous
fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed foot, and places it in
the Colonel’s lap. The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin
straps that hold the frauleins shoe on her foot… .He removes the shoe…
.Leaving only the frauleins bare foot…</p>
<p><strong>then…</strong>: He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the
pretty dress shoe the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane… He slips it
on her foot… .it fits like a glove. Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.
Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: What’s that American expression… “if the
shoe fits…you must wear it”. He removes her foot from his lap.</p>
<p>****: What now Colonel?</p>
<p>****: Do you admit you treachery? She stares defiant daggers into
him.</p>
<p>****: The only thing I will admit to, is resisting you…</p>
<p>****: Sons-a-bitches..</p>
<p>****: .to my last breath.</p>
<p>****: “Resist to your last breath”?</p>
<p><strong>suddenly…</strong>: Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong
mitts around Bridget Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with
all the violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face BULGE, and her
esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP. With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO
THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP
around her throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on the
elegant ladies neck. Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING
THE BACK OF</p>
<p><strong>bang?</strong>: She’s dead. He releases the grip around her
throat. His hands are</p>
<p><strong>trembling…</strong>: He rises. Strangling the very life out
of somebody with your bear hands, is the most violent act a human being
can commit. Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the sheer violence
he had to call on to accomplish this task, still surges through him. He
tries to gain control of the trembling, that is rippling through his
body. He takes out a silver SS FLASK, and knocks back a couple of swigs.
He holds his hand out in front of him. The TREMBLING is beginning to
subside. He picks up the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Inform The Fuhrer the audience has taken
there seats, and we’re ready to begin. Step one, in Hans master plan,
done. He then dials another number…</p>
<p><strong>int - lobby - night</strong>: Aldo in the lobby…</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: .he’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS… He’s
THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern day Secret
Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed behind his back, he’s
searched, they find the BOMB attached to his ankle, it’s removed, a
BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his head, then he’s hoisted up, and
RUSHED out of the building. This happens in mere seconds, and quietly
too, no one in the auditorium is none the wiser…</p>
<p><strong>int - auditorium - night</strong>: ,including Donowitz and
Hirschberg, sitting amongst the master race, waiting for showtime.</p>
<p><strong>ext - cinema - night</strong>: The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle
the hooded Aldo, down the red carpet, then into the alley besides the
cinema. Aldo’s put up against a wall. Inside the black hood, he’s
SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food,
German shepherd… anything.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa’s voice</strong>: Shut up! The faceless black hood
does. Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner,
says in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt.Aldo
Raine, I presume?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Hans Landa?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas,
your now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they’ve been
waiting along time, to touch you. He reaches out with his finger, and
lightly touches Aldo’s face right in the middle of the hood. Aldo’s head
VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Caught ya flinching. In German, he orders
the men put Aldo in the back of a truck. Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put
in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift
chauffeurs uniform, bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant. The Truck
drives off. Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca,
and the rest of the entourage, make there way down the red carpet into
the cinema. Landa smiles.</p>
<p><strong>ext truck - night</strong>: We see the truck leaving the city
of Paris, under the veil of night. We also seem to be leaving the drama
of Operation Kino.</p>
<p><strong>int - truck - night</strong>: The two hooded prisoners,
bounce along in the back of the truck. Utivich, is crying inside his
hood.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Utivich?</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: Is that you Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>utivic}i</strong>: Do you know what happened to Donny?
Hirchberg? The woman?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: No I do not.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Nothin to be sorry about, son. This bag,
get to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: Not exactly John Wayne, am I?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: John Waynes a pampered movie star. He burst
into tears, if his cook, busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin a
bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes. Utivich, giggles
through the tears.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I just want you to know, son, I was real
proud of you tonight. Learnin how to drive overnight. Driving in that
Limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich Cries LOUDER. Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and
places his foot on top. The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on
Utivich. In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.</p>
<p><strong>ext- country tavern - night</strong>: The truck pulls up to a
small tavern outside of Paris , The two hooded prisoners, are walked
inside the establishment.</p>
<p><strong>int - country tavern - night</strong>: The hooded men are
lead into the closed for business, but open for something else, rustic
tavern.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Italian? Really?</p>
<p>****: What could you have possibly been thinking?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Well, I speak alittle Italian -</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn’t
begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don’t get me wrong, I
understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And
I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still…. Chico Marx is
more convincing. if the three of you had shown up to the premiere
dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing. Landas
eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.</p>
<p>****: You may leave us. But stay alert outside. They exit, leaving
the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the Private and a German Radio Man in the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: So your Aldo the Apache?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: So your The Jew Hunter?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Jew Hunter, , I’m a detective. A damn
good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally, I worked
for the Nazi’s finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews. But Jew
Hunter? Just the name that stuck.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: Well you do hafts admit, it is catchy.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Do you control the nicknames, your
enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and The Little Man?</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: What do you mean, The Little Man?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: The Germans nickname for you.</p>
<p><strong>utivich</strong>: The Germans nickname for me is, The Little
Man?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Or “The Little One, ether one means you.
And as if to make my point, I’m a little surprised how tall you were in
real life. I mean, your a little fellow. But not circus midget little,
as your reputation would suggest.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Where is my men? Where is Bridget Von
Hammersmark?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I’m sure
she’s in whatever, big bubbling cesspool in hell, the devil reserves for
traitors of her ilk.</p>
<p>****: Well, lets just say, she got what she deserved. And when you
purchase friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your Pisanos, Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: How do you know our names?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Lt.Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t
interrogate every single one of your swastika marked survivors… .? We
simply aren’t operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. Now,
back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. At this moment,
both Hirschberg, and Donowitz, should be sitting in the very seats we
left them in. Seats, 0023 and 0024, if my memory serves. Explosives,
still around there ankle, still ready to explode. And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go. The two
Basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: That’s a pretty exciting story. What’s
next, Eliza on the ice?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: However, all I have to do, is pick pick
up that phone right there. Inform the cinema, and your plans kupet.</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: IF, their still there, and IF their still
alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no way, you gonna take them
boys without settin off them bombs.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die.,
and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very
very mad at you for what you’ve done to his big night. But you won’t get
Hitler, you won’t get Goebbels, you won’t get Gering, and you won’t get
Boorman. And you need all four to end the war.</p>
<p>****: But if I don’t pick up that phone, right there, you may very
well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war…tonight. The
Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills three glasses. As
he pours, he says;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: So gentlemen, lets discuss the prospect
of ending the war-tonight. All three have their Chianti filled
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: So the way I see it, since Hitlers death,
or possible rescue, rests solely on my reaction…If I do nothing …it’s as
if I’m causing his death, even more then yourselves. Would you
agree?</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: How about you Uitivich?</p>
<p><strong>uitivich</strong>: I guess so too.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Good, we more or less, all agree.
Gentlemen, I have no intention, of Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
and Killing Gerring, and killing Boorman, not to mention winning the war
single handedly for the allies, only later, to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: If you want to win the war, tonight, We
have to make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: What kinda deal?</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: The kind you wouldn’t have the authority
to make. However, I’m sure this mission of yours, has a commanding
officer? A General, I’m betting. For ..</p>
<p>****: .O.S.S. would be my guess. Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a
good guess.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the way you
say it, That’s a bingo?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: You just say, bingo.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where were
we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two way radio. And
sitting behind it, is a more then capable radio operator, named Herrman.
Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the
pen, to authorize my - Let’s call it, the terms of my conditional
surrender, if that taste better going down.</p>
<p><strong>back to the premiere</strong>: Shosanna in the booth, she
brings down the lights. In the packed, excited auditorium, the house
lights go down. CU CURTAIN SWITCH, she flips it. In the auditorium, the
RED VELVET CURTAINS part. Shosanna, throws the lever on the first
projector.</p>
<p><strong>screen…</strong>: Goebbels and Francesca watch… Hitler
watches… Fredrick watches… Donowitz and Hirschberg watch… Shosanna, in
the booth, watches through the little window… The CAMERA PANS OFF of
Shosanna, to the clearly marked film can, REEL FOUR. The SURPRISE
REEL.</p>
<p><strong>back to landa and the hasterds</strong>: Landa, with radio
headphones over his ears, and a microphone in his hand, talks to the
UNSEEN/UNHEARD American Brass on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: .So, when the military history of this
night is written, it will be recorded, that I was part of “Operation
Rino” from the very beginning, as a double agent. Anything I’ve done in
my guise as a SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The O.S.S., as a necessary
evil to establish my cover with The Germans. And it was my placement, of
Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels opera box that assured there
demise. By the way, that last part is actually true.</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and
Francesca’s opera box.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I want my full military pension and
benefits under my proper rank. I want to receive the congregational
medal of honor, for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the
Third Reich.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: In fact, I want all the members of
“Operation Kino” to receive the congregational medal of honor. Full
citizenship for myself - but that goes without saying. And I would like
the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantuckett
island, as a reward for all the countless lives I’ve saved by bringing
the tyranny of the National Socialist party to a swifter then imanged
end. Do you have all that, sir?</p>
<p>****: I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.</p>
<p>****: He’s right here. The Colonel hands the headphones and
microphone to Aldo.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Yes, sir? We HEAR the VOICE on the other
end of the radio, give Aldo his</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Colonel Landa will put you and Private
Uitivich in a truck as prisoners. Then he and his radio operator, will
get in the truck, drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel
Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will then take over driving
of the truck, a bring them straight to me for debriefing. Is that clear,
Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Yes, sir. The Conversation is over, he puts
the radio down. The three men look at one another. Landa picks up his
wine.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: So I suppose the only thing left to do is
lift a glass, and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success. You too
Herrman, come over here. The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine,
Pvt.Smithson Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Gentlemen, To history, and it’s
Witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>we cut to the b/w film on screen.</strong>: Fredrick Zoller,
playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking
off RUSSIAN SOLDIER’s below.</p>
<p><strong>a russian general kchovlanskey</strong>: peering at the
German Private through binoculars. He lowers the long range glasses, and
confers with one of his OFFICERS.</p>
<p>****: What’s the death toll?</p>
<p>****: 47, so far.</p>
<p>****: 48. General, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!</p>
<p>****: That tower is one of the oldest, and most beautiful structures
in Russia. I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand years of
history into dust! A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two
buildings. Zoller, gets him. Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single
bullet at a time.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna in projection booth</strong>: She removes “REEL 4” ,
and prepares it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector,
playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to
be show time. Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in
ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium,
and take my place behind the screen. This is the last time they will
ever see each other, too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays
a one kiss before I die wet one on her.</p>
<p><strong>donowitz and hirschberg</strong>: sit in their seats watching
the movie, surrounded by DRESS UNIFORM NAZI’S. They’ve developed a dopey
way of communicating with each other in this hostel environment.
Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian. They say
English words, only adding a “I”, or a “A”, or a “O”, to the end of it.
And saying it in a exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier; They speak in
ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p>****: I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a. When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta
Boom-a. Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can’t set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazi’s. Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs,
setting bomb on ankle in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in
the back of the auditorium, in the dark. Hirschberg doesn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: What-a? Donny pantomimes again, more
exaggerated, and with less patience.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: They-o Look-o Screen-a, Not-o
You-a.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Fantastic-o.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: After-teri, Set-ta, Five-o
Moment-o</p>
<p>****: You-a, Pphisst.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: What-o?</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Confuse-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o ment-a “What-a”.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: After-teri, you-a set-ta boom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o Pphisst.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.</p>
<p><strong>sgt.donowitz</strong>: Good-a, Luck-a.</p>
<p><strong>15z.</strong>: Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out
of the dark auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down to the
WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the Boom-a, I mean, The
Bomb.</p>
<p><strong>descending the stairs</strong>: leading to the Water closet.
Like a lot of old cinema’s, not only was the water closet located under
the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to
get to it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers gossip.
They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed. Donowitz, in his
tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through them. They look up, but don’t
disturb there time off vibe. Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except
for ONE LONE NAZI ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole wash room to himself. He enters the privacy of a
toilet stall, locks the door.</p>
<p><strong>marcel in lobby</strong>: He descends the stairs leading down
from the projection booth, into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the
auditorium doors, and peers inside.</p>
<p><strong>we see the screen and the audience from marcels
pov:</strong>: in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick’s exploits on screen. Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY,
DEADBOLTS it SHUT.</p>
<p><strong>inside the auditorium</strong>: WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to
Marcel, who locks the two doors on ether side of the screen….due to
curtains placed there, no one notices Marcels actions. Marcel then goes
BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE
COVERING ENTIRE SIDE ROOM …A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay
like a junk pile, right behind the screen. Sitting down in a wooden
chair facing the screen, and Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a
absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it
matter?4. He smokes, and waits for his cue to… .BURN IT DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>fredrick in opera box</strong>: along side Hitler, Goebbels,
Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen the battle rages. He leans over and
whispers something in Goebbels ear, we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very
sympathetic face , and says in German;</p>
<p><strong>goebbels</strong>: Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go
now, and we’ll see you after the show. He exits the opera box. And walks
to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be
amusing way. The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
stares at him. Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm. They speak in
FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Are you the manager, of this cinema? I
want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks. He laughs.</p>
<p><strong>iv</strong>: She doesn’t even smile. She says, in all serious
business;</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I came to visit you.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Can’t you see how busy I am?</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Then allow me to lend a assist.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Fredrick it’s not funny, you can’t be
here. This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them. As
Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the charm at his
command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over,
and her big reel change is coming up.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Normally, you would be.right. And for all
the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the
proper sprit. However the fact remains, this film, is based on my
military exploits. And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing
many men. Consequently, the part of the film that’s playing now,… .I
don’t like watching this part.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Fredrick, I am sorry, but -</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: - So, I thought, I’d come up here and do
what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would
appear I haven’t lost my touch.</p>
<p><strong>donny in toilet</strong>: Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap,
sets the timer, six minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the
back of the toilet tank.</p>
<p><strong>camera on floor of water closet</strong>: we see the tile of
the floor stretch out before us. We see Donny’s feet in the closed
toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his
piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK THROUGH FRAME… .WE FOLLOW THEM TO… .The
SINK…WE STAY ON The Shoes …as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS… THEN…
THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG…Till…WE”RE EYE LEVEL with the German
Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who’s done washing his
hands….THEN….The Soldier removes his cap, brushes some bangs out of his
face, and WE CAN SEE</p>
<p><strong>the swastika hand carved into his forehead, undeniable
mark</strong>: OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts
his cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge.
As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;</p>
<p>****: Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes, now pay up.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna and fredrick</strong>: Fredrick still outside the
doorway, and Shosanna, still baring the way.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I have to get prepared for the reel
change.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Let me do it?</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Oh please, it’s been two years since i’ve
done a reel change.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: I said, no.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Come on, it’s my premiere.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Are you so use to the Nazi’s kissing your
ass, you’ve forgotten what the word,Â°Â°No” means? No Fredrick, you
can’t come in here, now go away! No subtitles for Fredrick needed this
time, he gets it. He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door,
knocking both it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room. Fredrick, a
different cat then we’ve seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the
door behind him, and LOCKING it. The quite startled Shosanna, says to
Fredrick;</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: Fredrick, you hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: Well, it’s nice to know you can feel
something. Even if it’s just physical pain. Fredrick steps forward…
Shosanna steps backwards…</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: I’m not a man you say, “Go away” to.
There’s over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could,
would testify to that. After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me
at your peril.</p>
<p><strong>back to washroom</strong>: The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get
a light for his cigarette. He takes a big drag.</p>
<p><strong>soldier’s pov:</strong>: He faces the washroom, and down that
long throw, he sees Donny emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo
jacket is off, and draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress
shirt, and black tuxedo vest. He’s quite far away, so now he just looks
like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit. Donny walks
toward us …</p>
<p><strong>cu swastika forehead</strong>: seeing him get closer…</p>
<p><strong>soldier pov:</strong>: Donny gets closer…</p>
<p><strong>cu swastika forehead</strong>: seeing him closer still…</p>
<p><strong>soldier pov:</strong>: Donny gets closer…</p>
<p><strong>cu swastika forehead</strong>: begins to notice…</p>
<p><strong>soldier pov:</strong>: Donny getting closer, begins to
notice, German soldier notice him…</p>
<p><strong>cu swastika forehead</strong>: now Donny is close enough for
the Soldier to recognize. His face SCREAMS;</p>
<p><strong>swastika forehead</strong>: The Bear Jew!1! The Soldier’s GUN
is out of it’s holster, and rising toward Donny’s chest…</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo
jacket on it, and FIRES a GUN concealed under it. HITTING Swastika
Forehead in the chest…Who finishes raising his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny
in the chest… The Two Soldier’s FIRE INTO each other…. Till there
weapons are empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor. The Nine other
NAZI’S in the room, stand shocked at what just happened in front of
them.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna and fredrick in projection booth</strong>: Fredrick
hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the door.</p>
<p><strong>fredrick</strong>: What the hell was that? While Fredrick’s
back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket, and SHOOTS
Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back… ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then
FALLING FACE FIRST to the floor… Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out
projection booth window into the audience… The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so
LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her weapon didn’t stand a chance of being
heard. Her eyes go from the audience… .up to the big screen… .Which
holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP. The Face on the
silver screen, breaks the young girl’s heart… .She looks to his body,
lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in
his back… .His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN…
.DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still</p>
<p><strong>alive…</strong>: Shosanna moves to him… ..She touches him,
and he lets out another MOAN… .She turns his body over on it’s back…
..he’s holding a LUGER in his hand… .he FIRES TWICE…</p>
<p><strong>bang bang</strong>: Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE
CHEST… THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her knees
to the floor… ..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the
floor…</p>
<p><strong>.fires…</strong>: HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in
the thigh… .SPINNING her BODY around in agony… Like he did to the
Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one bullet at a time…</p>
<p><strong>bullet blows off heel of her foot…</strong>: Luger drops to
floor, Fredrick DIES. Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the
projection booth floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED
with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and</p>
<p><strong>when…</strong>: ..the little bell on the 1st projector,
starts to ring, informing the projectionist, it’s time for The REEL
CHANGE. Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s
going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this fucking
reel change.</p>
<p><strong>cinema auditorium</strong>: The battle on screen continues
waging. The audience is riveted. The FUHRER watches, completely caught
up in the dramatic spectacle. He says to Goebbels in German;</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Extraordinary Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest film yet. Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to
Francesca, who proudly pats his hand.</p>
<p><strong>projection booth</strong>: Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and
fucked, with great painful effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR…</p>
<p><strong>auditorium</strong>: Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS
the BOMB on his ankle. Then stands up, and begins scooting past
everybody in his rows knees.</p>
<p><strong>projection booth</strong>: like the German heroine in one of
Riefenstahl’s mountain films, Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film
projector, like it was Piz Palu…</p>
<p><strong>film on screen</strong>: Private Zoller FIRING away from his
perch. In the top far right corner of The FRAME. WE SEE the 1st REEL
CHANGE MARK…</p>
<p><strong>projection booth</strong>: Shosanna hanging on to projector,
waiting for 2nd reel change mark, it’s a agonizing effort…</p>
<p><strong>behind screen</strong>: Marcel, smoking, waiting for his
cue…</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: get out of his xow, and begins walking
up the aisle in the middle of the cinema towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: SERGIO LEONE CU FREDRICK, he SCREAMS to
Russians below;</p>
<p><strong>movie zoller</strong>: Who wants to send a message to
Germany? In the top right of FRAME The 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON…</p>
<p><strong>projection booth</strong>: Shosanna TOSSES herself to the
floor, as she THROWS THE CHANGE OVER SWITCH on the 2nd Projector…</p>
<p><strong>ex cu projector bulb</strong>: BLASTING WHITE in our
face.</p>
<p><strong>shosanna</strong>: HITS the DUSTY ground HARD, NOT in slow
motion…</p>
<p><strong>shoots out of little projection booth window</strong>: hits
screen.</p>
<p><strong>cu shosanna</strong>: on floor, eyes close, last breath blown
into dusty projection booth floor. Like her family befor her, dead from
Nazi bullets.</p>
<p><strong>on silver screen matching shosanna ex cu</strong>: CAMERA in
the exact same placement, same background , SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP,
so on screen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazi’s, the way Fredrick
was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S
GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazi’s, brings to mind Orwells
“1984” Big Brother. HITLER and GOEBBELS React.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: standing in the middle of the aisle,
turns towards the screen. When he see’s Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s
gobsmacked.</p>
<p><strong>behind screen</strong>: Marcel sitting in the chair, with his
cigarette, before the</p>
<p><strong>shosannas giant face on screen</strong>: She stares down the
packed house of Nazi’s, and says in FRENCH;</p>
<p><strong>shosannas giant face</strong>: I have a message for Germany.
I’m interrupting your Nazi propaganda horse shit, to inform you
despicable German swine, that your all going to die. HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: react.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: smiles.</p>
<p><strong>shosannas giant face</strong>: And I want you to look deep in
the face of The Jew who’s going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>auditorium audience</strong>: While the shocked German
audience is transfixed to thescreen, behind the heads of most of them…
The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box…</p>
<p><strong>shosannas giant face</strong>: My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,
and this is the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel,</p>
<p><strong>behind the screen</strong>: Marcel takes his cigarette, and
FLICKS IT into the pile of nitrate film. ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling little Nazi’s, running in a panic,
as FLAMES LIKE</p>
<p><strong>out of a giant blast furnace, burst through shosannas
face,</strong>: and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema. The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES towards the exits…</p>
<p><strong>hirschberg</strong>: with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a
massive Day of the Locust SWARM OF BODIES… People frantically pound on
locked doors, trapping them to there grizzly fate. The FLAMES and FIRE
spread through thr auditorium… Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows
this is it.</p>
<p><strong>his ankle bomb goes off</strong>: right underneath everybody
in the room. The effect this has on the people in the room, is very
similar to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would have
on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms, heads,
torsos, and asses.</p>
<p><strong>donowitz toilet bomb</strong>: BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the
auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>theatre.</strong>: As MADAM MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS… Theses
SUBTITLES APPEAR ON SCREEN as if on a military</p>
<p><strong>ext – woods - morning</strong>: It’s a misty early morning,
in the woodsy area. The German truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back,
and Landa and Herrman in the front comes to stop. LANDA and HERRMAN IN
TRUCK CAB Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;</p>
<p><strong>herrman</strong>: These are the American lines, sir. In the
back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members of The Basterds,
Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich, both with their hands cuffed
behind there back. Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in
ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Herrman, hand them your weapon. He does.
Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: I am officially surrendering myself over
to you, Lt.Raine. We are your prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich, cuff
the Colonel’s hands behind his back.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Is that really necessary? As Uitivich
cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I’m a slave to appearances. Then Aldo takes
the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD. The bound Col.Landa is appalled.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: Are you mad? What have you done? I made a
deal with your General for that mans life!</p>
<p><strong>lt. aldo</strong>: Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t
give a fuck about him, they need you.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa</strong>: You’ll be shot for this.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: Raw I don’t think so, more like I’ll be
chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
heard that deal you made with the Brass. End the war tonight? I’d make
that deal. How bout you Uitivich, you make that deal?</p>
<p><strong>uitivich</strong>: I’d make that deal.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal. And that
pretty little nest ya feathered for yourself. Well, if your willing to
barbecue the whole high command, I suppose that’s worth certain
considerations. Now I don’t care about you gettin pensions, merit
badges, ticker tape parades, who gives a damn, let’s all go home. But
.1do have one question? When you go to your little place on Nantuckett
Island, I image you gonna take off that handsome looking SS uniform of
yours, ain’t ya? For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa
doesn’t-respond.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: That’s what I thought. Now that… .I can’t
abide. How bout you Uitivich, can you abide it?</p>
<p><strong>uitivich</strong>: Not one damn bit, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: I mean if I had my way, you’d wear that
goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker suckin life. But I’m aware
that’s ain’t practical. I mean at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans face.</p>
<p><strong>lt.aldo</strong>: So I’m gonna give you a little somethin you
can’t take off.</p>
<p><strong>cu col.landa</strong>: The Dagger has just completed carving
a swastika deep into his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>col.landa’s pov:</strong>: On the ground, looking up at Aldo,
bloody knife in hand, who straddles him.. And Uitivich, who’s next to
