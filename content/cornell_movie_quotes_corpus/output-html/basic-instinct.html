<p><strong>gus</strong>: Who was this fuckin’ guy?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Before your time, pop. Mid-sixties. Five or
six hits. He’s got a club down in the Fillmore now.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not now he don’t.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You guys know Captain Talcott?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What’s the Chief’s office doin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>capt. talcott</strong>: Observing.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: What do you think, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>the coroner’s guy</strong>: The skin blanches when I press it
– this kind of color is about right for six or eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Nobody say anything. The maid came in an
hour ago and found him. She’s not a live-in.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Maybe the maid did it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: She’s 54 years old and weighs 240
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>the coroner’s guy</strong>: There are no bruises on his
body.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It ain’t the maid.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: He left the club with his girlfriend
about midnight. That’s the last time anybody saw him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>the coroner’s guy</strong>: Ice pick. Left on the coffee
table in the living room. Thin steel handle. Forensics took it
downtown.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: There’s come all over the sheets – he got
off before he got offed.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That rules the maid out for sure.</p>
<p><strong>capt. talcott</strong>: This is sensitive. Mr. Boz was a
major contributor to the mayor’s campaign. He was Chairman of the Board
of the Palace of Fine Arts –</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I thought you said he was a rock and roll
star.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: He was a retired rock and roll star.</p>
<p><strong>capt. talcott</strong>: A civic-minded, very respectable rock
and roll star.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What’s that over there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It looks like some civic-minded, very
respectable cocaine to me, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>capt. talcott</strong>: Listen to me, Curran. I’m going to
get a lot of heat on this. I don’t want any… mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who’s the girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Talcott doesn’t usually show up at the office
’till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: They’re executives. They’re nervous about
everything.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Keep your three o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do
you want me to –</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: I said keep it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m Detective Curran, this is Detective Moran.
We’re with the San Francisco Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>the maid</strong>: Just moment. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>the maid</strong>: Sit, please. Just moment.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Ain’t that cute? They got his and her
Pig-assos, son.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I didn’t know you knew who Picasso was,
Gus.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re sorry to disturb you, we’d like to ask
you some –</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Are you vice?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: When was the last time you saw John Boz?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why do you think he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: You wouldn’t be here otherwise, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Were you with him last night?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: You’re looking for Catherine, not me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I’m Roxy. I’m her – friend.</p>
<p><strong>roxy</strong>: She’s out at the beach house at Stinson.
Seadrift. 1402.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>roxy</strong>: You’re wasting your time. Catherine didn’t
kill him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ms. Tramell?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m De…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: How did he die?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Really. Maybe that’s why you’re from
Homicide. How?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: With an ice pick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How long were you dating him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wasn’t dating him. I was fucking
him.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What are you – a pro?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. I’m an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How long were you having sex with him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: About a year and a half.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Were you with him last night?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you leave the club with him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you go home with him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. We had a drink at the club. We left
together. I came here. He went home.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was there anyone with you last night?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. I wasn’t in the mood to have sex with
anyone last night.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let me ask you something, Ms. Tramell? Are you
sorry he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes. I liked fucking him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t really feel like talking
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you
–</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Read me my rights and arrest me and I’ll
go downtown.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sorry, Beth. I – I got hung up in
Stinson.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How are you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m fine. Come on, Beth! You know I’m fine!
How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I
suppose. Sit down, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s bullshit. You know it is.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know it is – but sit down anyway so we can
get it over with, okay?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: So – how are things?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Things are fine. I told you. They’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How is your – personal life?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty
shitty actually since I stopped seeing you – maybe I should think about
my Electrolux again.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How about the booze?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s been three months.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How about the coke?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No! I’m working my tail off. I’m off the
sauce, I’m not even smoking anymore.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How’s not smoking?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s fucked – now will you please tell I.A.
that I’m just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get
out of here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I still miss you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Talcott’s in there. They’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How’d it go, son?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She misses me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Sixteen stab wounds to the chest and neck.
No usable prints, no forcible entry, nothing missing. No prints on the
ice pick, either – it’s available at any Safeway. The scarf is Hermes,
expensive – they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The powder was cocaine, high- quality,
high-content. He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips
and penis. Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct
survivors. He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and
roll.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He liked the mayor, too, right?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What about his girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: Is she relevant here? I didn’t know she was
a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: She’s a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: On what basis?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors, no
convictions. Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980. Literature
and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor – Marvin and Elaine Tramell,
killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.
Estimated assets $110 million.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez,
deceased –</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Bobby Vasquez?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight
contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I love it. She’s got a hundred million bucks.
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she’s got a degree in
screwing with peoples’ heads.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You forgot her degree in literature.
She’s a writer. She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you
want to know what it’s about?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: It’s about a retired rock and roll star
who is murdered by his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Page 67, pop. Do you know how she does the
boyfriend? With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk
scarf.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Dr. Gardner?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’ve asked Dr. Lamott to consult with us. This
isn’t really my turf. Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho- pathology of
psychopathic behavior at Stanford and is also a member of the Justice
Department’s Psychological Profile team. Dr. Lamott?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lamott</strong>: There are two possibilities. One. The
person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing
described in ritualistic, literal detail. Two. Someone who wants to do
the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the
killing described to incriminate the writer.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What if the writer did it? What are we dealing
with?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lamott</strong>: You’re dealing with a devious,
diabolical mind. This book must have been written at least six months,
maybe years before it was published. That means the writer planned the
crime, at least in the subconscious, back then. The fact that the writer
carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not
only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense
mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Most times I can’t tell shit from shinola, Doc.
What was all that you just said?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She anticipates the book to be her best
alibi.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lamott</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She’s going to say Do you think I’d be dumb
enough to kill anyone in the exact way I’ve described in my book? I
wouldn’t do that because I’d know I’d be a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What if it’s not the writer? What if it’s
someone who read the book?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lamott</strong>: You’re dealing then with someone so
obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent
victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book. We are
talking about deep-seated, obsessional hatred; an utter lack of sense of
proportion or perspective.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: We’ve got a top-of-the-line, once-
in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way you cut it – that’s what you’re
saying, right, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lamott</strong>: You’re dealing with someone very
dangerous and very ill.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Come on, you know there’s no case here.
There’s no physical evidence – okay, she doesn’t have an alibi but
there’s no motive. Her defense would just beat us to death with the
copycat thing. Anybody who read the book could have done it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So what do we do – nothing?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: We bring her in for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: She’s got enough money to burn this whole
department down.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: She was the last person seen with the
guy – I’ll take the responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: It won’t do any good. She’ll come in with
Lee Bailey and Mel Belli trailing behind her on a solid gold chain from
Tiffanys.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: Yes she will.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No she won’t.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think she’s going to hide behind
anybody. I don’t think she’s going to hide at all.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: I think you’re as crazy as she probably is,
Curran.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You know what they say: It takes one to know
one.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ms. Tramell, we’d like you to come downtown
and answer some questions for us.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Are you arresting me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If that’s the way you want to play it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Can I change into something more
appropriate? It’ll just take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: How long will this take?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you always keep old newspapers around?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Only when they make interesting
reading.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You have the right to an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why would I need an attorney?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought you were out of cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I found some in my purse; would you like
one?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I told you – I quit.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It won’t last.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You workin’ on another book?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It must really be somehtin’ –makin’ stuff up
all the time.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It teaches you to lie.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You make it up, but it has to be
believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I like that. “Suspension of Disbelief.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s your new book about?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: A detective. He falls for the wrong
woman.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What happens to him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: She kills him.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: I’m John Corrigan. I’m an assistant
district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like
some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: Are your attorneys –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ms. Tramell waived her right to an
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I told them you wouldn’t want an attorney
present.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Why have you waived your right to an
attorney, Ms. Tramell?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why did you think I wouldn’t want
one?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I told them you wouldn’t want to hide.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: There is no smoking in this building,
Ms. Tramell.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What are you going to do? Charge me with
smoking?</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Would you tell us the nature of your
relationship with Mr. Boz?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I had sex with him for about a year and a
half. I liked having sex with him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: He wasn’t afraid of experimenting. I like
men like that. I like men who give me pleasure. He gave me a lot of
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic
activity with him?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Exactly what do you have in mind,
Mr. Corrigan.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Did you ever tie him up?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You never tied him up.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. Johnny liked to use his hands too
much. I like hands and fingers.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You describe a white silk scarf in your
book.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ve always had a fondness for white silk
scarves. I have a very vivid imagination.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But you said you liked men to use their
hands.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. I said I liked Johnny to use his
hands. I don’t give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow.</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d have to be pretty stupid to write a
book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book.
I’d be announcing myself as the killer. I’m not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: We know you’re not stupid, Ms. Tramell.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Maybe that’s what you’re counting on to
get you off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for
not killing him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes it does, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: The answer is no. I didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Did you ever do drugs with Mr. Boz?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What kind of drugs?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Have you ever fucked on cocaine? It’s
nice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You like playing games, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ve got a degree in psych. It goes with
the turf. Games are fun.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How about boxing? That’s a game. Was that fun
for you?</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: I think that’s irrelevant to this
inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes it was. Bobby died.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you feel when he died?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I loved him. I hurt.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz
had died – that day at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I felt somebody had read my book and was
playing a game.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But you didn’t hurt –</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Because you didn’t love him –</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Even though you were fucking him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You still get the pleasure. Didn’t you
ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: How did you know he was married?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Maybe I was guessing. What difference
does it make?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Would you like a cigarette, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>corrigan</strong>: Do you two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: How did you meet Mr. Boz?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wanted to write a book about the murder
of a retired rock star. I went down to his club and picked him up. Then
I had sex with him.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You didn’t feel anything for him. You
just had sex with him for your book.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: In the beginning. Then I got to like what
he did for me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That’s pretty cold, ain’t it, lady?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m a writer, I use people for what I
write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Would you like me to take a lie detector
test?</p>
<p><strong>the examiner</strong>: No blips, no blood pressure
variations, no pulse variance. Either she’s telling the truth or I’ve
never met anyone like her.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Well, I guess that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How does somebody beat this machine?</p>
<p><strong>the examiner</strong>: Ninety-nine point nine percent of the
cases, they don’t. You’d have to be able to mask the truth from your own
central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands. In
my opinion, this woman is telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms. Tramell.
I’m sorry to inconvenience you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Can I ask one of you for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s got to be tiring to beat that
machine.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat
that machine, it wouldn’t be tiring. It wouldn’t be tiring at all.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Because I’m a professional liar. I spend
most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I love the rain, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You took a polygraph after you shot those
two people, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I passed.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You see? We’re both innocent, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How do you know all this stuff about me?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You know all about me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know anything that isn’t police
business.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You know I don’t like to wear any
underwear, don’t you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: What is all this “Nick” stuff – Nick
would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She didn’t ask me for the ride. She asked
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: And you volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>the bartender</strong>: Perrier, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What you doin’, son?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s my first drink in three months. That okay
with you, pop? She doesn’t know me. I never saw her before Gus and I
talked to her.</p>
<p><strong>the bartender</strong>: Here you go, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: What now what? Now nothing. She passed
the polygraph. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She knew she could beat it. That’s why she
asked to take it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: How the fuck do you know? What is it
with you and this broad anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, Phil. You’re not gonna let this
slide. What about her parents? What about what else she’s published? At
least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that’s an
amazing real-life coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Her parents died in an accident. I don’t
care what else she’s written. What are you – a book critic?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did they die? Was there an
investigation?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: How you’re saying she killed her
parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not unless she got up in the ring and turned
into one mean sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew
herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.
Let’s polygraph her again and ask her about it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fuck you, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Fuck you, too Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can you get me another double Black Jack,
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: Hey, shooter – You back on the Black Jack,
Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: We’re discussing a case, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: I know that. I had no doubt of that.</p>
<p><strong>the bartender</strong>: Here you go, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: Double, huh, Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me? I’m
off-duty discussing a case. Internal Affairs shouldn’t have any trouble
with that. Maybe I should put in for overtime.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: You do that, Shooter. Why don’t you send it
to me? I’ll give it special attention.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m gonna tell you once more, Nilsen –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: No problem, Doctor. Here comes the Doctor
just in time to save her patient. Take care, Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You don’t look so okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Baby-sitting. Rookie cop.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What else is new?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You want to get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Maybe it’s for old-time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Sometimes I think he started banging her
just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He ain’t that way. He’s got heart.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t – please, Nick –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Please don’t – don’t –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Catherine Tramell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She said what you said she’d say.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I met her at Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We were in some of the same classes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’ve never been… like that… before.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re the shrink.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You weren’t making love to me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who was I making love to?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You weren’t making love.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I need a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I thought you quit.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Top drawer in the foyer. Get it on your way
out.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You look like dogshit.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: He looks a little shrunk, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was
a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds.
1977.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She was there, wasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: University records say she was
there.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Gus – go over to Berkeley. Harrigan –
find out what else she’s published. Andrews – get the files on her
parents’ accident. Carbon Beth on everything. I want some psychological
input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You’re already gettin’ psychological input,
son.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Go stick your head in a tub of ice
water. See where she leads.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Ain’t you go nothin’ better to do than to come
in here and jack off the damn machine?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you doing here, Pop?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I came in here to jack off the damn machine.
One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And
guess what? He was her counselor.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was she ever suspect?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No, sir. They never even got a statement from
her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you remember a case – 1956 – Hazel
Dobkins?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Hell yes! Couldn’t get it outta my head for
years. Still can’t. Nice little kids – nice husband, wasn’t porkin’
around – no financial problems. One day – outta the clear blue sky – she
does ’em. All of ’em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn’t
even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn’t know why she done it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Am I… disturbing you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m using you for my detective. In my
book. You don’t mind, do you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Would you like a drink? I was just going
to have one.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s right. You’re off the Jack Daniels
too, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’d like to ask you a few more questions.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d like to ask you some, too.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: For my book.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What kind of questions?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: How does it feel to kill someone?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t know. But you do.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was an accident. They got in the line of
fire.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Four shootings in five years. All
accidents.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tell me about Professor Goldstein.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: There’s a name from the past.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You want a name from the present? How about
Hazel Dobkins?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Noah was my counselor in my freshman
year. That’s probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book.
Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She wiped out her whole family.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes. She’s helped me understand homicidal
impulse.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Didn’t you study it in school?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Only in theory. You know all about
homicidal impulse, don’t you, shooter? Not in theory – in practice.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked
into it? Did you like it too much?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Tell me about the coke, Nick. The day you
shot those two tourists – how much coke did you do?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Tell me, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes, you did. They never tested you, did
they? But Internal Affairs knew.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Your wife knew, didn’t she? She knew what
was going on. Nicky got too close to the flame. Nicky liked it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s why she killed herself?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hiya, hon. You two have met, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re going to make a terrific
character, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: She’s on the phone – she’ll be right
with you, detective –He sweeps by her into Beth’s inner office. She
hangs up when she sees the look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who has access to my file?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are you talking about, Nick – what’s
wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who’s got access to my goddamn file?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s a confidential psychiatric record, it’d
be illegal –She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comes very
close to her – puts an arm behind her to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t, Beth. Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s Internal Affairs, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, Nick, please –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Nilsen.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: What do you want, Curran?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You sold her the file, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’d she pay you?</p>
<p><strong>one of the i.a. guys</strong>: Let him go, Curran. Nice and
easy.</p>
<p><strong>nilsen</strong>: You’re on sick leave, Shooter. As of right
now. Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What’s goin’ down, son?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothin’ I’ll be okay, pop.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: No, sir. You won’t. There’s smoke off yonder on
the horizon. They’re gonna want your badge.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I got tired of being played with.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You sure got real conclusive ways of
demonstrating that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She knows where I live and breathe. She’s
coming after me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What is it you got between you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Somethin’, though.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. Somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I still have my key.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t want to see you, Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Damnit! Don’t shut me out! You owe me more
than that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t owe you anything; you don’t owe me
anything. We went to bed – what was it? – ten or fifteen times? It
wasn’t memorable enough to carry any obligations.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Sometimes I really hate you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah? Well why don’t you find some friendly
therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a
little more life into it than you usually do.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m sorry… I don’t usually… act like that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How could you let him have my file, Beth?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: He was going to recommend your discharge a
behavioral disability. I made a deal with him. He could review the
session notes himself. It was the only way I could keep you on the
force.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You did it for me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes. I care about you. I did it for you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Get out of here, Beth. Please?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: One shot. Close range. Probably a .38 caliber
revolver.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Give me your gun, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think I –</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I don’t son, but I got the minority
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: Do you have any evidence that he showed
your psychiatric file to anyone?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: We’ll speak to you afterwards,
Dr. Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’d like to sit-in if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>the i.a. man</strong>: I’d really rather –</p>
<p><strong>talcott</strong>: I don’t see anything wrong with Dr. Gardner
sitting-in if Detective Curran doesn’t object.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: Where were you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Home. Watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: All night?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: Were you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, I was drinking.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: When did you start drinking again?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A couple days ago.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I saw Detective Curran at his apartment around
ten o’clock. He was sober and lucid. I asked him in my capacity as his
departmental therapist about his altercation with Lt. Nilsen. He
expressed regret and displayed no hostility.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: How long were you at his apartment?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: About fifteen minutes. I saw there was no
reason for my concern and left.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: There’s no smoking in this
building.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you gonna do – charge me with
smoking?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: I’ll ask you once, Nick – for the record
did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on – I’m going to storm into his office
in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I’m going to
kill him? I’d have to be really dumb to do that.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: Going after him before gets you off the
hook for killing him that’s your alibi.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: I don’t understand. What are you
talking about? What book?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Private joke.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think it’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Well, hell, son, it’s got a certain ring to it,
I’ll say that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll get my stuff tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Beth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s the least I could do… considering I got
you into this mess with those reports.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. I mean it, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my
reports?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She knows stuff about me that only you
know.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She must really be something. From a clinical
point of view.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What was she like in school?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps,
though. I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Get some rest. Promise?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Beth. I didn’t mean what I said. About –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes you did. I’m a big girl. I can handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Take care, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you find out about her parents?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’re on leave, man. You’re on psycho
leave. I’m talking to a possible whacko here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know I’m whacko, Sam, what’d you find?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The boat blew. There was a leak in the gas
line. There were two previous repairs. There was a five-mil policy on
both of ’em. A real heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-egg. It was an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: I.A.’s going to talk to you more about
Nilsen. They’re handling the investigation, we’re not. Stay in touch
with Dr. Gardner, it’ll help on the evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She killed him.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Beth? Now you’ve got Beth killing
people?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Catherine Tramell. It’s part of her game.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: First you’ve got her buying your file.
Now you’ve got her killing Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go someplace. Sit
in the sun. Get away from this goddamn fog. Get her out of your
system.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t but it, do you? She knew nobody
would but it. She knew I’d say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy
it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: She’s screwing with your head, Nick.
Pretty soon you’re gonna look in the mirror and think you’re seeing
her.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I heard about what happened. What good’s
a shooter without his gun?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How exactly did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I have attorneys. They have friends. I
have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know about that I don’t have any money
I don’t have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wasn’t talking about real friends. Why
doesn’t Gus like me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I like you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I didn’t think you’d ask me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not that easy to figure.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re not easy to figure. I’m just very
good at figuring.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t get too cocky.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can make a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You should put some warmth into it. You
don’t want it to reflect on your personality.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jack Daniel’s okay? It’s gonna have to be.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ice?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Let me do that. You like to watch me
doing it, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Can I have a cigarette, please? I told
you you’d start smoking again.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Light it for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did you pay Nilsen?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Isn’t he the policeman that you shot,
Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What if I asked you not to call me
Shooter?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What if I call you Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My wife used to call me that.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I know, Nicky, but I like it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Bitch mostly, but he meant it
affectionately. You don’t have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack
Daniel’s.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s Pepsi in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It’s not the same thing, is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s it going? What do you want from
me?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Say – “What do you want from me,
Catherine?”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you want from me, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Aren’t you going to thank me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: A boy kills his parents. They have a
plane. He makes it look like an accident.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why does he do it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: To see if he can get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When did you write it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You mean did I write it before my parents
died?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. I wrote it years afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re not going to stop following me
around now just because you’re on leave – are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Good. I’d miss you. You can get into
trouble, though. You’re not really a cop anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll risk it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why take the risk?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To see if I can get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’s your new book?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m getting deeper and deeper into my
character.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m leaving the house around midnight. In
case you’re going to follow me. I’m going down to Johnny’s club.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hi, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Forgive me for askin’, son, and I don’t mean to
belabor the obvious, but why is it that you’ve got your head so far up
your own ass?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She want to play? Fine. I can play.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Everybody that she plays with dies.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know what that’s like.</p>
<p><strong>roxy</strong>: If you don’t leave her alone, I’ll kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tell me something, Rocki. Man-to- man. I think
she’s the fuck of the century, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How long you been here, Rock? You like to
watch, do you?</p>
<p><strong>roxy</strong>: She likes me to watch.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: ’Morning.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think Roxy got jealous.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: She’s seen me fuck plenty of other
guys.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe she saw something she didn’t see
before.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: She’s seen everything before.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s never seen us before.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Did you think it was so special?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I told her it was the fuck of the century.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I thought it was a pretty good
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century,
too?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you want her to join us sometime?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I didn’t mean for me – I meant for you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m not as judgmental about women as I am
about men.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’s your shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Fine. How’s your back?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: We’re alike, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of
morning-after conversation?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you want personal insights and
adolescent secrets? I don’t do those.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You mean getting inside you isn’t going to get
me any deeper into your character.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Not unless you confuse my character with
my body parts.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Were you frightened, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought that business with the scarf was
pretty nifty.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I told you I had a vivid imagination.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You shouldn’t play this game.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re in over your head.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ve got a book to write. I’ll see you
around, Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What is this place? Hillbilly heaven?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Where in the fuck you been? I went over to your
place.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Easy there, partner – I wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I went over last night, too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wasn’t there last night, either.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You… fucked her! Goddamn dumb sonofabitch… You
fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not gonna get AIDS, pop –don’t worry about
it. I always use a rubber.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I don’t give a… flyin’… chili- bean… fart about
AIDS!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really
should.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What in the hell for? You think I’m gettin’ any
at my age? I don’t like blue-haired women. I don’t like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You don’t like punk rockers?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I feel fine!</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How could you fuck her?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You wanna die, son? What is it – those goddamn
tourists – you still feel so bad about that you’re wigglin’ your way
into an icepi – We got too many goddamn tourists comin’ here anyway –
plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not afraid of her.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just not.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: That’s her pussy talkin’ –He gets a real nasty
look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger. He winks at her. The
woman looks away from him, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It ain’t your brain.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin D for
Dickhead Nilsen. They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand
dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It doesn’t make sense. She didn’t know me
three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Maybe it wasn’t her that paid him. Maybe the
money was for somethin’ else. How the fuck do I know? I’m just an old
city cowboy tryin’ not to fall outta his saddle.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You all right, pop? You want me to drive
you?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.
I ain’t gettin’ no back pain disability retirement – I’m gettin’ me a
full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, I’ll drive you in this thing.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You think I’d let you drive my Cadillac car? I
ain’t lettin’ no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Tell me again. I want to hear you say it
again.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You’re driving around North Beach for no
particular reason and this car won’t get out of the way –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think she meant to go off the hill, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Don’t fuck with me, Nick. I don’t need a
reason to put your ass in a sling.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Full name, Roxanne Hardy. Last address –
Cloverdale, California. No priors, no convictions. The car is registered
to Catherine Tramell.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You knew her, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gus and I talked to her at Tramell’s house.
All we did was write her name down.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: I told you to stay away from
Tramell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. But you didn’t tell me to stay away from
her car.</p>
<p><strong>an i.a. man</strong>: I want you in Dr. Gardner’s office at
nine o’clock. You’re out of control, Curran.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this
time?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hello, Nick. This is Dr. Myron and R.
McElwaine. They’ve been asked to consult with me on this evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>dr. myron</strong>: Sit down, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>dr. mcelwaine</strong>: Nick – when you recollect your
childhood, are your recollections pleasing to you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Number one I don’t remember how often I used
to jack off, but it was a lot. Number two I didn’t get pissed off at my
dad – even after I was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in
the bedroom. Number three I don’t look in the toilet before I flush it.
Number four I don’t wet the bed and haven’t for some time. Number five
You can go fuck yourselves because I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What is your problem? I’m trying to help you.
Why won’t you let me help you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t need any help.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes you do. Something’s on with you. You’re
sleeping with her, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What is this interest you’ve got in her?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces
people, she manipulates –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought you hardly know her.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know the type. I’m a psychologist.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That means you manipulate people too, doesn’t
it, Beth? You’re a practicing psychologist – that means you’re better at
it than she is.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I feel sorry for you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Catherine! Catherine!</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I should have known. I came into the
house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely.
She left right after you. I shouldn’t have let her watch us. She wanted
to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you like her to watch?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you think I told her to kill You?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Everybody that I care about dies.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s OK. It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Make love to me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: For what… to set me up? She loved me she
wouldn’t frame me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, she didn’t… she never got jealous
before… she got excited. I don’t have luck with women. There was this
girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started
following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my
clothes. Lisa something… Oberman. It was awful.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought you didn’t do adolescent
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I never have before.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Isn’t it just beautiful? I love it here
like this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re still playing games, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No more games, Nick. I’m tired of playing
games!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then tell me about Nilsen.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You won’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I paid him $50,000 in cash for your
psychiatric file.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: About three months before I met you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d read about your shootings in the
papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my
character.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You paid $50,000 for your character?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I would’ve paid more. I wanted to know
everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed…
it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about the other night. What about last
night? Was that to get to know your character?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Maybe I’m losing interest in my book.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ll convince you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It’s Gus-who-doesn’t-like-me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Catherine says you don’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: She’s right. You got an icepick in you yet?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Funny.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You know that stuff they say about how you can
judge people by their friends?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re my friend, Gus.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m gonna make you believe in it, friend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How old was she when this happened?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until
they’re deceased. That’s why you didn’t find it in your computer.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What was the motive?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: She said she didn’t know herself, just
sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: That’s what she said.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t understand what the hell’s going on
here, pop.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Ain’t that hard, son. This young farmgirl, she
got tired of all that attention goin’ to her little brothers – she fixed
’em. Just like ’ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family – except young
Roxy here, she didn’t use a wedding present. She used Daddy’s razor.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It sure makes you wonder what they talked about
when they set themselves down in front of the campfire at night. You
ever met any of her friends who hasn’t killed somebody.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: It musta beat your ordinary everyday girl
talk.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not sure anymore she did it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Which one you talkin’ about now, son? We know
ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it – and the other one Well,
hell, she’s got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up
your brain.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Anderson. Jack W. Donald M. I’m sorry. No
Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you check all four years?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can you check again?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: No Lisa Anderson, detective.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can there be some mistake?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Only if you’re making it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hazel , this is Nick. I told you all
about him. This is Hazel Dobkins.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: You’re the Shooter, aren’t you? How are
you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Honey, why don’t you go in the car? I’ll
be right there.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Goodbye, Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You like to hang out with murderers or what?
Did you know Roxy –</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Of course I knew.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Look. Sometimes when I do my research, I
get involved with people. It happened with you, too.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Killing isn’t like smoking. You can
quit.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ve go to go. I promised to get her home
by six o’clock. She just loves “America’s Most Wanted.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There was no Lisa Anderson at Berkeley when
you were there.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What were you doing, checking up on me?
What for?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Henderson. Lisa Henderson. With an H.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I can get my butt kicked for this. You’re
not supposed to be in here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s not gonna take long, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Bring it up, will you, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Hey, that’s Dr. Gardner, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Bring 1976 up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You shouldn’t leave your door open.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t. Something’s wrong with my lock.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What do you want, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tell me about Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She told you, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did she tell me, Beth?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I slept with her once in school. I was just a
kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a…
fixation… on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind
of clothes I did. It scared me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Isn’t that what she told you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She told me it was you. You wore the same kind
of clothes. You dyed your hair blonde.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I did dye my hair. It didn’t have anything to
do with her. I was a redhead for a while, too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you know Noah Goldstein?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I had him in two classes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You saw all the reports, Beth!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What do I say – Hey, listen, guys, I’m not
gay, but I did fuck your suspect. I was embarrassed. It’s the only time
I’ve been with a woman.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She’s really sick you know. Don’t you know
what she’s doing? She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah.
She makes up that story about me. She’s handing you somebody who’s
obsessed with he her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She didn’t hand you to me. She doesn’t even
know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She knew you’d find out who Lisa Henderson is.
You’re a good cop – what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem
irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That’s how I’d do it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why did you change your name?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I got married. He was on staff at the clinic.
I was down in Salinas. It didn’t… last long.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Nick – Do you really think I… that I could
kill someone… I never even met Johnny Boz. What about Nilsen? What
possible motive would I have to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You should do something about this lock.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: She’s evil. She’s brilliant. Be careful,
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do I scare you, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I just thought I’d surprise you. What’s
the matter?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I found Lisa Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Did you? What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re not going to tell me what she’s
doing. I thought we weren’t playing games anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I did, too. She told me it was backwards – she
said you even styled your hair the way she did.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: And you believed her? I even went down to
the campus police and made out a report about her.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You still think I kill people, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>campus cop</strong>: Who’d you say you were with?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Homicide. San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>campus cop</strong>: Don’t you guys communicate over there?
You must be the same way we are.</p>
<p><strong>campus cop</strong>: There was a report about Lisa Henderson
– January, 1977 – the file’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you mean it’s not here?</p>
<p><strong>campus cop</strong>: San Francisco P.D. Detective Nilsen.
Internal Affairs. You know him? Tell him we want it back. He’s had it a
whole year.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: So Nilsen had a report on her – so what. You
don’t know what the hell was in it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Catherine told me what was in it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: If she’s telling you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny
Boz to frame Catherine – she wouldn’t want anyone to know what happened
at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: How did she know Nilsen knew about it – if it
happened?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He was I.A. He probably asked her about
it.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: She’d have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound
Christmas fruitcake. She’s not the one who hangs out with multiple
murderers – your girlfriend is.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s a writer – it’s part of what she
does.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Goddamn writers – all they do is use up trees
and ruin people’s eyes. There’s gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows
what the hell happened.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know what happened. Catherine told me what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin’ around
your head, that’s what you got. You think you’re gonna fuck like minks,
raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’d you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I decided to give you one more chance. I
missed you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You didn’t not see me long enough to miss
me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Did you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Come over here and tell me no.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s below the belt.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Not yet it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: But we’re getting there.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have to do some research tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m very good at research. I’ll help
you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What are you researching?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m writing a book.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Really. What are you writing about.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What happens to them?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live
happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It won’t sell.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Somebody has to die.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Somebody always does.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi, I’m looking for a Dr. Gardner?</p>
<p><strong>one woman</strong>: We don’t have a Dr. Gardner on staff
here.</p>
<p><strong>the other woman</strong>: Dr. Joseph Gardner?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: He died – about five or six years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He was shot.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: He was walking home from work. They only
lived a coupla blocks from the clinic. Somebody drove by and shot
him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What was the weapon?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: .38 revolver. Never recovered.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Were there ever any suspects?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was his wife ever a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I had another one of you guys down here
from Frisco – about a year ago – he asked me the same question. What’s
this about anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Routine.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now
it’s two guys saying it’s routine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you remember his name?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Nope, can’t say that I do.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nilsen?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was she ever a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Nope. There was some talk; it never
panned.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What kind of talk?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: The usual – a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He had a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Nope. She did. Like I say. It never
panned.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I hope I helped you out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi. I missed you. I finished my research.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I finished my book.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did it end?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I told you. She kills him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Goodbye, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I finished my book. Didn’t you hear me?
Your character’s dead. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I’ll
send you some flowers.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What is this – some kind of… Joke? Are we
playing games again?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: The games are over. You were right. It
was the fuck of the century, Shooter.</p>
<p><strong>a voice inside</strong>: Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Right there.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Catherine Tramell’s roommate her freshman year.
I got a call from her. I’ve been calling people who were in her dorm all
day. She must’ve heard I was trying to talk to her. She says she knows
all about Catherine and Lisa Henderson. She’s over in Oakland. You wanna
come with me?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: You look like you seen a ghost, son?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Johnny Boz’s psychiatrist has an office on Van
Ness. Guess who he shares office space with? Dr. Elizabeth Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: What in hell’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Where the hell you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: She said alone – suite 405. It ain’t gonna take
long.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gus!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Put your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Put your fucking hands up! Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I got a message on my machine to meet Gus
here. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t! I know about your husband. You still
like girls, Beth?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Take your hands out of your pockets!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I loved you.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: What made you think she had a gun?</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: What the hell was she doing here? What
was Gus doing here?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>the forensics man</strong>: It’s departmental issue.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Thirty-eight caliber revolver.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: Lieutenant, you’d better come in here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: I guess that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: She must’ve heard you on the stairway
and dumped the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: There was no suite 405 in that building.
Catherine Tramell’s roommate in her freshman year is dead. She died of
leukemia two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>internal affairs man</strong>: Our files on Dr. Gardner show
nothing about a police report in Berkeley – nothing related to Salinas,
either.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ballistics says the .38 we found in her
apartment matches Nilsen. No registration. They’re checking with
Salinas. The icepick is the same brand and model as the Boz weapon.</p>
<p><strong>harrigan</strong>: We checked the tape machines at
Dr. Gardner’s apartment and at her office – both here and the one on Van
Ness. No message from Gus on any of ’em. The one at her apartment was
broken. Johnny Boz’s psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers
Dr. Gardner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house a year
ago.</p>
<p><strong>lt. walker</strong>: You just can’t tell about people, can
you. Even the ones you think you know inside-out.</p>
<p><strong>captain talcott</strong>: Congratulations, Curran.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I heard about it… on TV.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I can’t allow myself to care about you –
I can’t allow myself to care – I can’t – I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I don’t want to do this – please – I
don’t want to do this – I lose everybody – I don’t want to lose you – I
don’t want to –</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What do we do now, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live
happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I hate rugrats.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We
live happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I love you.</p>
