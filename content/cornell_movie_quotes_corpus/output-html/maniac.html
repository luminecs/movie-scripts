<h1 id="maniac">maniac</h1>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Tonight, my dear Maxwell, I am ready to
try my experi- ment on a human.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: At the morgue, there is a gas
suicide–an ideal specimen.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Have you made arrangements?</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: No! <U>You know I</U> <U>do not
work</U> under <U>prying</U> <U>eyes.</U> Very contemptuous. <U>You</U>
will find a way for me to work without detection. It is your chance to
show your <U>gratitude</U> for my generosity and protection.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I will never forget what you have done for
me and will do anything to help you–but the morgue–dead people–sup- pose
we should be caught?</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: How many times have you told me of your
imperson- ations–that you never had a chance.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: It’s horrible, I tell you! Working on the
dead; trying to bring back life. Max is excited. It’s not natural–
<U>you</U> with your weird ideas! Haven’t I stayed here and nursed dying
dogs–and– Notices Satan. –even that miserable cat. And for what–for a
measly roof and food. Because you took me in when I was down and
out!</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Once a ham, always a ham. <U>You</U>,
an actor! And don’t for- get, my dear Maxwell, the police will be glad
to find you. Max is very contrite–smiles wanly. Clears his throat.
MAXWELL Hm–I did not mean I wouldn’t–</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Of course not. In time <U>you</U> may
be a great man.</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: This is the one–here. Maxwell, papers
in hand, reads– MAXWELL File No. 26941–Maria Altura–24–suicide–carbon
monoxide gas–not claimed.</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Perfect–we will have to work fast. He
then starts a series of manipulations–massages abdomen in region of
heart– raises arms–works arms.</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: I must get her out of here– she must
have oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>1st embalmer</strong>: By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin’
heavier and more of ’em every day. They even got the coroner working
overtime.</p>
<p><strong>2nd embalmer</strong>: Yeah, between the gangsters and the
autos, we won’t need another war to carry off the population.</p>
<p><strong>1st embalmer</strong>: You didn’t even mention the suicides.
Did you notice the beaut that came in today?</p>
<p><strong>2nd embalmer</strong>: Did I?</p>
<p><strong>1st embalmer</strong>: That’s the one that’s got the coroner
doing nightwork.</p>
<p><strong>2nd embalmer</strong>: What–special autopsy?</p>
<p><strong>1st embalmer</strong>: Must be. I wonder who that old Santa
Claus is?</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: With twenty-four hours com- plete rest,
she <U>will</U> recover. Maxwell, thoughtful, seems a bit awestruck.
MAXWELL Think of it–life back in a body that sought oblivion. It’s
uncanny–the possibilities terrify me. Meirschultz is excited by
Maxwell’s speech. MEIRSCHULTZ Not a word of this out. This is only a
step. Cases like this have an element of doubt. I want a victim with a
shattered heart. Yes, a heart–that can be replaced by this beating thing
I have forced life back into. Now for my supreme accomplishment. Maxwell
you will get me such a victim.</p>
<p><strong>22 two shot</strong>: MAXWELL Not from the morgue. They’ll
get suspicious. Meirschultz grows more excited. MEIRSCHULTZ I don’t care
where you get it! From the morgue, the street– the undertaker! But get
one! The end will just- ify the means.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The undertaker around the corner. That
gangster shot today. Just the thing.</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Where is it? Very breathless and
excited. MAXWELL I–couldn’t get–it–</p>
<p><strong>meirschultz</strong>: Coward–</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Murder! Ugh. Slowly the realization dawns
on him; his remorse is turned to fear and terror. Murderer–and of my
bene- factor–horrible–how could I? Questioning. You should live–you have
so much to give the world. But has he? Why should the unconscious peace
of the dead be disturbed? Decisive. Isn’t the spark that moves the
maggot the self-same spark that moves the man? Preserving that spark in
the individual is not important. What we do with the spark while we have
it is important. Conclusive.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The formula for restoring life must be
here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Dr. Meirschultz, please.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: He isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: That’s terrible. It’s so very urgent.
Will you tell him that Mr. Buckley is having posi- tively alarming
hallucinations. Why, he thinks he’s the orang- utang murderer in Poe’s
"Mur- ders of the Rue Morgue." Tell the doctor I must have some definite
help.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: No–No–don’t do that–</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Meirschultz would be missed. Inspired.
Maxwell never would.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Not only do I look like Meir- schultz–I AM
Meirschultz. I will be a great man.</p>
<p><strong>58 interior–jones’ office.</strong>: Coroner, Jones and 1st
embalmer–Mike.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You say the corpse of a young woman was
stolen.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Yes. It sure has me puzzled. Mike thought I
took it out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sure and I would have swore it was the coroner
himself–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There must have been a strong
resemblance–?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The dead image! And talked like him too.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh, then you were speaking with the
coroner–?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No–He was a-talkin’ to an old fella looked
like Santa Claus– like I said to Jake– Mike laughs here like he did in
the morgue, then, seeing Jones’ stern face breaks off suddenly– Anyway,
he had a beard. And busy hair ’n ’n eyes kinda wild. Half to himself– It
musta been two other fellas.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Could you identify the man if you saw him
again?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I wouldn’t swear to anything <U>now</U>–since
I was so sure it <U>was</U> the coroner.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mike’s description sounds like your friend
Meirschultz. Have you seen the doctor lately?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Whuh, Dr. Meirschultz is a great research
scientist. Why, he has formulated some ama- zing methods for preserving
gland extracts in their most potent state. He’s no body snatcher.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Well, doctors and scientists often have
something queer in their minds. Anyway, I’ll look into it.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Go easy, Jones. I wouldn’t like to offend
the doctor–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Don’t worry. I won’t embar- rass you.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Collins, see if you have any- thing on Don
Maxwell, last heard from in this city. Impersonations in vaudeville.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Here he is, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Come in– You are looking well, Mr. Buckley.
What seems to be troubling you?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Nothing is troubling me. I seem to be
troubling everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I wouldn’t feel that way. Let’s talk it
over. Turns to Mrs. Buckley. How often does he have these spells?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: They are becoming more fre- quent. The
last ones have been less than a week apart.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: That is bad–let me see. Did we X-ray his
head for pituit- ary pressure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Oh yes. Don’t you remember? You
suggested operating after you completed your new experiment. But,
really, doc- tor, I am afraid to wait much longer.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Well, you know, we hate to operate on these
cases. It’s so delicate an operation and I have been awfully busy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Of course, James wants to be
cured.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Who said I did? Always scheming to try to
get me to sign papers. You’re trying to get rid of me–that’s what–
Soothingly but relieved. MAXWELL Now, never mind, Mr.Buckley. Nothing
will be done that you are not entirely in accord with.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: He always seems to feel some- one is
trying to take advan- tage of him.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I’ll give him a shot to relieve the nerve
tension. It may help him. We’ll try that first.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: There now, you’ll feel better– His
expression grows a little wild. BUCKLEY Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Don’t excite yourself, James. Be
calm.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Slipping. Creeping. It’s ter- rible. I
can’t stand it–</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Doctor, he seems worse instead of
better. <U>What</U> was in that hypo?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Pouring into my blood–darts of fire
stabbing my brain– agonizing–I can’t stand this –torment–torture–I can’t
stand it–I won’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: What <U>was</U> in that hypo?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: What’s this? He’s dead! Doctor, what
have you done? This looks like murder.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: No, no–not murder–my assistant–he shot
himself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Shot himself? When? Why I just saw him
an hour ago. Why didn’t you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: No, not the police. I wanted to bring him
back to life. I wanted to experiment on him. In fact, I must. I can
restore him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: You murdered your assistant, just to
experiment on him.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Well, I don’t know just what you mean–the
same language.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: We have a common interest. When you
bring your assistant back to life, his mind will do as you direct. You
can do that to Buckley too– To herself says: And he will do as I
direct.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: I’m going to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: No, you can’t do that–they’ll get
suspicious–</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Hm–with Buckley loose, they’ll get
suspicious if we don’t call them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Police Department? This is
Dr. Meirschultz’ office. An epileptic patient just escaped while here
for treatment. Maxwell listens to her explana- tion with wonder. He
imagines himself a monkey. He may frighten people … Please notify me
immediately … oh, no, he isn’t dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Why did you tell them that? You know he is
dangerous! Mrs. Buckley is still angry. MRS.BUCKLEY The police will
notify you as soon as they capture him … Now, it’s up to you to get him
away from the police without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: As soon as they call, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Buckley saw that body. The police–if they
come–I must bring him back. I must find that formula.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Howdy do, Doctor. A couple of my cats got
away–did ya see ’em?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Why, of course not. What would I want with
your cats.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: I knew ya didn’t want ’em. Still, I thought ya
mighta used ’em for some experiments.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Me-cats-never-oh-ah- Unconsciously he looks
quest- ioning–Then recovering That is, I think too much of Satan to use
cats for experi- ments.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: That’s what I thought. No harm meant,
doctor–</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: What am I going to do. The police will be
here any minute. I must dispose of the body. I’ll hide it–I’ll burn
it–no, I can’t do that–ah, the basement.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Satan–the gleam–you vic- ious wretch! Stand
between me and salvation, will you–</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Why, it’s not unlike an oyster –or a grape–
Perplexed. But the gleam is gone.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Picked him up stealing food. Seems to be a
little off. Hated to lock him up till you had a look at him.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: No-</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Who are you? What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: I don’t know, .</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes … hmm … You say she hasn’t been dead an
hour? Send up the officer that brought her in.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What made you steal? Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: No–I don’t want to give any money.
Everybody wants money–I’m not going to give any money.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Who wants your money– maybe I can help
you.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Maybe you want my money, too.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No, I don’t want money. I only want to find
out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not
taking their money.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: You–a friend to me?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Why, yes, to you, Mr.–Mr. –what?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: I don’t know–I can’t tell–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Try him writing. Amnesia victims will often
write what they can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Mr. Jones, I have news about that
corpse.</p>
<p><strong>105 buckley</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Write "boy," "school," "house," "home,"
"father," "his name," "born," "my name is–"</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: No, no! I won’t sign any pa- pers. You
can’t make me–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hm–pressure– To Buckley. That’s all right.
We’ll talk later.</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: Imagine–she was alive. What a horror.
Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the
morgue.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Never mind your theories. Was she ever
conscious?</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: Just before she died she came to–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Did she talk?</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: Said "doctor"–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: "Meirschultz"?</p>
<p>**[2nd officer**: How did you know?]</p>
<p><strong>107 buckley</strong>: Dr. Meirschultz–he’s the one-</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Tell me, just what you know of
Dr. Meirschultz.</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Papers–they all want me to sign papers.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Dr. Meirschultz, too?</p>
<p><strong>buckley</strong>: Yes–I can’t stand it– everybody wants
papers– oh, oh</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Take him to the psychopathic hospital.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Do you know a Dr. Meir- schultz and his
assistant, Don Maxwell?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sure–they’re sorta queer, I’d say. They’s
lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life
once.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: That sounds to me very remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It may be, but to my notion, those that
monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Maybe you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up
there last night.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Why didn’t you notify the police?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s their business–not mine.</p>
<p><strong>111 exterior.</strong>: Jones leaves and goes to cat farm.
Goof has bunch of cats around and nods to Jones.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I understand from your neighbors that all
cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a
complaint.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: He’s been stealing my cats to experiment on .
I know cause I’ve been spying on him.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How many cats you have–what’s the matter–
rats?</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Yeah–thousands, and right in my back yard.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at ’em–
Points to cages of cats.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’ s the idea do you sell them ?</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Oh, no. It’s my own idea. I’m in the business.
In the fur business.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh, I see. Cats’ fur.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: That’s it. You get it quick.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: But where do the rats come in?</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: You’re not as quick as I thought. I figgered
out that rats breed faster than cats– cat skins make good fur– The cats
eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the
cats. So –the cats eat the rats–the rats eat the cats. And I get the
skins–simple ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Cats eat rats– But, rats eating cats–that’s
news.</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his
assistant–he’s the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast
me.]</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: By the way–did you hear a shot last
night?</p>
<p><strong>goof</strong>: Maybe. I don’t know.</p>
<p>**[jones**: If I want any information I’d better go to the doctor
him- self.]</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’m detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell
you a bit of news.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: You found Buckley?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Not exactly. He has been seen, though. And
not far from here. There is also a report that he has been seen carrying
a woman. That’s fantastic, though, as no one has reported a woman
missing.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: That <U>is</U> a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: By the way, where <U>is</U> your
assistant?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, Maxwell? He’s left.</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: Hey, Maizie, we know you’re hard boiled. You
don’t have to stay in the water thirty minutes to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Aw–let me alone. I may not be decent, but
I’m sure gonna be clean.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Say, if anyone is entitled to first place in
that bathroom, it should be me. Didn’t I sign the register and welcome
you as secret guests? Why, if it wasn’t for nervy little Alice–</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Press–that reminds me. I have pressing
business.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Here’s one for the book. A sandwich man
pounding pave- ments. Walks into a wallet with forty-two grand in
it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’d like to find that man–</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: Maybe we could sandwich him in–huh?</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Can you imagine–the darned fool turned it
in.</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: His head must have been a jelly bean–instead
of the way they thought it was.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, it sure was soft, all right. But would
it be soft to land on to forty-two grand.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Yeah–but listen. After he turned it in,
people made such a fuss over him that he went "nutty." Thought he was
the Almighty in person.</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: So, that’s what being honest gets ya. A nice
soft padded cell in the bughouse.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: La Cucuracha–la cocka- roacha…</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: It is pretty tough. Imagine the poor guy.
I’ll bet nobody no- ticed him all his life. And then–say, wasn’t there
some guy in history that spent his life looking for an honest man?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sure–but in his day, men were men. Today,
they’re too scared to be anything but honest.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: But a brave man can sure get away with
plenty.</p>
<p><strong>125 full shot</strong>: Goes on looking over paper. MAIZIE
Say, you musta been readin’ the papers. Or maybe you been drinking
"crazy water" and your head’s Wrigley. Be yourself, Alice, playing the
heavy heavy don’t suit you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s getting me down–always broke–never a
break.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why don’t you ditch that ham and pick yourself a
<U>rich</U> husband?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Rich husband–I’ve heard they do come that
way–but not often.</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: Often enough–but not our way.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The girl has brains. We don’t need to put a
zipper on her skull to prove it either.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Alice! Listen to this–Don Maxwell,
personality imper- sonator, gets lucky break.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why, that’s your husband, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Pipe down–let her read it, will you?</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: "By queer quirk of fate, actor falls heir to
Australian estate. This paper is trying to find him. He used to be
around in vaudeville days, but we have not heard much of him lately.
Well, more power to you, Don. We thought some day you’d impersonate the
right guy."</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: The lucky ham–from now on he’ll have the
company of a good egg.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Will wonders ever cease? Our little Alice in
Wonderland–</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m in wonderland, all right– wondering if
that ham’s around. Say–I wonder if he’s still with that goofy
professor.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Scram for cover–who is it?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: It’s me-</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: Aw, nothing but old music in the ear. The
chorus girl’s bunion producer.</p>
<p><strong>marvel</strong>: Well, what’s news from the front?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Front, my eye–it’s the firing line.
Show’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>maizie</strong>: In the woids of Walter Win- chell–"There are
three kinds of actors–those on the screen, those on the radio and those
on their ears"– well back to the fan dance for Maizie.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Well, it may be the bread line for us–but Alice
don’t have to worry. She’s struck it rich –But I’m nothin but a
nothin.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: About time–after all that digging.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You bet, and I’m off to a fly- ing star. Now
you can <U>all</U> come up and see me some time–</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Say, when do I take these bath salts–before or
after my bath?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Your husband seems to be harassed about
something. Are you aware of it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Oh, indeed. I am very anx- ious to have
him cured. Dr. Meirschultz has been hand- ling the case.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So I understand. Has the doctor treated him
for–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Pressure on his brain. It can be
easily removed and all James’ worries will be over. Oh, I will be so
happy.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Do you realize your husband is in a dangerous
condition? Has Dr. Meirschultz tried any new theories on him? Very
explanatory –her sweetest manner. MRS. BUCKLEY Oh no. Not on my husband.
He has a theory about glands as stimulants. Why, he has brought dead
animals back to life. He has performed some amazing experiments.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Buckley, do you realize that you are
shielding a murderer–?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Why–er–what do you mean by that–why,
Dr. Meirschultz–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No, not Meirschultz. Your husband had a dying
woman in his arms when found.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: Oh, surely, the doctor can explain
that. My husband is innocent. You ask the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Tell me exactly what hap- pened when your
husband left Dr. Meirschultz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: He didn’t want to sign the necessary
papers to enter a hospital proper. The first thing I knew he had the
most terrible spell he has ever had. And before the doctor could help
him–there was so much confusion I fainted. When I came to he was
gone.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Then he did not take the young lady with
him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: He may have. I think I did see her
then. You had bet- ter ask the doctor. He can tell you exactly what she
died of–you’ll find she wasn’t murdered–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’m sure we can straighten this out. You have
been very helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>129 maxwell</strong>: I didn’t have anything to do with it.
They could not understand why he had not been confined long ago.
<U>You</U> knew he was dangerous. So did they.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: You can’t double-cross me like that.
You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put
him under my power.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your
idea!</p>
<p><strong>mrs.buckley</strong>: Say, what’s made you so cocky? Ushers
her to door. MAXWELL I have a plan–I would like you to help me carry
out. Be here at eight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Did you wish to see someone?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I understand my husband is– your assistant.
May I see him please?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Ah–he isn’t here now.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You mean he doesn’t work for you?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It
must be something important.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It is–you know what a struggle he’s had.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Indeed, he has often told me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s inherited a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of
any rich relatives.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He hardly knew of them him- self. I believe
it was his uncle in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I am certainly glad to hear it. I know
he’ll be pleased.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t tell him. I want to be the first to
bring him the news.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: That’s only natural. Maxwell will be here
around eight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Okay–I’ll be here at eight.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Well, news of Buckley?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yeah, he was picked up– also the body from
the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Why, Buckley stole that body. That’s what
alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley
in an institution but she wants to keep him.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So–that’s it. Buckley took the body.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U>
case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody–you have him haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh, yes, he’s in good hands now.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when
she gets used to the idea.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Do you have many patients, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh no. Mostly research in
endocrinology.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have
car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no
chances. MAXWELL Sure, I’ll take you thru.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s down there?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to
build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from
intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’d like to have a look.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Where did you say your assistant went?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: He? Oh, he’s away for a while. He’ll be
back, though.</p>
<p><strong>137 office.</strong>: JONES Thanks. I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p>**[maxwell**: Not if I can help it.]</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The gleam–it was in Meir- schultz’ eyes
when he wanted to murder me. It was in Mrs. Buckley’s eyes when she
wanted to murder her hus- band. Alice had that gleam in her eye when she
wanted to find me. She’d murder me. That’s what she wants to do. I must
get rid of her –but how–Mrs. Buckley– she will help. She must help– He
picks up phone. Mrs. Buckley, we are being investigated. The police are
suspicious of you … you are withholding information. … I think I have a
way out. Come over right away.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: We must get him out or we are
lost.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: You are right. But before I can get him
back here, you will have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: How? What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant’s wife, is
crazy. She thinks I mur- dered her husband. I want you to help me quiet
her– give her a shot from this hypo. down in the basement– there is a
secret vault . We will put her there till we get your husband–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: It sounds all right, except for the
fact that she’s crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea–.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to
other room. Stay in there–I’ll call you when needed.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I’m glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Gosh, you had me fooled.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Sh–sh–I want to have a few words with you
quietly.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So–friendly or otherwise–?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: At last, I have really a secure living for
us. We can travel or anything we choose.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Then you knew of the inheritance?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Sure–I have one little job to accomplish,
then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this
disguise.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, I wouldn’t be surprised at anything from
you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey–you are here in time to help me and
you can–</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I knew there was a catch in this some
place–but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I
have a crazy woman that I have been treating.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our
lives are in danger.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What do you mean "our"?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: That’s what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I
want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot.
You can take care of her till I get help.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: How about me getting the help. She’s quiet
now, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Yes, but she will break out any minute. She
is not afraid of a woman. Just push this into her arm. But keep it hid,
and all will be well.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: You here again?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a
little rough. He’s in the hospital. How about it?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that’s all. I had
a little trouble with him.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients
having a little argument.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Take me down there.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: It won’t do any good. They are a pair of
would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Man, you’re crazy. What kind of a place is
this?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh, <U>I’m</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you
something. Those women have–the gleam–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Come on, we’re wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Say, what’s behind that wall?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Take that cat away. That’s Satan–the
murderous Satan. The wretch that ate Meirschultz’ heart. He still has
the gleam– even in that loathesome one eye. It watches me–that gleam–
that gleam–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Quiet, doctor. What do you mean by the
"gleam"?</p>
<p><strong>165 maxwell</strong>: The gleam–it haunts me. Meirschultz had
it. He knew too much. He brought life back to the dead. He had to die.
Satan had it. Mrs. Buckley has it. She wanted to kill her husband. He
points to Alice. Alice wanted to kill me. Thrashes arms wildly. They all
know too much– want to know too much.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Listen to that! I wanted to kill him, did I?
Well, I should have done it–the lousy ham.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buckley</strong>: It’s the doctor! Then, who is
this?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Mrs. Maxwell, isn’t this your husband?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m sorry to say–it is–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Come on, Maxwell–</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The gleam–the gleam–they drove me to it! I
tell you, they drove me to it! I didn’t want to use my art for mur- der
or crime.</p>
