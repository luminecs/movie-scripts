<p><strong>title card</strong>: Fiction</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey, you want to hear my short story
now?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I can read it to you.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: You mean, again?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well, I changed the ending a little.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Oh. What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well, actually, it’s the same, but longer. I
think it’s better. More…raw.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Well then, maybe you should just read the
ending.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: But it won’t make any sense if you hear it
out of context.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I think you should leave it the way it was. It
was good.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: So you don’t want to hear my new ending?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: You’ll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.
Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I’d help her with her oral.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re tired of me. I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Marcus, I’m tired. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’ve lost interest…You hardly even sweat
any more when we have sex.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I was never much of a sweater. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Look, Vi, I don’t blame you. You feel You
feel pity now. The pleasure isn’t there any more. The kinkiness has
gone…You’ve become kind.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: “…but when he saw her…it was as if he could
walk like a normal person. His legs didn’t swing, his arms didn’t spaz
away…He wasn’t a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction.
No more cerebral palsy! From now on”CP” stood for…cerebral person. He
was a cerebral person.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I thought it was really good, Marcus…Really
moving and emotional.</p>
<p><strong>elli</strong>: Yeah, I thought it was really emotional,
too.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And I mean, really good word choices. It kind
of reminded me a little of Faulkner, but East Coast and disabled.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Or Flannery O’Connor. She had multiple
sclerosis.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: And Borges. He was blind.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Updike has psoriasis.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Um…Maybe I’m wrong, but, um, I’m afraid I
found the whole thing to be a little trite. Its earnestness is,
well…it’s a little embarrassing. And those adjectives, they’re a little
flatfooted. And redundant. I’m sorry, but…Anyway, what do I know? Don’t
even listen to what I say. I mean…</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Catherine is right. The story’s a piece of
shit. You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are
unable to construct a single compelling sentence. You ride on a wave of
clich�s so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of
grotesquerie. Ad your subtitle, ‘the rawness of truth’ is that supposed
to be a joke of some sort? Or are you just being pretentious? OK. Who’s
next?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Marcus, wait up!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Don’t be so upset. It’s OK…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about? What’s
OK?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: You know he hated my story also.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Your story was terrible!</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Marcus…You’ll write something better next
time!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Patronizing fuck! If you had just been
honest with me in the first place I wouldn’t have read it. I knew it was
shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: That’s not fair! I was honest! Just because I
wasn’t sucking up like that bitch Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well, I sure didn’t hear you voice your
opinion in there when it mattered.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in
fact , by what he said. And he’s so…convincing. I’m sorry if I let you
down, but really, I still say he’s just one opinion. I don’t even like
his books that much. They’re all so aggressively confrontational. I
don’t care if he’s won the Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You just want to fuck him. Like Catherine
and every other white cunt on campus.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: …But Marcus! You can’t just unilaterally decide
to end things. This is a relationship we’re talking about! A friendship!
You don’t just…Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: Vi? Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Yes. I’m OK. I’m totally OK.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I know that. Fucking cripple. Why do I waste my
time with undergrads? They’re all so…juvenile! Uch! I just thought
Marcus would be different. I mean he’s got CP!</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: What are you gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I dunno…go to a bar…get laid…whatever…Don’t
worry about me. I’ll be fine…</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Can I have a beer?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Hello, Vi.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean, I just didn’t expect
to run into you here, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Well, now you have.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Yeah, um, then…are you alone?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Can I join you?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Good. ’Cause I…um…I really agreed with
everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was…</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: And I also agreed with what you said today about
Marcus’s story. It is a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: You have beautiful skin.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might
become a really good writer.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Maybe. She’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Aren’t you going out with Catherine? I’m sorry.
It’s none of my business. I didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: I’m not ‘going out’ with Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a
writer?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Thank you for being honest.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: I have so much respect for you.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Can I just freshen up for a second?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: It’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Don’t be a racist. Don’t be a racist. Don’t be a
racist…</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: It’s a really nice place you have. Is the rent
high?</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Take off your top.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Now…take off the rest.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Bend over.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Oh, bu…uh…I can’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Say, Ni…</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Ni…</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: …gger.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: …gger.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Say, ‘Nigger.’</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Nigger.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: ‘Fuck me hard!’</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Fuck me hard!</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Say, ‘Nigger, fuck me hard!’</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Nigger, fuck me hard!</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Again!</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Nigger, fuck me hard!!…</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Again!!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re all…sweaty!</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: ‘…So John flipped her around and slammed her
against the wall. Jane braced herself: she thought about her mother. She
thought about Peter. She thought about God…and rape.’‘Say, ’Fuck me,
nigger. Fuck me hard.’’’ John’s flesh abraded her soft skin. There would
be marks. She acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did
what he asked her to do. She had entered college with hope, with
dignity, but she would graduate as a whore.’</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why do people have to be so ugly…write about
such ugly characters? It’s perverted. I know you all think I’m being
prisssy, but I don’t care. I was brought up in a certain way. And this
is…mean-spirited!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected.
Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the
hollowness of your characters.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I think it was a little bit racist.</p>
<p><strong>elli</strong>: It was completely racist, and beyond that I
felt deeply offended as a woman. As if a woman can only operate from
experiences of objectification.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Totally phallocentric.</p>
<p><strong>elli</strong>: And so weirdly misogynistic. I mean, why does
Jane go through with this? Is she stupid?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey, But wasn’t this a rape? Or …did I miss
something? Because I - I’m confused. Because if this was a rape, then
why would she be a whore?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It was confessional, yet dishonest. Jane
pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes.
She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn’t
follow through. She thinks she ‘respects Afro-Americans,’ she thinks
they’re ‘cool,’ ‘exotic,’ what a notch he ’d make in her belt, but, of
course, it all comes down to mandingo clich�, and he calls her on it. In
classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. But then,
how could she behave otherwise? She’s just a spoiled suburban white girl
with a Benneton rainbow complex. It’s just my opinion, and what do I
know…but I think it’s a callow piece of writing.</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: Callow and coy. Jane wants more, but isn’t
honest enough to admit it. In the end, she returns to the safety of her
crippled boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This is bullshit! Her story was the
truth!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>elli</strong>: It’s clich�d!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>vi</strong>: But it happened!</p>
<p><strong>mr scott</strong>: I don’t know about ‘what happened,’ Vi,
because once you start writing, it all becomes fiction. Still, it
certainly is an improvement over your last story: There is now at least
a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello, is this Pam?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Toby Oxman.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, fine. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: So what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: That’s what I was gonna ask you.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: But…you called.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, yeah, well…um…I was just calling because,
well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you
do…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can
you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make
it?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came
to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was
time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on
acting?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, I went to law school, if you can believe
that.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I believe it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke -
and a rip-off, so, uh…so I dropped out.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Oh, that’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that
was a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Anything I might know about?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, um, I kind of let things go on this
novel I’d been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is
totally corrupt. I mean, really, it’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I worked over at a homeless shelter for a
while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean,
I have some dignity.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: That’s good. So then what do you do now?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m a documentary filmmaker.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Oh? Anything I might have seen?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: N-not yet. I’m hoping to get a grant for this
one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah. You didn’t wanna take me to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, I don’t remember that…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, but it was so long ago. We were so
different back then…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Uh, well, anyway, so I’m looking for subjects
for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration
of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he’d
like to do the narration. But everything’s still kind of in development
at this point.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah…um…so anyway, tell me. What about you?
I’d heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah. But not any more.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh. Tired of ‘life in the fast lane’?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah…So you’re um…you’re married?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Huh. Kids?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Great. How old are they?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Eight, six, and four.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who
knows, maybe they’ll want to be in my documentary!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Listen, Toby, I can’t really talk right now. Do
you mind if I call you back?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: OK. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Maybe she has caller ID.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: Do you have any hobbies?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: Any books you like to read for fun?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: None at all? How about those
‘underground’ comics?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I hate reading.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: All right, Scooby, let’s not beat
around the bush. With your attitude, you’re not going to get in
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: ‘OK.’ So you just don’t care. Let me
ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but…as a friend: what do you
want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you
possibly have?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: C’mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you’re
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Well, I mean…I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a
talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.</p>
<p><strong>mr. demarco</strong>: Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to
achieve this goal?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I dunno. See if I have any connections.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Did you knock on his door?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Yes, but he just shouted at me and used the
f-word.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Scooby! Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Would anyone be interested in being
hypnotized after dinner?</p>
<p><strong>fern/marty/brady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Let’s just start.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t know what’s wrong with that kid.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Maybe he’s gay.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t ever say that.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: What if he is?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: He isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Marty, ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: He’s vegetarian, doesn’t do sports…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Brady!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: And even if he is…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Gay people are people too, you know. You’re
just being prejudiced.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: I don’t care is he’s gay. I’m cool. I mean,
it’s not like I have to share his room or anything.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I just want to know what the hell he’s doing
in his room that’s so interesting he doesn’t come down for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe he’s building a bomb…just like-!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Don’t even joke about that!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I’m serious! What happens if he blows up the
school?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m going in there.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Was anyone in my room today?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Is everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: My CD case like totally collapsed. I’m gonna
have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Steak’s really good tonight.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Got a lot of homework?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Whaddya mean you don’t know? You either got a
lot or you don’t. What’s not to know?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You started filling out your college
applications yet?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I’m not going to college.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What DO you know?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Dad, I’m trying to figure things out right
now, OK? It’s like, really hard, and I’m just listening to some old
Elton John and…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Out! Leave the table!</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You heard me: leave the table!</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Man, I am out of here! This family is so
fucked!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Mom, it’s not fair if Brady can say the
f-word and I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here’s a
lesson: life’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: I’ll talk to you later, man!</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: Yo, dude!</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Thanks, Esposito!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Yes, Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Do you have any brothers or sisters?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Really? How many?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Four brothers and five sisters.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Wow. Why did your parents have so many
children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn’t it be better to have just
one or two?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: It was God’s will.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But do you really believe in God? And heaven,
hell and angels and all kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So? How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The same. Same as what?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Just the same.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: We’re studying the Holocaust in Social
Studies.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: We did the same thing last year also.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: How was the class?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Well, I’m supposed to watch Schindler’s List
for homework. The movie’s like almost four hours. And then I’m supposed
to write a report on survivors. You know any survivors, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hmmm…Do I know any…personally…?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: He was in a concentration camp?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: But I thought he came over to America before
the war.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Well, he did. With his family. But his
cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he’d stayed,
he would have been killed. So in my book he’s a survivor.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Even though it was only his cousins that were
killed?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: But that could’ve happened to him. Or to me,
if I’d been alive. Or you.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Or me?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: You mean, then, we’re all survivors?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Well…yes. If it hadn’t been for Hitler, he
wouldn’t have had to leave Europe. We would have been…European.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: But then, in a sense, since you would never
have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe…if it weren’t for
Hitler, none of us would have been born.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Get the hell outta here!</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Man, it’s just, like, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>mr kirk</strong>: Tell me: you make a living at this?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, sir…uh…I’m actually not doing this for
the money. When you make a documentary, you do it for many reasons, but
money is certainly not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>mr kirk</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, sir, a lot has happened to the landscape
of the suburban high school since I was a student, and I feel it would
be a valuable, perhaps even enlightening endeavor, to chronicle the
changes, to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in
American schools today.</p>
<p><strong>mr kirk</strong>: Yeah, well, whatever. I’ll let you know if
there’s interest.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Excuse me, where’s the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: You a pervert?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No…Actually, I’m a documentary filmmaker?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, no. I’m doing one on high school
students, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well…it’s kind of a sociological study in the
aftermath of Columbine.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Is this to like get into Sundance?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah, well, it’s possible they would be
interested in it.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Actually, there is some interest from the
Sundance Channel.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Whoopee.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: So you have connections…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You see, we’re trying to do a film on suburban
lifestyles…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: …kind of An American Family for the new
millennium…</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: I thought this was about kids getting into
college.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, it is. I mean �</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Which is it? You gotta keep your focus
straight.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re absolutely right. The focus is on the
college admissions process today.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And you want Scooby to be the focus of all
this?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Scooby and a few other students of different
socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, well, I don’t have them yet, but �</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Either Scooby is the focus, or forget it.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Yeah, I thought I was the focus.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I wanna be the focus.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Toby, we need this to be a positive
experience.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, I suppose I could reconceive…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Reconceive.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: ’Cause Scooby does have a quality that I’ve
been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It’s
part disillusionment, part hope…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Twinkeys!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Boys, take napkins…Napkins…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not to be crass, but what do we get out of
this?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Don’t worry, he doesn’t mean money.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your
story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating
experience.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah…How do we know we won’t be
exploited?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: No, it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mr Livingston, I fully understand and I share
your concerns. You fell vulnerable. And I know that this is a very
difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of
faith in me, in the same way that I have to make a leap of faith in
you?</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: This is a great school. I don’t care what
anybody says. I mean, it’s not perfect, but like the people are really
cool, like the teachers and kids…they really care and all. And I know
that they make fun of New Jersey all the time, but I don’t care. ’Cause
they’re just snobs. ’Cause Jersey is where America’s at!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Walking down these hallways just like the ones
I once walked down as a teenager, I couldn’t help thinking back to a
time when every day I woke up depressed, suicidal, consumed by despair.
Had things changed? Was the competition to get into the most prestigious
schools still a requisite rite of passage? Beneath these masks of
courtesy and friendliness I knew that there were darker forces at
work…and I knew that Scooby was the key to revealing the truth…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Scooby, Scooby, Scooby…What are you thinking?
College, SATs, your parents, your brothers, your friends…How is it you
deal with all this stress?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth st. clair</strong>: The pressure to get into the
college of your choice is incredible. You know, they did a study
recently of the youth in Bosnia during the bombing, and they found that
the stress the young people experienced there was less than what
American high- school students go through when applying to college.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth st. clair</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So whaddya think?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, I’m not really sure what you’re trying
to say. It’s funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make
fun of how idiotic these people are.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m not making fun. I’m showing it as it
really is.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: You’re showing how superior you are to your
subject.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, but I like my subject. I like these
people.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, I do. I love them!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: The camerawork’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Thanks. I’ll tell Mike. Well, it’s still just
a beginning. I know I can…dig deeper.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: …but Marj � may I call you Marj? � what it
really boils down to is…what does it mean to be a Jew?…Exactly.
Tzedakah. Charity. And the new wing at Beth Israel is…Well, actually,
last year you gave $500. But this year $1,000 would not only be a
mitzvah, it would bring you to a new level…Yes, of course. Your gift
would also give you a Chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner
dance this spring…Because it’s true: Israel needs us now. If not now,
when?…Well, that’s wonderful…I’ll speak to you next week…You too! Take
care!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Hi, Scooby! How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Ready for tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: What’s tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: The SATs, knucklehead.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I’m not taking them.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Yes, Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I was looking through Scooby’s SATs practice
books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what
score I got?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: 550 verbal, 520 math. And I’m only in fifth
grade!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Scooby?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Whaddya wanna talk about?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t screw around with me. You know what I’m
talking about. You’re taking those SATs. You’re taking those SATs or
your CD collection is history. You’re taking those SATs and you’re going
to college. You’re taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a
chair, but buddy your taking them.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Tired of this shit…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So are you surprised that Scooby took the SATs
after all?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Not really. He’s kind of a wuss.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were you
surprised?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: I dunno. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Hey, how come you drive such a shitty
car?</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know…That’s interesting, though. A
cool car. Is that something that’s real important to you, Brady?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Uh duh.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Pretty cool, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: How’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s my Dad’s He hides it under some old TV
Guides in his closet.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Gee, your Dad’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Is it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Scooby, don’t! Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I’m not an idiot, man. I watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I Know. I’m sorry. I’m just…a little
nervous, I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: You should be.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Here. You can keep it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Scooby?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know…I like you.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I know. Everyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Oh. Do you think that you’d let me…um…</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: OK. If you feel like it. Just give me a
second.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m so sorry! I should never have made you
take the SATs!</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Hey, Scooby! How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Conan O’Brien? Whoa! What are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: I’m looking for a last-minute guest for my
show. Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I’ll be your guest!</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Really? Well, all right! Let’s take a look at
the television and see how we look.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Welcome to the show, Scooby.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Nice to have you here.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: And thank you for dressing up for us. This is
very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have?
What’s in your future?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Well, I was thinking…I might work for
you.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Ahh…tell me. What do you want to do for me?
What’s your idea?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe
eventually become a TV talk- show host.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick
eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You’ll be a Latin dictator in
a bout a minute.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Let’s see what they think of the first idea.
I’m curious what the audience thinks. Folks, what do you think: should
Scooby be my new sidekick?</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Hey. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: There’s something I need to talk about with
you.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: There are some rumors…</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: You know…Stanley…</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: And like, don’t take this the wrong way…I
mean, I’m cool…but…you know…I’ve got a good reputation at school and,
well…I really don’t want it ruined.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: No prob. I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Thanks, Scoob.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Esposito, What the fuck do you think you’re
doing? You’re tackling like a bitch on my football team, son! You gotta
bend your ass over and hit somebody! You understand me?</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You understand me?</p>
<p><strong>esposito</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Then do it!…Livingston! That’s the way to hit
that hole, son!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: We’re gonna become a football team today,
guys! Let’s move the ball! Move! Move! Move! I wanna see you hit those
holes! Defense, fill those goddam gaps! Let’s go, guys! Let’s do
it!…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: When I’m in high school I’m not going to play
any football. I’m just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you
do in high school?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I did not go to high school.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Weren’t there high schools in El
Salvador?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: We had to work. My family was poor.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Must’ve been hard being poor.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I’m still poor.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor,
don’t you have any hobbies or interests or anything?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: No, Mikey.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But like, what do you like to do when you’re
not working?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I’m always working.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But when you’re not. Like now. What do you
like to do?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: This is work.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But it’s not like real work. This is just
babysitting.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You know, your job’s really not so bad, if
you think about it. You should smile more often.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: When the sky is clear and the sun is warm,
you’re reminded of how beautiful things can be: a lamp post, a sign, a
straw wrapper blowing in the wind�But when that dark cloud appears, you
realize how fragile the balance of life is.</p>
<p><strong>dr jordan</strong>: When Brady first arrived at the hospital
he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli. Wee performed a CT scan which
demonstrated a large subdural hemotoma with mass effect. Since the
removal of the subdural he’s been in coma.</p>
<p><strong>dr goodman</strong>: When I first met the Livingstons it was
in the first twenty four hours of Brady coming in after his tragic
football accident and they were acting in a fairly typical way�</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We’re not the ones who need the help. My son
needs help.</p>
<p><strong>dr goodman</strong>: And you-</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: My son’s in there! He can’t even feed
himself, he can’t eat � I don’t even know if he’s going to be a
vegetable or not, for Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But what about Scooby? How would this effect
him? What meaning is to be found in this?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: This is definitely better.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You think so? You don’t think that this might
not be a little dry?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: This is entertainment you’re making, Toby.
This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college
admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something
much richer and more provocative.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, I know�But still, it should be somewhat
entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I mean, without this footage, without this
rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, no, no. No exploitation. This is
serious�But don’t you find it a little funny too, at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: You’ve got a family tragedy on your hands.
Will you tell me what’s funny about that? About a kid in a coma?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Nothing, I guess�</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I mean, why are you making this documentary
if you can’t treat your subject with appropriate gravity?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: OK, you’re right, you’re right� You know, we
need to screen what we’ve got�invite some regular people, just some
random off-the- street types�and see what real people think of this.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to
go. You still need a lot more footage, and it’s probably a little
premature to start screening�</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: OK, then we can invite serious intellectual
types.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: We’re not ready.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hip alternative types who will understand the
process better�</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: We’re not ready!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, I need to see this with an audience!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: What’s an audience going to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe they’ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo! I spilled some grape juice on the
floor!�Consuelo?!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo. Are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Yes, you are. I can tell. What’s the
matter?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Mi Jesus�mi jesus�</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Speak English.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Mi Jesus esta muerto!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo, I’m sorry, but you know if you
don’t speak English I can’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: My Jesus�</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Who is Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: My baby.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You have a bay?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: My grandchild-baby.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Gee, I didn’t even know you had any children.
But why are you so upset about Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Oh. How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: He was executed. He was on Death Row and
then he was executed.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: How did they execute him?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Poison gas.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe it’s for the best�I mean, if he was
guilty of doing something wrong�People who are bad should be killed.
Don’t you think so?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Jesus was not bad.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe he was and you just didn’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: He wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But still, you can’t be sure.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I am sure.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: But really, you never know.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Why was he on Death Row?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: For rape and murder.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo, what is rape exactly?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: It is when you love someone, and they
don’t love you. And then you do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Sometimes I feel like my parents don’t love
me.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Well then, when you get older you can do
something about it.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Consuelo? I spilled some grape juice
upstairs. Do you think you could clean up the floor now?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Dad?�Do you think that Brady will ever get
better?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: One in a million recover.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe he’s that one in a million!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mikey, there’s optimism, and then there’s
stupidity. It’s a very fine line.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I don’t think there’s any hope, either. I was
just trying to make you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You’re welcome. Dad?�Would you let me try
hypnotizing you now?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: OK. Stay there. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Just a sec!�Be right there!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Dad, can you turn around a bit, please?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Thanks. All right. Now you must look at this
shiny object and concentrate. Relax your legs. Relax your arms. Relax
your shoulders. Now keep your eyes on the shiny object�Your eyelids are
getting heavy�heavier�You’re getting sleepy�sleepier�Now let your eyes
close shut�and you are asleep.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Now you are completely under my power. I am
the only voice you can hear, the only voice you will listen to. Now.
When you wake up you will be in a good mood. You won’t worry so much
about Brady. And I will be your favorite from now on. If Brady dies, you
can be sad for a little bit, but I will still be the most important
person in your life. You will never be mean to me, and always give me
whatever I want. Also, you should fire Consuelo. She’s lazy. Now when I
snap my fingers, you will remember nothing, but you will do everything I
have asked. One. Two. Three.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: So like, yeah�I caved in. I mean, I had to.
My parents, they’re like �still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote
the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the
interviews�Y’know, I figure I can always drop out.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: So where’d you get in?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Prnceton.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But what did you get on your SATs?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know.
But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We used pull.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have
to, Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: But what kind of pull did you have?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni
fund.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: It’s all about who you know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Look, we’re not suckers. Everyone else is out
there doing the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Damn, Toby�This thing won’t open again.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Let me try it, let me try it. It’s um�The
button is just stuck.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering�Is the
documentary almost finished?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Uh, yeah, we’re getting there.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Can I see what you have so far?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure�um�yeah, as soon as I have a screening
I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Thanks man.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Gin! I win! Let’s play again!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Mikey!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Hi, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come here, give me a hug!</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Gee, you’re home early!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, uh, listen. Why don’t you go upstairs
and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone
with Consuelo for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Sure, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Consuelo. Mrs. Livingston and I have
discussed this, and we’ve come to the conclusion that we are not very
happy with your work lately, so we’re going to let you go.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: I-I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We’ve been happy with you in the past, but
now we think maybe it’s time for a change�uh�I know you’ve had trouble
at home and maybe, you know, some of that is reflected I your work�</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: But, Mr Livingston, I work very hard for
you and your family!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I understand, I understand that, and I’m
sorry it had to end this way.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Florsheim. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Hi. I�uh…I’m trying to reach Toby Oxman?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Sorry, he’s off today.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: OK�um�Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Hey, uh, Mike. Is Toby here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Uh, no, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Oh. Do you have any idea where he might
be?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think he’s at a test screening.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I think Scooby’s like a lot of kids. He just
hit a�a speed bump. Now he’s gonna find his way, his path is gonna be
cleared, and I think he’s gonna continue his education at a good
college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: …But Mr Livingston, aren’t you a bit fearful
that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic
conformism?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t know why this is so hard for you to
comprehend. I had a terrific time in college. I’ve got a terrific job, a
comfortable salary, terrific wife, three terrific kids�and every year I
give to the alumni fund. Now why are you trying to make college out to
be a bad thing, a negative experience? You were unhappy? Well, to bad!
Get over it! Stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around
saying, ‘Life is bad, life is horrible.’ Life is tough on you? Well, boo
hoo!</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: …Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a goofball. I
just have to pretend to go along with his ideas. ’Cause he really
doesn’t get it: like I could be the next Oprah, for all he knows, but
he’s never even seen the show.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What is most important to you?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: I dunno. I’d like to be good at something.
It doesn’t have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies…Anything. I’d be
willing to direct.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: But I’d like to be, you know…famous. Not
necessarily a superstar, just famous. Be recognized. Get fan Mail.
Things…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to
be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O’Brien, but did you know
even he went to college?</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yeah. He went to Harward.</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Mom? Dad? Can I sleep with you? I’m
scared.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure!…</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Snug as a bug in a rug. Yeah, here you go,
pal. All righty…You’re monster-proofed!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh, my God, Scooby! I’m so sorry…I’m so, so
sorry…</p>
<p><strong>scooby</strong>: Don’t be. Your movie’s a hit.</p>
